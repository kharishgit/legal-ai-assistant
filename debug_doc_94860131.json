So far as the criminal appeal arising out of SLP (Crl.) No.\n\n9859/2013 is concerned, it is required to be noted that the\n\naccused were facing the criminal proceedings for the offences\n\npunishable under <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_33\">Sections 307</a>, <a href=\"/doc/594493/\" id=\"a_34\">294</a> and <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_35\">34</a> of the IPC.

Nothing in on record to\n\nshow, whether in fact the respondent no.1 herein, the main\n\naccused – original accused no.1 was arrested or not. It appears\n\nthat during the investigation, immediately, the original accused\n\nno.1 – Dhruv Gurjar approached the High Court on 5.4.2013 by\n\nfiling an application under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 482</a> of the Cr.P.C. for\n\nquashing the FIR. Immediately on the fourth day of filing of the\n\napplication,   by   the   impugned   judgment   and   order   dated\n\n8.4.2013, the High Court has quashed the FIR solely on the\n\nground that there is a settlement arrived at between the\n\ncomplainant and the accused. While quashing the FIR, the High\n\nCourt has relied upon the decision of this Court in the case of\n\nShjji (supra), specially the observations recorded by this Court\n\n“that where there is no chance of recording conviction against the\n\naccused persons and the entire exercise of a trial destined to be\n\nexercise of futility, the criminal case registered against the\n\naccused persons, though it may not be compoundable, can be\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                                                  9</span>\n\fquashed by the High Court in exercise of powers under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_38\">Section\n\n482</a> of the Cr.P.C”.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_18\">12.

The position that emerges from the above\n        discussion can be summarised thus: the power of\n        the High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">                                                                17</span>\n\fFIR or complaint in exercise of its inherent\njurisdiction is distinct and different from the power\ngiven to a criminal court for compounding the\noffences under Section 320 of the Code. Inherent\npower is of wide plenitude with no statutory\nlimitation but it has to be exercised in accord with\nthe guideline engrafted in such power viz.: (i) to\nsecure the ends of justice, or (ii) to prevent abuse of\nthe process of any court. In what cases power to\nquash the criminal proceeding or complaint or FIR\nmay be exercised where the offender and the victim\nhave settled their dispute would depend on the facts\nand circumstances of each case and no category can\nbe prescribed. However, before exercise of such\npower, the High Court must have due regard to the\nnature and gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious\noffences of mental depravity or offences like murder,\nrape, dacoity, etc. cannot be fittingly quashed even\nthough the victim or victim’s family and the offender\nhave settled the dispute. Such offences are not\nprivate in nature and have a serious impact on\nsociety. Similarly, any compromise between the\nvictim and the offender in relation to the offences\nunder special statutes like the <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_88\">Prevention of\nCorruption Act</a> or the offences committed by public\nservants while working in that capacity, etc.; cannot\nprovide for any basis for quashing criminal\nproceedings involving such offences. But the criminal\ncases having overwhelmingly and predominatingly\ncivil flavour stand on a different footing for the\npurposes of quashing, particularly the offences\narising from commercial, financial, mercantile, civil,\npartnership or such like transactions or the offences\narising out of matrimony relating to dowry, etc. or\nthe family disputes where the wrong is basically\nprivate or personal in nature and the parties have\nresolved their entire dispute. In this category of\ncases, the High Court may quash the criminal\nproceedings if in its view, because of the compromise\nbetween the offender and the victim, the possibility\nof conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">                                                          18</span>\n\f       the criminal case would put the accused to great\n       oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice\n       would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal\n       case despite full and complete settlement and\n       compromise with the victim. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"69949024\" id=\"span_35\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"160278245\" id=\"span_36\">In other words, the High\n       Court must consider whether it would be unfair or\n       contrary to the interest of justice to continue with\n       the criminal proceeding or continuation of the\n       criminal proceeding would tantamount to abuse of\n       process of law despite settlement and compromise\n       between the victim and the wrongdoer and whether\n       to secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that\n       the criminal case is put to an end and if the answer\n       to the above question(s) is in the affirmative, the\n       High Court shall be well within its jurisdiction to\n       quash the criminal proceeding.”\n\n\n\n\n16.3      In the case of <a href=\"/doc/160278245/\" id=\"a_89\">Narinder Singh vs. State of Punjab</a> (2014)\n\n6 SCC 466, after considering the decision in the case of <a href=\"/doc/69949024/\" id=\"a_90\">Gian\n\nSingh</a> (supra), in paragraph 29, this Court summed up as under:</span></span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">       “29. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we sum up\n       and lay down the following principles by which the\n       High Court would be guided in giving adequate\n       treatment to the settlement between the parties and\n       exercising its power under Section 482 of the Code\n       while accepting the settlement and quashing the\n       proceedings or refusing to accept the settlement with\n       direction to continue with the criminal proceedings:\n       29.1. Power conferred under Section 482 of the Code\n       is to be distinguished from the power which lies in\n       the Court to compound the offences under Section\n       320 of the Code. No doubt, under Section 482 of the\n           Code, the High Court has inherent power to\n       quash the criminal proceedings even in those cases\n       which are not compoundable, where the parties have\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">                                                                19</span>\n\fsettled the matter between themselves. However, this\npower is to be exercised sparingly and with caution.\n29.2. When the parties have reached the settlement\nand on that basis petition for quashing the criminal\nproceedings is filed, the guiding factor in such cases\nwould be to secure:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">     (i) ends of justice, or\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">     (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any court.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\">While exercising the power the High Court is to form\nan opinion on either of the aforesaid two objectives.\n29.3. Such a power is not to be exercised in those\nprosecutions which involve heinous and serious\noffences of mental depravity or offences like murder,\nrape, dacoity, etc. Such offences are not private in\nnature and have a serious impact on society.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_31\">Similarly, for the offences alleged to have been\ncommitted under special statute like the <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_91\">Prevention\nof Corruption Act</a> or the offences committed by\npublic servants while working in that capacity are\nnot to be quashed merely on the basis of compromise\nbetween the victim and the offender.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_32\">29.4. On the other hand, those criminal cases having\noverwhelmingly and predominantly civil character,\nparticularly those arising out of commercial\ntransactions or arising out of matrimonial\nrelationship or family disputes should be quashed\nwhen the parties have resolved their entire disputes\namong themselves.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_33\">29.5. While exercising its powers, the High Court is\nto examine as to whether the possibility of conviction\nis remote and bleak and continuation of criminal\ncases would put the accused to great oppression and\nprejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to\nhim by not quashing the criminal cases.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_34\">29.6. Offences under <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_92\">Section 307</a> IPC would fall in\nthe category of heinous and serious offences and\ntherefore are to be generally treated as crime against\nthe society and not against the individual alone.\nHowever, the High Court would not rest its decision\nmerely because there is a mention of <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_93\">Section 307</a> IPC\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">                                                          20</span>\n\fin the FIR or the charge is framed under this\nprovision. It would be open to the High Court to\nexamine as to whether incorporation of <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_94\">Section 307</a>\nIPC is there for the sake of it or the prosecution has\ncollected sufficient evidence, which if proved, would\nlead to proving the charge under <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_95\">Section 307</a> IPC.\nFor this purpose, it would be open to the High Court\nto go by the nature of injury sustained, whether such\ninjury is inflicted on the vital/delegate parts of the\nbody, nature of weapons used, etc. Medical report in\nrespect of injuries suffered by the victim can\ngenerally be the guiding factor. On the basis of this\nprima facie analysis, the High Court can examine as\nto whether there is a strong possibility of conviction\nor the chances of conviction are remote and bleak. In\nthe former case it can refuse to accept the settlement\nand quash the criminal proceedings whereas in the\nlatter case it would be permissible for the High Court\nto accept the plea compounding the offence based on\ncomplete settlement between the parties. At this\nstage, the Court can also be swayed by the fact that\nthe settlement between the parties is going to result\nin harmony between them which may improve their\nfuture relationship.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_35\">29.7. While deciding whether to exercise its power\nunder Section 482 of the Code or not, timings of\nsettlement play a crucial role. Those cases where the\nsettlement is arrived at immediately after the alleged\ncommission of offence and the matter is still under\ninvestigation, the High Court may be liberal in\naccepting the settlement to quash the criminal\nproceedings/investigation. It is because of the\nreason that at this stage the investigation is still on\nand even the charge­sheet has not been filed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_36\">Likewise, those cases where the charge is framed\nbut the evidence is yet to start or the evidence is still\nat infancy stage, the High Court can show\nbenevolence in exercising its powers favourably, but\nafter     prima     facie    assessment       of    the\ncircumstances/material mentioned above. On the\nother hand, where the prosecution evidence is\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">                                                            21</span>\n\f           almost complete or after the conclusion of the\n           evidence the matter is at the stage of argument,\n           normally the High Court should refrain from\n           exercising its power under Section 482 of the Code,\n           as in such cases the trial court would be in a\n           position to decide the case finally on merits and to\n           come to a conclusion as to whether the offence\n           under <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_96\">Section 307</a> IPC is committed or not.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">           <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7293093\" id=\"span_40\">Similarly, in those cases where the conviction is\n           already recorded by the trial court and the matter is\n           at the appellate stage before the High Court, mere\n           compromise between the parties would not be a\n           ground to accept the same resulting in acquittal of\n           the offender who has already been convicted by the\n           trial court. Here charge is proved under <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_97\">Section 307</a>\n           IPC and conviction is already recorded of a heinous\n           crime and, therefore, there is no question of sparing\n           a convict found guilty of such a crime.”\n\n\n16.4         In the case of <a href=\"/doc/7293093/\" id=\"a_98\">Parbatbhai Aahir</a> (supra), again this\n\nCourt has had an occasion to consider whether the High Court\n\ncan quash the FIR/complaint/criminal proceedings, in exercise\n\nof   the    inherent   jurisdiction   under   <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_99\">Section   482</a>   Cr.P.C.\n\nConsidering a catena of decisions of this Court on the point, this\n\nCourt summarised the following propositions:</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">             “(1) <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_100\">Section 482</a> CrPC preserves the inherent powers\n           of the High Court to prevent an abuse of the process of\n           any court or to secure the ends of justice. The provision\n           does not confer new powers. It only recognises and\n           preserves powers which inhere in the High Court.\n             (2) The invocation of the jurisdiction of the High\n           Court to quash a first information report or a criminal\n           proceeding on the ground that a settlement has been\n           arrived at between the offender and the victim is not the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">                                                                   22</span>\n\fsame as the invocation of jurisdiction for the purpose of\ncompounding an offence.          While compounding an\noffence, the power of the court is governed by the\nprovisions of <a href=\"/doc/91933/\" id=\"a_101\">Section 320</a> CrPC. The power to quash\nunder Section 482 is attracted even if the offence is non­\ncompoundable.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">   (3) In forming an opinion whether a criminal\nproceeding or complaint should be quashed in exercise of\nits jurisdiction under Section 482, the High Court must\nevaluate whether the ends of justice would justify the\nexercise of the inherent power.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">   (4) While the inherent power of the High Court has a\nwide ambit and plenitude it has to be exercised (i) to\nsecure the ends of justice, or (ii) to prevent an abuse of\nthe process of any court.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">   (5) the decision as to whether a complaint or first\ninformation report should be quashed on the ground that\nthe offender and victim have settled the dispute, revolves\nultimately on the facts and circumstances of each case\nand no exhaustive elaboration of principles can be\nformulate.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">   (6) In the exercise of the power under Section 482\nand while dealing with a plea that the dispute has been\nsettled, the High Court must have due regard to the\nnature and gravity of the offence. Heinous and serious\noffences involving mental depravity or offences such as\nmurder, rape and dacoity cannot appropriately be\nquashed though the victim or the family of the victim\nhave settled the dispute.       Such offences are, truly\nspeaking, not private in nature but have a serious impact\nupon society. The decision to continue with the trial in\nsuch cases is founded on the overriding element of public\ninterest in punishing persons for serious offences.\n   (7) As distinguished from serious offences, there may\nbe criminal cases which have an overwhelming or\npredominant element of a civil dispute. They stand on a\ndistinct footing insofar as the exercise of the inherent\npower to quash is concerned.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">   (8) Criminal cases involving offences which arise\nfrom commercial, financial, mercantile, partnership or\nsimilar transactions with an essentially civil flavour may\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">                                                        23</span>\n\f        in appropriate situations fall for quashing where parties\n        have settled the dispute.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">           <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"16596453\" id=\"span_43\">(9) In such a case, the High Court may quash the\n        criminal proceeding if in view of the compromise between\n        the disputants, the possibility of a conviction is remote\n        and the continuation of a criminal proceeding would\n        cause oppression and prejudice; and\n           (10) There is yet an exception to the principle set out\n        in Propositions (8) and (9) above. Economic offences\n        involving the financial and economic well­being of the\n        State have implications which lie beyond the domain of a\n        mere dispute between private disputants. The High\n        Court would be justified in declining to quash where the\n        offender is involved in an activity akin to a financial or\n        economic fraud or misdemeanour. The consequences of\n        the act complained of upon the financial or economic\n        system will weigh in the balance.”\n\n\n16.5      In the case of      <a href=\"/doc/16596453/\" id=\"a_102\">Manish</a> (supra), this Court has\n\nspecifically observed and held that, when it comes to the question\n\nof compounding an offence under <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_103\">Sections 307</a>, <a href=\"/doc/594493/\" id=\"a_104\">294</a> and <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_105\">34</a> IPC\n\n(as in the appeal @ SLP(Crl.)

It is observed\n\nthat such offences will have a serious impact on the society at\n\nlarge. It is further observed that where the accused are facing\n\ntrial under Sections 307, 294 read with <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_108\">Section 34</a> IPC as well as\n\n<a href=\"/doc/73862/\" id=\"a_109\">Sections 25</a> and <a href=\"/doc/244673/\" id=\"a_110\">27</a> of the Arms Act, as the offences are definitely\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">                                                                24</span>\n\fagainst the society, accused will have to necessarily face trial and\n\ncome out unscathed by demonstrating their innocence.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"115365177\" id=\"span_45\">16.6      In the case of <a href=\"/doc/115365177/\" id=\"a_111\">Deepak</a> (supra), this Court has\n\nspecifically observed that as offence under <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_112\">Section 307</a> IPC is\n\nnon­compoundable and as the offence under Section 307 is not a\n\nprivate dispute between the parties inter se, but is a crime\n\nagainst the society, quashing of the proceedings on the basis of a\n\ncompromise is not permissible.</span> Similar is the view taken by this\n\nCourt in a recent decision of this Court in the case of Kalyan\n\nSingh (supra).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">17.

It appears that the High Court has misread or\n\nmisapplied <a href=\"/doc/1282121/\" id=\"a_114\">the said decision</a> to the facts of the cases on hand.\n\nThe High Court ought to have appreciated that it is not in every\n\ncase where the complainant has entered into a compromise with\n\nthe accused, there may not be any conviction. Such observations\n\nare presumptive and many a time too early to opine. In a given\n\ncase, it may happen that the prosecution still can prove the guilt\n\nby leading cogent evidence and examining the other witnesses\n\nand the relevant evidence/material, more particularly when the\n\ndispute is not a commercial transaction and/or of a civil nature\n\nand/or is not a private wrong.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1282121\" id=\"span_48\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/1282121/\" id=\"a_115\">Shiji</a> (supra), this\n\nCourt found that the case had its origin in the civil dispute\n\nbetween the parties, which dispute was resolved by them and\n\ntherefore this Court observed that, ‘that being so, continuance of\n\nthe prosecution where the complainant is not ready to support\n\nthe allegations…will be a futile exercise that will serve no\n\npurpose’.

The\n        width and the nature of the power itself demands\n        that its exercise is sparing and only in cases where\n        the High Court is, for reasons to be recorded, of the\n        clear view that continuance of the prosecution would\n        be nothing but an abuse of the process of law. It is\n        neither necessary nor proper for us to enumerate the\n        situations in which the exercise of power under\n        Section 482 may be justified. All that we need to say\n        is that the exercise of power must be for securing the\n        ends of justice and only in cases where refusal to\n        exercise that power may result in the abuse of the\n        process of law. The High Court may be justified in\n        declining interference if it is called upon to\n        appreciate evidence for it cannot assume the role of\n        an appellate court while dealing with a petition\n        under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_119\">Section 482</a> of the Criminal Procedure Code.\n        Subject to the above, the High Court will have to\n        consider the facts and circumstances of each case to\n        determine whether it is a fit case in which the\n        inherent powers may be invoked.”\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">                                                                 27</span>\n\f18.1      Therefore<a href=\"/doc/1282121/\" id=\"a_120\">, <a href=\"/doc/1282121/\" id=\"a_121\">the said decision</a></a> may be applicable in a\n\ncase which has its origin in the civil dispute between the parties;</span>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1282121\" id=\"span_52\">the parties have resolved the dispute; that the offence is not\n\nagainst the society at large and/or the same may not have social\n\nimpact; the dispute is a family/matrimonial dispute etc.       The\n\naforesaid decision may not be applicable in a case where the\n\noffences alleged are very serious and grave offences, having a\n\nsocial impact like offences under <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_122\">Section 307</a> IPC and 25/27 of\n\nthe <a href=\"/doc/1934415/\" id=\"a_123\">Arms Act</a> etc. Therefore, without proper application of mind\n\nto the relevant facts and circumstances, in our view, the High\n\nCourt has materially erred in mechanically quashing the\n\nrespective FIRs, by observing that in view of the compromise,\n\nthere are no chances of recording conviction and/or the further\n\ntrial would be an exercise in futility.

The High Court\n\nhas also not considered the antecedents of the accused. It has\n\ncome on record that the accused persons were facing number of\n\ntrials for the serious offences.
