Appellant herein had not been charged for abetment of a crime. Any\n\nconspiracy amongst the accused persons has also not been alleged.             A\n\nwoman in terms of the aforementioned provision must be subjected to\n\ncruelty by her husband and/or his relative. The word `cruelty&#x27; has also been\n\ndefined in the explanation appended thereto. It is in two parts. Clause (a) of\n\nthe said explanation refers to a conduct which is likely to drive the woman to\n\ncommit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to her life, limb or health\n\n(whether mental or physical); clause (b) provides for harassment of the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                                                          6</span>\n\fwoman, where such harassment, is with a view to coercing her or any person\n\nrelated to her to meet any unlawful demand for any property or valuable\n\nsecurity.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_23\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_24\">      It is not the case of the first informant that the appellant had any role\n\nto play with regard to demand of dowry.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_25\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_26\">11.   The word `cruelty&quot; having been defined in terms of the aforesaid\n\nexplanation, no other meaning can be attributed thereto. Living with another\n\nwoman may be an act of cruelty on the part of the husband for the purpose\n\nof judicial separation or dissolution of marriage but the same, in our opinion,\n\nwould not attract the wrath of <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 498A</a> of the Indian Penal Code.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_27\">      An offence in terms of the said provision is committed by the persons\n\nspecified therein.

In the absence of any statutory definition, the term `relative&#x27; must be\n\nassigned a meaning as is commonly understood. Ordinarily it would include\n\nfather, mother, husband or wife, son, daughter, brother, sister, nephew or\n\nniece, grandson or grand-daughter of an individual or the spouse of any\n\nperson.

The test under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_49\">Section 498A</a> IPC is whether\n            in the facts of each case, it is probable that a\n            woman is treated by friends, relatives, husband or\n            society as a &quot;wife&quot; or as a mere &quot;mistress&quot;. If from\n            the pleadings and evidence the Court finds that the\n            woman concerned is regarded as wife and not as a\n            mere mistress, she can be considered to be a &#x27;wife&#x27;\n            and consequently as &#x27;the relative of the husband&#x27;\n            for purpose of <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_50\">Section 498A</a> IPC. Proof of a legal\n            marriage in the rigid sense as required under civil\n            law is unnecessary for establishing an offence\n            under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 498A</a> IPC. The expression\n            &quot;marriage&quot; or &quot;relative&quot; can be given only a\n            diluted meaning which a common man or society\n            may attribute to those concepts in the common\n            parlance, for the purpose of <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 498A</a> IPC. A\n            second wife who is treated as wife by the husband,\n            relatives, friends or society can be considered to be\n            &#x27;the relative of the husband&#x27; for the purpose of\n            <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_53\">Section 498A</a> of IPC. If she inflicts cruelty on the\n            legally-wedded wife of the husband, an offence\n            under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_54\">Section 498A</a> IPC will not lie against her.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">                                                                        16</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_56\">\f21.
