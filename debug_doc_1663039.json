The Sub-Divisional\n\nMagistrate recorded the statement of Smt.

Shri K.T.S. Tulsi, senior counsel appearing for the appellant, assailed\n\nthe impugned judgment on two counts. He argued that the appellant&#x27;s\n\nconviction under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 498A</a> IPC is liable to be set aside because he was\n\ntried for an offence under <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 304B</a> read with 34 <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_21\">IPC</a> and not under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 498A</a> IPC. Learned senior counsel submitted that in the absence of\n\na specific charge under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 498A</a> IPC, the High Court could not have\n\nconvicted the appellant under that section because he did not get\n\nopportunity to defend himself. Shri Tulsi further argued that after having\n\ndiscarded the testimony of PW-1, PW-6 and PW-7 on the issue of\n\nharassment, cruelty and demand of dowry and acquitted the appellant of the\n\ncharge under <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 304B</a> IPC, the High Court could not have relied upon\n\nthe same evidence for the purpose of convicting him under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 498A</a>\n\nIPC. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"337402\" id=\"span_4\">In support of his arguments, Shri Tulsi referred to the judgments of this\n\nCourt in <a href=\"/doc/337402/\" id=\"a_26\">State of West Bengal vs. Orilal Jaiswal &amp; Another</a> [1994 (1)\n\nSCC 73],Himachal Pradesh Admn.</span> vs. Shri Om Prakash [1972 (2) SCR\n\n765], Ramakant Rai vs. Madan Rai &amp; Others [JT 2003 (Supp.2) SC\n\n344], Gokaraju Venkatanarasa Raju vs. State of A.P.

Shri Malhotra submitted that the evidence produced by the\n\nprosecution was sufficient to prove that the appellant had subjected the\n\ndeceased to cruelty and the High Court did not commit any error by\n\nconvicting him under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 498A</a> IPC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_16\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_17\">5.

For deciding whether\n\nthe High Court committed an illegality by convicting the appellant under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 498A</a> IPC, it will be useful to notice the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/649942/\" id=\"a_36\">Sections 221</a>,\n\n<a href=\"/doc/384218/\" id=\"a_37\">222</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1745798/\" id=\"a_38\">464</a> of the Code.

In view of the apparently conflicting judgments of the coordinate\n\nBenches, the issue was referred to a larger Bench. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"573333\" id=\"span_22\">In <a href=\"/doc/573333/\" id=\"a_84\">Dalbir Singh vs.\n\nState of U.P.</a> [2004 (5) SCC 334], a three Judges&#x27; Bench considered the\n\nprovisions of Section 222 and 464 of the Code and observed:-</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">      &quot;Sub-section (1) of Section 222 lays down that when a person\n      is charged with an offence consisting of several particulars, a\n      combination of some only of which constitutes a complete\n      minor offence, and such combination is proved, but the\n      remaining particulars are not proved, he may be convicted of\n      the minor offence, though he was not charged with it. Sub-\n      section (2) of the same section lays down that when a person is\n      charged with an offence and facts are proved which reduce it to\n      a minor offence, he may be convicted of the minor offence,\n      although he is not charged with it. <a href=\"/doc/1176662/\" id=\"a_85\">Section 222</a> CrPC is in the\n      nature of a general provision which empowers the court to\n      convict for a minor offence even though charge has been\n      framed for a major offence. Illustrations (a) and (b) to the said\n      section also make the position clear. However, there is a\n      separate chapter in the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_86\">Code of Criminal Procedure</a>, namely,\n      Chapter XXXV which deals with irregular proceedings and\n      their effect. This chapter enumerates various kinds of\n      irregularities which have the effect of either vitiating or not\n      vitiating the proceedings. Section 464 of the Code deals with\n      the effect of omission to frame, or absence of, or error in,\n      charge. Sub-section (1) of this section provides that no finding,\n      sentence or order by a court of competent jurisdiction shall be\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">\f                                                                            16</span>\n\n\n      deemed invalid merely on the ground that no charge was\n      framed or on the ground of any error, omission or irregularity\n      in the charge including any misjoinder of charges, unless, in\n      the opinion of the court of appeal, confirmation or revision, a\n      failure of justice has in fact been occasioned thereby. This\n      clearly shows that any error, omission or irregularity in the\n      charge including any misjoinder of charges shall not result in\n      invalidating the conviction or order of a competent court unless\n      the appellate or revisional court comes to the conclusion that a\n      failure of justice has in fact been occasioned thereby.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_43\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1347962\" id=\"span_24\">13.   The three Judges&#x27; Bench then referred to the earlier judgments in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1347962/\" id=\"a_87\">Willie (William) Slaney vs. State of M.P.</a> (supra), Gurbachan Singh vs.\n\nState of Punjab (supra) and observed:-</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">      &quot;There is a catena of decisions of this Court on the same lines\n      and it is not necessary to burden this judgment by making\n      reference to each one of them. Therefore, in view of <a href=\"/doc/936345/\" id=\"a_88\">Section\n      464</a> CrPC, it is possible for the appellate or revisional court to\n      convict an accused for an offence for which no charge was\n      framed unless the court is of the opinion that a failure of justice\n      would in fact occasion. In order to judge whether a failure of\n      justice has been occasioned, it will be relevant to examine\n      whether the accused was aware of the basic ingredients of the\n      offence for which he is being convicted and whether the main\n      facts sought to be established against him were explained to\n      him clearly and whether he got a fair chance to defend himself.\n      We are, therefore, of the opinion that Sangaraboina Sreenu\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">\f                                                                         17</span>\n\n\n      was not correctly decided as it purports to lay down as a\n      principle of law that where the accused is charged under\n      <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_89\">Section 302</a> IPC, he cannot be convicted for the offence under\n      <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_90\">Section 306</a> IPC.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_44\">14.   The ratio of the above noted judgments is that in certain situations an\n\naccused can be convicted of an offence with which he may not have been\n\nspecifically charged and that an error, omission or irregularity in the\n\nframing of charge is, by itself not sufficient for upsetting the conviction.\n\nThe appellate, confirming or revisional Court can interfere in such matters\n\nonly if it is shown that error, omission or irregularity in the framing of\n\ncharge has caused prejudice to the accused and failure of justice has been\n\noccasioned.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_45\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_46\">15.   Reverting to the facts of this case, we find that the appellant and his\n\nco-accused were charged under <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_91\">Section 304B</a> IPC. The specific allegation\n\nlevelled against them was that they had subjected the deceased to cruelty for\n\nor in connection with demand for dowry and she had died unnatural death\n\nwithin seven years of her marriage. Thus, the appellant knew that he was to\n\ndefend himself against the allegation of cruelty. The cross-examination of\n\nprosecution witnesses unmistakably shows that the defense had made\n\nconcerted effort to discredit the testimony of mother, sisters and brother of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">\f                                                                            18</span>\n\n\nthe deceased in the context of allegation of cruelty. Not only this in his\n\nstatement under Section 313 of the Code, the appellant denied the allegation\n\nthat he had subjected his wife to cruelty. It is thus evident that the appellant\n\nwas not only aware of the charge of cruelty but he got and availed the\n\nopportunity to defend himself with reference to that charge. Therefore, it is\n\nnot possible to accept the submission of Shri Tulsi that omission of the trial\n\ncourt to frame specific charge under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_92\">Section 498A</a> IPC had prejudiced the\n\ncause of his client or that failure of justice had been occasioned on that\n\ncount.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_47\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_48\">16.      The next point which requires consideration is whether after\n\ndiscarding the testimony of PW-1, PW-6 and PW-7 and acquitting the\n\nappellant of the charge under <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_93\">Section 304B</a> IPC, the High Court could\n\nconvict him under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_94\">Section 498A</a> IPC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_49\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_50\">17.      Section 498A was added to the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_95\">IPC</a> by amending Act No.46 of 1983\n\nin the backdrop of growing menace of dowry related cases in which the\n\nwomen were subjected to cruelty and harassment and were forced to commit\n\nsuicide. This section lays down that if the husband or his relative subjects a\n\nwoman to cruelty, then he/she is liable to be punished with imprisonment\n\nfor a term which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to fine.\n\nExplanation appended to this section defines the term `cruelty&#x27; to mean any\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">\f                                                                        19</span>\n\n\nwillful conduct which is of such a nature as is likely to drive the woman to\n\ncommit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health\n\n(whether mental or physical) of the woman; or harassment of the woman\n\nwhere such harassment is with a view to coercing her or any person related\n\nto her to meet any unlawful demand for any property or valuable security or\n\nis on account of failure by her or any person related to her to meet such\n\ndemand.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_51\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_52\">18.   After three years, Section 304B was inserted by amending Act No.43\n\nof 1986 to deal with cases involving dowry deaths occurring within seven\n\nyears of marriage. Sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_96\">Section 304B</a> IPC lays down that\n\nwhere the death of a woman is caused by any burns or bodily injury or\n\noccurs otherwise than under normal circumstances within seven years of her\n\nmarriage and it is shown that soon before her death she was subjected to\n\ncruelty or harassment by her husband or any relative of her husband for, or\n\nin connection with, any demand for dowry, such death shall be called\n\n`dowry death&#x27;, and such husband or relative shall be deemed to have caused\n\nher death. By virtue of explanation appearing below sub-section (1), the\n\nword `dowry&#x27; used therein carries the same meaning as is contained in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1249134/\" id=\"a_97\">Section 2</a> of The Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">\f                                                                          20</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_53\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_54\">19.

In order to bring home charge under <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_100\">Section 304B</a> IPC, the\n\nprosecution is required to establish that the death of the woman has been\n\ncaused by burns or bodily injury or otherwise than under normal\n\ncircumstances within seven years of her marriage and soon before her death,\n\nthe woman is subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or his\n\nrelative. However, for the purpose of conviction under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_101\">Section 498A</a> IPC, it\n\nis sufficient to prove that the woman was subjected to cruelty, as elucidated\n\nin the explanation appearing below substantive part of the section, by her\n\nhusband or his relative.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_56\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_57\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"5078981\" id=\"span_29\">21.   A reading of the impugned judgment shows that after recording a\n\nfinding that there was no evidence to prove that the deceased was treated\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">\f                                                                         21</span>\n\n\nwith cruelty or harassment in connection with demand of dowry soon before\n\nher death, the High Court referred to the judgments of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/5078981/\" id=\"a_102\">Pyare\n\nLal vs. State of Haryana</a> (supra) and Satpal vs. State of Haryana (supra)\n\nand held that evidence on record clearly makes out an offence under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_103\">Section\n\n498A</a> IPC against the appellant.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_58\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_59\">22.   Although the judgment under challenge does not contain an elaborate\n\ndiscussion with reference to the ingredients of <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_104\">Section 498A</a> IPC, having\n\ncarefully gone through the statements of PW-1, PW-6, PW-7, PW-14 and\n\nPW-26, we are convinced that the prosecution succeeded in proving that the\n\nappellant had subjected the deceased to cruelty within the meaning of clause\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_60\">(a) of explanation appearing below <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_105\">Section 498A</a> IPC and the mere fact that\n\nthe statements of three of them were not found convincing by the High\n\nCourt for sustaining the conviction of the appellant and his other co-accused\n\non the premise that all the ingredients of <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_106\">Section 304B</a> IPC have not been\n\nestablished is not sufficient to discard the prosecution case as a whole. PW-\n\n1, PW-6 (both sisters), PW-7 (mother) and PW-26 (brother) have\n\ncategorically deposed that immediately after marriage the deceased was\n\ngiven beating by the appellant, his brothers and was subjected to harassment\n\nand taunting by mother-in-law and sister-in-law for being dark\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">\f                                                                        22</span>\n\n\ncomplexioned and illiterate/not fluent in English. Their statements also\n\nshow that the appellant had hit the deceased with a brick resulting in wound\n\non her head which had to be stitched. On the date of death also, the\n\ndeceased was subjected to physical torture and harassment. Both the sisters\n\nnarrated that when they met the deceased, she was weeping and her eyes\n\nwere swollen. Their testimony has been substantially supported by PW-14\n\nRakesh Malhotra. He too stated that the deceased was subjected to beating\n\nby her husband and she had suffered injury on her head. This part of the\n\nprosecution case has not been disbelieved by the High Court which found\n\ndiscrepancy only on the issue of demand of dowry. The beating given to the\n\ndeceased and harassment to which she was subjected had direct bearing on\n\nher committing suicide. Therefore, we are convinced that the High Court\n\ndid not commit any error in convicting the appellant under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_107\">Section 498A</a>\n\nIPC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_61\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_62\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"337402\" id=\"span_32\">23.    The judgments on which Shri Tulsi has placed reliance do not support\n\nthe cause of the appellant. Rather, the judgment in <a href=\"/doc/337402/\" id=\"a_108\">State of West Bengal\n\nvs. Orilal Jaiswal &amp; Another</a> (supra) supports the conclusion that an\n\noffence under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_109\">Section 498A</a> IPC is made out if the woman is subjected to\n\nphysical assault, humiliation, harassment and mental torture.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"104047\" id=\"span_33\">In <a href=\"/doc/104047/\" id=\"a_110\">Satpal vs.\n\nState of Haryana</a> (supra), this Court held that even though the prosecution\n\nevidence was not sufficient to establish charge under Section 304 or 306\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">\f                                                                                23</span>\n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_111\">IPC</a>, conviction under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_112\">Section 498A</a> IPC can be upheld because the\n\ndeceased was treated with cruelty by the appellant.</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_63\">24.
