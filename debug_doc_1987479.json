It is an erroneous view that the Magistrate\n      taking cognizance of an offence must necessarily\n      have territorial jurisdiction to try the case as well.\n      Chapter XIII of the Code relates to jurisdiction of\n      the criminal courts in enquiries and trials. That\n      chapter contains provisions regarding the place\n      where the enquiry and trial are to take place.\n      Section 177 says that:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">           &quot;177. Every offence shall ordinarily be\n           inquired into and tried by a Court\n           within whose local jurisdiction it was\n           committed&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_22\">      As is submitted under Section 179 which states\n      that, when an act is an offence by reason of\n      anything which has been done and of a\n      consequence which has ensued, the place of\n      enquiry and trial can as well be in a court within\n      whose local jurisdiction such thing has been done\n      or such consequence has ensued. It cannot be\n      overlooked that the said provisions do not\n      trammel the powers of any court to take\n      cognizance of the offence. Power of the court to\n      take cognizance of the offence is laid in Section\n      190 of the Code. Sub-sections (1) &amp; (2) read thus:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">              &quot;(i) Subject to the provisions of this\n              Chapter, any Magistrate of the first\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">      Crl.Rev No.170/2010                      Page 9 of 43</span>\n              class, and any Magistrate of the\n             second class specially empowered in\n             this behalf under sub-section (2), may\n             take cognizance of any offence\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">             (a) Upon receiving a complaint of facts\n             which constitute such offence;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">             (b) Upon a police report of such facts;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">             (c) Upon information received from\n             any person other than a police officer,\n             or upon his own knowledge, that such\n             offence has been committed.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">      (2) The Chief Judicial Magistrate may\n      empower any Magistrate of the second class\n      to take cognizance under sub-section (1) of\n      such offences as are within his competence\n      to inquire into or try.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_23\">13.          Further, it is submitted that Section 193 imposes\n\na restriction on the court of sessions to take cognizance of\n\nany offence as a court of original jurisdiction. But any\n\nMagistrate of First Class has the power to take cognizance of\n\nany offence, no matter that the offence was committed\n\nwithin his jurisdiction or not.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_24\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_25\">14.          It is stated, the only restriction contained in\n\nSection 190 is that the power to take cognizance is subject\n\nto the provisions of this Chapter. There are 9 Sections in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">      Crl.Rev No.170/2010                       Page 10 of 43</span>\n Chapter XIV most of which contain one or other restriction\n\nimposed on the power of a first class magistrate in taking\n\ncognizance of an offence. But none of them incorporates any\n\ncurtailment on such powers in relation to territorial barrier.\n\nIn the corresponding provision in the old <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_18\">Code of Criminal\n\nProcedure</a> (1898) the commencing words were like these:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">Except as hereinafter provided. Those words are now\n\nreplaced by Subject to the provisions of this chapter.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">Therefore, when there is nothing in Chapter XIV of the Code\n\nto impair the power of a judicial magistrate of first class\n\ntaking cognizance of the offence on the strength of any\n\nterritorial reason it is impermissible to deprive such a\n\nmagistrate of the power to take cognizance of an offence of\n\ncourse, in certain special enactments special provisions are\n\nincorporated for restricting the power of taking cognizance\n\nof offences falling under such acts. But such provisions are\n\nprotected by non-obstante clauses.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\">15.          Further        submits,   the   jurisdictional   aspect\n\nbecomes relevant only when the question of enquiry or a\n\ntrial arises. It is therefore, a fallacious thinking that only a\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">      Crl.Rev No.170/2010                           Page 11 of 43</span>\n magistrate having jurisdiction to try the case has the power\n\nto take cognizance of the offence. If he is a Magistrate of the\n\nFirst Class, his power to take cognizance of the offence is not\n\nimpaired by territorial restrictions. After taking cognizance\n\nhe may have to decide as to the court which has jurisdiction\n\nto enquire into or try the offence and that situation would\n\nreach only during the post cognizance stage and not earlier.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_27\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"418835\" id=\"span_23\">16.          According to the aforesaid judgment of the\n\nSupreme Court, in <a href=\"/doc/418835/\" id=\"a_19\">Trisums Chemical Industry</a> (supra) learned\n\nMagistrate taking cognizance of the offence must not\n\nnecessarily have a territorial jurisdiction to try the case.\n\nOnly when the inquiry or trial begins, does the territorial\n\naspect become relevant. In fact, after taking cognizance of\n\nthe offence, the Magistrate may have to decide as to which\n\ncourt would have the jurisdiction to enquire into the case as\n\nsuch a situation can arise only during the post-cognizance\n\nstage.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_28\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">17.

As discussed above, the Magistrate taking\n      cognizance of an offence must not necessarily\n      have the territorial jurisdiction to try the case as\n      well. Only when an enquiry or trial begins, does\n      the jurisdictional aspect become relevant. In fact,\n      after taking cognizance of the offence, the\n      Magistrate may have to decide as to which court\n      would have the jurisdiction to enquire into the\n      case and such a situation can arise only during\n      the post cognizance stage. At the pre-cognizance\n      stage, the Magistrate has only to examine the\n      averments, as set out in the complaint and not\n      more, for prima facie arriving at a decision as to\n      whether some of the acts essential for completing\n      an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 138</a> of the Act were\n      done in the territorial jurisdiction of that Court. In\n      the present case, having perused the complaint\n      filed by the petitioner/complainant without\n      ascertaining the correctness of the allegations\n      made therein, prima facie it has to be held that a\n      part of the cause of action has arisen in Delhi and\n      the same is not based solely on the issuance of a\n      legal notice by the petitioner/complainant to the\n      respondent/accused from Delhi, but some other\n      acts done prior thereto, as set out in para (3)\n      hereinabove.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_31\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\">18.

As     discussed     above,    the\n            Magistrate taking cognizance of an\n            offence must not necessarily have the\n            territorial jurisdiction to try the case as\n            well. Only when an enquiry or trial\n            begins, does the jurisdictional aspect\n            become relevant. In fact, after taking\n            cognizance of the offence, the\n            Magistrate may have to decide as to\n            which court would have the jurisdiction\n            to enquire into the case and such a\n            situation can arise only during the\n            post-cognizance stage. At the pre-\n            cognizance stage, the Magistrate has\n            only to examine the averments, as set\n            out in the complaint and not more, for\n            prima facie arriving at a decision as to\n            whether some of the acts essential for\n            completing an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_22\">Section\n            138</a> of the Act were done in the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">     Crl.Rev No.170/2010                          Page 14 of 43</span>\n              territorial jurisdiction of that Court.

Here, the service branch of the Drawee Bank\n\nat New Delhi has the access to the account of the drawer in\n\nview of interlinking of all the branches all over the country.\n\nIf the Collecting Bank has adopted the cheque truncation\n\nsystem then the cheque is scanned by the collecting bank\n\nand thereafter image of the cheque is transmitted to the\n\nclearing house of the Reserve Bank of India at New Delhi\n\nwhich sends the image of the cheque to the service branch\n\nof the Drawee Bank at New Delhi and if the drawer of the\n\ncheque has the requisite amount in its account it is cleared\n\nthere itself and if the account does not have the requisite\n\namount for honouring the cheque, the same is dishonoured.\n\nHere the service branch of the Drawee Bank at New Delhi\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">     Crl.Rev No.170/2010                      Page 28 of 43</span>\n has the access to the account of the drawer in view of inter-\n\nlinking of all the branches all over the country.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_81\">36.

The cheque\n\nwas dishonoured on presentation on account of insufficient\n\nfunds by the respondent/accused bank (Drawee Bank) at\n\nNew Delhi.

Only when an enquiry or\n\n          trial begins, does the jurisdictional aspect become\n\n          relevant.         In fact, after taking cognizance of the\n\n          offence, the Magistrate may have to decide as to\n\n          which court would have the jurisdiction to enquire\n\n          into the case and such a situation can arise only\n\n          during the post-cognizance stage.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">      2) At the pre-cognizance stage, the Magistrate has\n\n          only to examine the averments, as set out in the\n\n          complaint and not more, for prima facie arriving at\n\n          a decision as to whether some of the acts essential\n\n          for completing an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_117\">Section 138</a> of the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_101\">      Crl.Rev No.170/2010                          Page 39 of 43</span>\n             Act were done in the territorial jurisdiction of that\n\n            Court.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"529907\" id=\"span_102\">3) There appears no ambiguity on the aspect of the\n\n            right    of     the   petitioner/complainant   to   file    a\n\n            complaint in a Court having jurisdiction in the\n\n            context of the five acts mentioned in the case of\n\n            <a href=\"/doc/529907/\" id=\"a_118\">K.Bhaskaran</a> (supra).</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">      4) Learned Metropolitan Magistrates are precluded\n\n            from returning/dismissing the complaints In view of\n\n            the order dated 03.11.2009 passed by the Supreme\n\n            Court.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_121\">      In the present case, having perused the complaint filed\n\nby    the   petitioner/complainant        without   ascertaining       the\n\ncorrectness of the allegations made therein, prima facie it\n\nhas to be held that a part of the cause of action has arisen in\n\nDelhi and the same is based solely on the acts done as\n\nset out in para (22) hereinabove.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_122\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_123\">57.           <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"529907\" id=\"span_103\">In <a href=\"/doc/529907/\" id=\"a_119\">K.
