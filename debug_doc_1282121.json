This   appeal   arises   out   of   an   order   passed   by   the   High \n\n\nCourt of Kerala at Ernakulam, whereby Criminal M.C. no. 3715 \n\n\nof   2010   filed   under   Section   482   of   the   Code   of   Criminal  \n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                         1</span>\n\n\f\nProcedure,   1973,   with   a   prayer   for   quashing   criminal \n\n\nproceedings in FIR No.6/2010 alleging commission of offences \n\n\npunishable   under   <a href=\"/doc/203036/\" id=\"a_1\">Sections  354</a> and  <a href=\"/doc/764237/\" id=\"a_2\">394</a>  of  the  IPC,  has  been \n\n\ndismissed.     The   High   Court   has   taken   the   view   that   the \n\n\noffences   with   which   the   appellants   stand   charged,   are   not \n\n\n&#x27;personal   in   nature&#x27;   so   as   to   justify   quashing   the   pending \n\n\ncriminal  proceedings  on   the  basis of a  compromise  arrived  at \n\n\nbetween   the   first   informant-complainant   and   the   appellants. \n\n\nThe   only   question   that,   therefore,   arises   for   consideration   is \n\n\nwhether the criminal proceedings in question could be quashed \n\n\nin the facts and circumstances of the case having regard to the \n\n\nsettlement that the parties had arrived at.     \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">3.    Respondent-Radhika   filed   an   oral   complaint   in   the   Police \n\n\nStation at Nemom in the State of Kerala, stating that she had \n\n\naccompanied   her   husband   to   see   a   site   which   the   latter   had \n\n\nacquired at Punjakari. Upon arrival at the site, her husband and \n\n\nbrother Rajesh went inside the plot while she waited for them \n\n\nnear   the   car   parked   close   by.   Three   youngsters   at   this   stage \n\n\nappeared on a motorbike, one of whom snatched the purse and \n\n\nmobile   phone   from   her   hands   while   the   other   hit   her   on   the \n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                       2</span>\n\n\f\ncheek and hand. She raised an alarm that brought her husband \n\n\nand   brother   rushing   to   the   car   by   which   time   the   offenders \n\n\nescaped  towards  Karumam  on   a motorcycle.  The complainant \n\n\ngave   the   registration   number   of   the   motorbike   to   the   police \n\n\nand sought action against the appellants who were named by \n\n\nher   in   the   statement   made   before   the   Additional   Police   Sub-\n\n\nInspector   attached   to   the   Nemom   Police   Station.   FIR \n\n\nNo.6/2010   was,   on   the   basis   of   that   statement,   registered   in \n\n\nthe   police   station   and   investigation   started.   A   charge   sheet \n\n\nwas,   in   due   course,   filed   against   the   appellants   before   the \n\n\nJudicial   Magistrate   First   Class,   Neyyattinkara,   eventually \n\n\nnumbered CC 183/2010. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1442974\" id=\"span_3\">4.    During   the   pendency   of   the   criminal   proceedings \n\n\naforementioned,   the   parties   appear   to   have   amicably   settled \n\n\nthe matter among themselves. Criminal M.C. No.3715 of 2010 \n\n\nunder   <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_3\">Section   482</a>   Cr.P.C.   was   on   that   basis   filed   before   the \n\n\nHigh   Court   of   Kerala   at   Ernakulam   for   quashing   of   the \n\n\ncomplaint   pending   before   the   Judicial   Magistrate   First   Class, \n\n\nNeyyattinkara. That prayer was made primarily on the premise \n\n\nthat   appellant  No.1  Shiji   @  Pappu   who  also  owns  a   parcel   of \n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                       3</span>\n\n\f\nland   adjacent   to   the   property   purchased   by   the   respondent-\n\n\nRadhika, had some dispute in regard to the road leading to the \n\n\ntwo   properties.   An   altercation   had   in   that   connection   taken \n\n\nplace between the appellants on the one hand and the husband \n\n\nand brother of the respondent on the other, culminating in the \n\n\nregistration   of   the   FIR   mentioned   above.   The   petition   further \n\n\nstated   that   all   disputes   civil  and   criminal   between   the   parties \n\n\nhad   been   settled   amicably   and   that   the   respondent   had   no \n\n\ngrievance against the appellants in relation to the access to the \n\n\nplots in question and that the respondent had no objection to \n\n\nthe criminal proceedings against the appellants being quashed \n\n\nby the High  Court in exercise of its power  under  <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_4\">Section  482</a> \n\n\nCr.P.C.   The   petition   further   stated   that   the   disputes   between \n\n\nthe parties being personal in nature the same could be taken \n\n\nas settled and the proceedings put to an end relying upon the \n\n\ndecision   of   this   Court   in  <a href=\"/doc/1442974/\" id=\"a_5\">Madan   Mohan   Abbot   v.   State   of \n\n\nPunjab</a>   (2008)   4   SCC   582.     An   affidavit   sworn   by   the \n\n\nrespondent  stating  that  the matter  stood  settled  between  the \n\n\nparties was also filed by the appellants before the High Court.</span> \n\n\nThe   High   Court   has   upon   consideration   declined   the   prayer \n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                       4</span>\n\n\f\nmade by the appellants holding that the offences committed by \n\n\nthe   appellants   were   not   of   a   personal   nature   so   as   to   justify \n\n\nquashing   of   the   proceedings   in   exercise   of   its   extra-ordinary \n\n\njurisdiction under Section 482 Cr.P.C. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">5.    We   have   heard   learned   counsel   for   the   parties   and \n\n\nperused the impugned order. <a href=\"/doc/91933/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 320</a> of the Cr.P.C. enlists \n\n\noffences   that   are   compoundable   with   the   permission   of   the \n\n\nCourt before whom the prosecution is pending and those that \n\n\ncan be compounded even without such permission.  An offence \n\n\npunishable under <a href=\"/doc/203036/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 354</a> of the IPC is in terms of <a href=\"/doc/895891/\" id=\"a_8\">Section \n\n\n320(2)</a>   of   the   Code   compoundable   at   the   instance   of   the \n\n\nwoman against whom the offence is committed. To that extent, \n\n\ntherefore,   there   is   no   difficulty   in   either   quashing   the \n\n\nproceedings or compounding the offence under <a href=\"/doc/203036/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 354</a>, of \n\n\nwhich   the   appellants   are   accused,   having   regard   to   the   fact \n\n\nthat   the   alleged   victim   of   the   offence   has   settled   the   matter \n\n\nwith   the   alleged   assailants.     An   offence   punishable   under \n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/764237/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 394</a> IPC is not, however, compoundable with or without \n\n\nthe permission of the Court concerned. The question is whether \n\n\nthe   High   Court   could   and   ought   to   have   exercised   its   power \n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                         5</span>\n\n\f\nunder Section 482 Cr.P.C. for quashing the prosecution under \n\n\nthe   said   provision   in   the   light   of   the   compromise   that   the \n\n\nparties have arrived at. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_14\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1442974\" id=\"span_7\">6.    Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the first \n\n\ninformant-complainant   had,   in   the   affidavit   filed   before   this \n\n\nCourt,   clearly   admitted   that   the   complaint   in   question   was \n\n\nlodged   by   her   on   account   of   a   misunderstanding   and \n\n\nmisconception   about  the   facts  and   that   the   offences   of   which \n\n\nthe   appellants   stand   accused   are   purely   personal   in   nature \n\n\narising   out   of   personal   disputes   between   the   parties.     It   was \n\n\nalso evident that the complainant was no longer supporting the \n\n\nversion   on   which   the   prosecution   rested   its   case   against   the \n\n\nappellants.   According   to   the   learned   counsel   there   was   no \n\n\nquestion   of   the   Trial   Court   recording   a   conviction   against   the \n\n\nappellants in the light of what the complainant had stated on \n\n\naffidavit.   That   was   all   the   more   so,   when   the   other   two \n\n\nprosecution witnesses were none other than the husband and \n\n\nthe   brother   of   the   complainant   who   too   were   not   supporting \n\n\nthe   charges   against   the   appellants.   Such   being   the   case, \n\n\ncontinuance of criminal trial against the appellants was nothing \n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                       6</span>\n\n\f\nbut an abuse of the process of law and waste of valuable time \n\n\nof the Courts below. Exercise of power by the High Court under \n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. to prevent such abuse is perfectly justified, \n\n\ncontended the learned counsel. Reliance in support was placed \n\n\nby   the   learned   counsel   upon   the   decision   of   this   Court   in \n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1442974/\" id=\"a_12\">Madan Mohan Abbot</a>&#x27;s case (supra).</span> \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_15\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">7.    This Court has, in several decisions, declared that offences \n\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/91933/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 320</a> Cr.P.C. which are not compoundable with or \n\n\nwithout   the   permission   of   the   Court   cannot   be   allowed   to   be \n\n\ncompounded.  In Ram Lal and Anr. v. State of J &amp; K (1999) \n\n\n2 SCC 213, this Court referred to <a href=\"/doc/1058165/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 320(9)</a> of the Cr.P.C. \n\n\nto declare that such offences as are made compoundable under \n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/91933/\" id=\"a_15\">Section   320</a>   can   alone   be   compounded   and   none   else.     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"125131\" id=\"span_9\">This \n\n\nCourt   declared   two   earlier   decisions   rendered   in  <a href=\"/doc/125131/\" id=\"a_16\">Y.

What is important, however, is that \n\n\nin  Ram Lal&#x27;s case (supra) the parties had settled the dispute \n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                       7</span>\n\n\f\namong themselves after   the appellants stood convicted under \n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1540253/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 326</a> IPC.  The mutual settlement was then sought to be \n\n\nmade a basis for compounding of the offence in appeal arising \n\n\nout of the order of conviction and sentence imposed upon the \n\n\naccused. This Court observed that since the offence was non-\n\n\ncompoundable,   the   court   could   not   permit   the   same   to   be \n\n\ncompounded,   in   the   teeth   of   <a href=\"/doc/91933/\" id=\"a_19\">Section   320</a>.   Even   so,   the \n\n\ncompromise was taken  as an extenuating  circumstance which \n\n\nthe   court   took   into   consideration   to   reduce   the   punishment \n\n\nawarded to the appellant to the period already undergone.  To \n\n\nthe same effect is the decision of this Court in  Ishwar Singh \n\n\nv.   State   of   Madhya   Pradesh   (2008)   15   SCC   667;  where \n\n\nthis Court said:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">         &quot;14.

In  our   judgment,   however,  \n\n         limited   submission   of   the   learned   counsel   for   the  \n\n         appellant   deserves   consideration   that   while   imposing  \n\n         substantive   sentence,   the   factum   of   compromise  \n\n         between  the parties is indeed  a relevant circumstance  \n\n         which the Court may keep in mind.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"548497\" id=\"span_11\">8.

The   saving   of   the   High   Court&#x27;s   inherent  \n\n         powers, both in civil and criminal matters is designed to  \n\n         achieve a salutary public purpose which is that a court  \n\n         proceeding   ought   not   to   be   permitted   to   degenerate  \n\n         into   a   weapon   of   harassment   or   persecution.

The ends of justice are higher  \n\n         than the ends of mere law though justice has got to be  \n\n         administered according to laws made by the legislature.  \n\n         The compelling necessity for making these observations  \n\n         is   that   without   a   proper   realisation   of   the   object   and  \n\n         purpose   of   the   provision   which   seeks   to   save   the  \n\n         inherent   powers   of   the   High   Court   to   do   justice  \n\n         between   the   State   and   its   subjects   it   would   be  \n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                             9</span>\n\n\f\n             impossible to appreciate the width and contours of that  \n\n             salient jurisdiction.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">9.     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1738333\" id=\"span_14\">In      <a href=\"/doc/1738333/\" id=\"a_23\">Madhavrao   Jiwajirao   Scindia   and   Ors.   v. \n\n\nSambhajirao Chandrojirao Angre and Ors.</a> (1988) 1 SCC \n\n\n692,  this   Court   held   that   the   High   Court   should   take   into \n\n\naccount any special features which appear in a particular case \n\n\nto consider whether it is expedient and in the interest of justice \n\n\nto   permit   a   prosecution   to   continue   or   quash   the   prosecution \n\n\nwhere in its opinion the chances of an ultimate conviction are \n\n\nbleak.

It is also for the court to take into  \n\n             consideration   any   special   features   which   appear   in   a  \n\n             particular case to consider whether it is expedient and  \n\n             in   the   interest   of   justice   to   permit   a   prosecution   to  \n\n             continue.

It   was   a \n\n\ncase   which   has   its   origin   in   the   civil   dispute   between   the \n\n\nparties, which dispute has, it appears, been resolved by them. \n\n\nThat   being   so,   continuance   of   the   prosecution   where   the \n\n\ncomplainant is not ready to support the allegations which are \n\n\nnow described by her as arising out of some &quot;misunderstanding \n\n\nand misconception&quot; will be a futile exercise that will serve no \n\n\npurpose.   It is noteworthy that the two alleged eye witnesses, \n\n\nwho are closely related to the complainant, are also no longer \n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                                         16</span>\n\n\f\nsupportive  of  the  prosecution version. The continuance of the \n\n\nproceedings   is   thus   nothing   but   an   empty   formality.   <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_68\">Section \n\n\n482</a> Cr.P.C. could, in such circumstances, be justifiably invoked \n\n\nby the High Court to prevent abuse of the process of law and \n\n\nthereby preventing a wasteful exercise by the Courts below.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_32\">15.    We accordingly allow this appeal, set aside the impugned \n\n\norder passed by the High Court and quash the prosecution in \n\n\nCC 183/2010 pending in the Court of Judicial Magistrate, First \n\n\nClass, Neyyattinkara.                      \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_33\">\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_34\">                                               ...................................J.\n\n                                               (CYRIAC JOSEPH)\n\n\n\n\n\n                                               ...................................J.\n\nNew Delhi                                      (T.S.
