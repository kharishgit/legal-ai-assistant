PAUL, J.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_2\">Leave granted.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_3\">This appeal is by the accused in Complaint Case No. 1388 of 1997 in the\nCourt of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Patna, aggrieved by the order dated\n20.12.2000 passed by the High Court of Patna in Criminal Misc. No. 6232 of\n1998.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">In brief the facts to the extent relevant and necessary for disposal of\nthis appeal are as under :-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">There was an agreement dated 21.2.1995 between the appellant No. 1 (the\ncompany) and the respondent no. 2 under which he was appointed as a\nconsignment stockist of the company subject to certain terms and\nconditions.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">The said agreement was valid till 20.2.1996. By a subsequent agreement\ndated S.S.1997 the same arrangement was extended up to 31.3.1997 on the\nsame terms and conditions. On 3.10.1997 respondent No. 2 (complainant)\nserved a notice on the Manager Marketing and Regional Manager of the\ncompany requesting them to make payment of Rs. 15.00 lacs to it within 15\ndays or in the alternative refer the disputes and differences to\narbitration as per clause 29 of the agreement. Thereafter the parties met\nand the company offered to supply Ammonium Sulphate to the respondent for\nthe period 1997-98 on certain terms. The respondent rejected the offer\nfinding the terms unreasonable. It is thereafter the respondent filed a\ncomplaint on 8.12.1997 alleging offences under sections 406 and 420 read\nwith <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 120B</a> of the Indian Penal Code (<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_2\">IPC</a>) inter alia stating &quot;that\nthe accused persons in collusion and connivance of each other with wrongful\nobjects and motive to wrongfully squeeze money/ gratification from the\ncomplainant and in their own benefit used the complain-ant wrongly and have\ncheated the complainant by practising fraud and have acted fraudulently\nagainst the complainant and by doing such acts they have committed criminal\nbreach of trust and put the complainant to wrongful loss and have gained\nwrongfully. The accused persons have also cheated the com-plainant by using\nthe office and godown premises of the complainant on the basis of false\nassurances given to the complainant and without making any farthing for\nsuch costly and valuable premises and thus committed criminal breach of\ntrust, fraud and cheating which caused loss of rupees fifteen lacs&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">The learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Patna by his order dated 6.1.1998\nissued summons against the appellants. The appellants approached the High\nCourt by filing a petition under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. for quashing the\naforemen-tioned order of the learned Magistrate. The High Court by the\nimpugned order dismissed the said petition. In these circumstances the\nappellants are before this Court in appeal.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">Shri Dushyant Dave, learned Senior Counsel for the appellants urged that\nthe High Court failed to exercise its power under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C.\nhaving regard to the facts and circumstances of the case in order to\nprevent abuse of process of the court and/or to secure the ends of justice;\nthat the disputes between the appellants and respondent no. 2 were purely\nof civil nature arising out of contractual relationship relating to\ncommercial transac-tion; even looking to the sworn statements, terms of the\nagreement and the notice dated 3.10.1997, no case is made out to proceed\nagainst the appellants on criminal side, that the essential ingredient of\nthe offence under <a href=\"/doc/1249173/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 405</a> IPC is not made out as the appellants were\nnot entrusted with any property or with domain over property; similarly the\ningredients of the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1306824/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 415</a> &amp; <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_7\">120-B</a> IPC also were not\nsatisfied. According to him, the learned Magistrate committed a serious\nerror in issuing the process; unfortunately, the High Court, also failed to\ncorrect the same, exercising jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 482</a> of the Cr.P.C.\nAlternatively and lastly, he submitted that at any rate no case is made out\nagainst the appellants 1-6 and 8. Hence, issuing a process against them is\npatently illegal and untenable. Shri L.K. Bajla, learned counsel for\nrespondent No. 2 made submissions supporting the impugned judgment of the\nHigh Court and justifying the order passed by the learned Magistrate in\nissuing the process. More or less, he reiterated the submissions that were\nmade before the High Court.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">Before examining respective contentions on their relative merits, we think\nit is appropriate to notice the legal position. Every breach of trust may\nnot result in a penal offence of criminal breach of trust unless there is\nevidence of a mental act of fraudulent misappropriation. An act of breach\nof trust involves a civil wrong in respect of which the person wronged may\nseek his redress for damages in a civil court but a breach of trust with\nmens rea gives rise to a criminal prosecution as well.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">The ingredients in order to constitute a criminal breach of trust are: (1)\nentrusting a person with property or with any dominion over property (ii)\nthat person entrusted (a) dishonestly misappropriating or converting that\nproperty to his own use; or (b) dishonestly using or disposing of that\nproperty or willfully suffering any other person so to do in violation (i)\nof any direction of law prescribing the mode in which such trust is to be\ndischarged (ii) of any legal contract made touching the discharge of such\ntrust.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">The ingredients of the offence of cheating are: (i) there should be\nfraudulent or dishonest inducement of a person by deceiving him, (ii) (a)\nthe person so deceived should be induced to deliver any property to any\nperson, or to consent that any person shall retain any property; or (b) the\nperson so deceived should be intentionally induced to do or omit to do\nanything which he would not do or omit if he were not so deceived; and\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">(iii) in cases covered by (ii) (b), the act of omission should be one which\ncauses or is likely to cause damage or harm .to the person induced in body,\nmind, reputation or property.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_5\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"853800\" id=\"span_1\">One of us (D.P. Mohapatra J.) speaking for the Bench, in <a href=\"/doc/853800/\" id=\"a_9\">Hridaya Ranjan\nPrasad Verma &amp; Ors. v. State of Bihar &amp; Anr</a>, [2000] 4 SCC 168, on facts of\nthat case, has expressed thus :</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">&quot;In determining the question it has to be kept in mind that the distinc-\ntion between mere breach of contract and the offence of cheating is a fine\none. It depends upon the intention of the accused at the time of inducement\nwhich may be judged by his subsequent conduct but for this subsequent\nconduct is not the sole test. Mere breach of contract cannot give rise to\ncriminal prosecution for cheating unless fraudulent or dishonest intention\nis shown right at the beginning of the transac-tion, that is the time when\nthe offence is said to have been committed. Therefore it is the intention\nwhich is the gist of the offence. To hold a person guilty of cheating it is\nnecessary to show that he had fraudu-lent or dishonest intention at the\ntime of making the promise. From his mere failure to keep up promise\nsubsequently such a culpable intention right at the beginning, that is,\nwhen he made the promise cannot be presumed.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\">[emphasis supplied]\n\nFinding that ingredients of the offence of cheating and its allied offences\nhad not been made out, this Court interfered with the order of the High\nCourt and quashed the criminal proceedings.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_7\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"169522737\" id=\"span_2\">In <a href=\"/doc/169522737/\" id=\"a_10\">G.V.

That is to say, in the\nfirst part, inducement must be dishonest or fraudulent. In the second part,\nthe inducement should be intentional. As observed by this Court in\n<a href=\"/doc/1273982/\" id=\"a_12\">Jaswantrai Manilal Akhaney v.

Such examination is provided in order to find out\nwhether there is or not sufficient ground for proceeding. The words\n&#x27;sufficient ground&#x27;, used under <a href=\"/doc/1096902/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 203</a> have to be construed to mean\nthe satisfaction that a prima facie case is made out against the accused\nand not sufficient ground for the purpose of conviction.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1379027\" id=\"span_6\">This Court in <a href=\"/doc/1379027/\" id=\"a_19\">Nirmaljit Singh Hoon v.

P.C. has explained that &quot;The section does not say that a regular trial\nof adjudging truth or otherwise of the person complained against should\ntake place at that stage, for, such a person can be called upon to answer\nthe accusation made against him only when a process has been issued and he\nis on trial. <a href=\"/doc/1096902/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 203</a> consists of two parts.

It is\nalso indicated by way of illustration in which cases an order of the\nMagistrate issuing process can be quashed on such case being &quot;where the\nallegations made in the complaint or the statements of the witnesses\nrecorded in support of the same taken at their face value make out\nabsolutely no case against the accused or the complaint does not disclose\nthe essential ingredients of an offence which is alleged against the\naccused&quot;.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"49712\" id=\"span_9\">Cautioning against issuing of process so that it should not be an instru-\nment in the hands of the private complainant as vendetta to harass the\nperson needlessly, this Court in <a href=\"/doc/49712/\" id=\"a_25\">Punjab National Bank &amp; Ors. v. Surendra\nPrasad Sinha</a>, [1993] Supp. (1) SCC 499 has this to say in para 6 :-</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1738333\" id=\"span_10\">&quot;It is also salutary to note that judicial process should not be an\ninstrument of oppression or needless harassment. The complaint was laid\nimpleading the Chairman, the Managing Director of the Bank by name and a\nhost of officers. There lies responsibility and duty on the magistracy to\nfind whether the concerned accused should be legally responsible for the\noffence charged for. Only on satisfying that the law casts liability or\ncreates offence against the juristic person or the persons impleaded then\nonly process would be issued. At that stage the court would be circumspect\nand judicious in exercising discretion and should take all the relevant\nfacts and circumstances into consideration before issuing process lest it\nwould be an instrument in the hands of the private complaint as vendetta to\nharass the persons needlessly. Vindication of majesty of justice and\nmaintenance of law and order in the society are the prime objects of\ncriminal justice but it would not be the means to wreak personal vengeance.\nConsidered from any angle we find that the respondent had abused the\nprocess and laid complaint &quot;against the appellants without any prima facie\ncase to harass them from vendetta.&quot; Similarly in <a href=\"/doc/1738333/\" id=\"a_26\">Madhavrao Jiwajirao\nScindia &amp; Ors. v. Sambhajirao\n\nChandrojirao Angre &amp; Ors.</a>, [1988] 1 SCC 692, this Court has stated that\n&quot;The legal position is well settled that when a prosecution at the initial\nstage is asked to be quashed, the test to be applied by the court is as to\nwhether the uncontroverted allegations as made prima facie establish the\noffence. It is also for the court to take into consideration  any  special\nfeatures which appear in a particular case to consider whether it is\nexpedient and in the interest of justice to permit a prosecution to\ncontinue. This is so on the basis that the court cannot be utilized for any\noblique purpose and where in the opinion of the court chances of an\nultimate conviction is bleak and, therefore, no useful          purpose is\nlikely to be served by allowing a criminal prosecution to continue, the\ncourt may while taking into consideration the special facts of a case also\nquash the proceeding even though it may be at a preliminary stage.&quot;</span>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_12\">Turning to the facts of the case, there is nothing either in the complaint\nand/or in the sworn statements of the complainant and the three witnesses\nthat any property was entrusted to any of the appellants at all or the\nappellants had domain over any of the properties of respondent no. 2 which\nthey dishonestly converted to their own use so as to satisfy the\ningredients of <a href=\"/doc/1249173/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 405</a> IPC punishable under <a href=\"/doc/988620/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 406</a> IPC. Further\nthe agreement also did not require entrustment of any property to the\nappellants. Taking the complaint and the statements of the witnesses as\nthey are, it cannot be said even prima facie, that the appellants committed\nany offence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/988620/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 406</a> IPC, since the ingredients of that\noffence were not satisfied. Hence the learned Magistrate committed a\nserious error in issuing process against the appellants for the said\noffence. Unfortunately, the High Court also failed to correct this manifest\nerror. It is clear from the allegations made in the complaint and the sworn\nstatements that the appellant no. 1 company entered into an agreement with\nthe respondent no. 2 on certain terms and conditions. It is alleged that\nthe appellant no. 7 went to Patna and contracted respondent no. 2 and\ninduced him to enter into an agreement assuring him of huge profit. At the\ntime of arriving at such an agreement, none of the other appellants either\nmet the respondent no. 2 or induced him to enter into any agreement with a\nview to cheat him. The agreement was further renewed for a period of one\nyear. It is not the case that there was no supply of goods at all as it has\ncome on record that there was supply of 400 ton of fertilizer, may be it\nwas far less than the required quantity. The allegations made against the\nappellants other than the appellant no. 7 are very vague and bald. From the\nmaterial that was placed before the Magistrate, even prima facie, it cannot\nbe said that there was conspiracy or connivance between the other\nappellants and the appellant No. 7. If the appellants have committed breach\nof agreement, it is open to respondent no. 2 to seek redressal in a\ncompetent court or forum to recover damages, if permissible in law in case\nhe had sustained any loss. In order to constitute an offence of cheating,\nthe intention to deceive should be in existence at the time when the\ninducement was made. It is necessary to show that a person had fraudulent\nor dishonest intention at the time of making the promise, to say that he\ncommitted an act of cheating. A mere failure to keep up promise\nsubsequently cannot be pre-sumed as an act leading to cheating.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">Looking to the complaint and the grievances made by the complainant therein\nand having regard to the agreement, it is clear that the dispute and\ngrievances arise out of the said agreement. Clause 29 of the agreement\nprovides for reference to arbitration in case of disputes or controversy\nbetween the parties and the said clause is wide enough to cover almost all\nsorts of disputes arising out of the agreement. As a matter of fact, it is\nalso brough to our notice that the complainant issued a notice dated\n3.10.1997 to the appellants invoking this arbitration clause claiming Rs.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">15. lacs. It is thereafter the present complaint was filed. For the alleged\nbreach of the agreement in relation to commercial transaction, it is open\nto the respondent no. 2 to proceed against the appellants for his redressal\nfor recovery of money by way of damages for the loss caused, if any. Merely\nbecause there is an arbitration clause in the agreement, that cannot\nprevent criminal prosecution against the accused if an act constituting a\ncriminal offence is made out even prime facie.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">Many a times, complaints are filed under <a href=\"/doc/444619/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 200</a> Cr.P.C. by the parties\nwith an oblique motive or for collateral purposes to harass, to wreck\nvengeance, pressurize the accused to bring them to their own terms or to\nenforce the obligations arising out of breach of contract touching\ncommercial transactions instead of approaching civil courts with a view to\nrealize money at the earliest. It is also to be kept in mind that when\nparties commit a wrongful act constituting a criminal offence satisfying\nnecessary ingredients of an offence, they cannot be allowed to walk away\nwith an impression that no action could be taken against them on criminal\nside. A wrongful or illegal act such as criminal breach of trust,\nmisappropriation, cheating or defamation may give rise to action both on\ncivil as well as on criminal side when it is clear from the complaint and\nsworn statements that necessary ingredients of constituting an offence are\nmade out. May be parties are entitled to proceed on civil side only in a\ngiven situation in the absence of an act constituting an offence but not to\nproceed against the accused in a criminal prosecution. Hence before issuing\na process a Magistrate has to essentially keep in mind the scheme contained\nin the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 200-203</a> of Cr.P.C. keeping in mind the\nposition of law stated above and pass an order judiciously and not\nmechanically or in routine manner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">The learned Magistrate, in our view, having regard to the facts stated and\nthe legal position explained above, committed a serious error in issuing\nthe process against the appellants 1 to 6 and 8 for offences under <a href=\"/doc/988620/\" id=\"a_32\">Sections\n406</a>,<a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_33\">420</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_34\">120-B</a> IPC when the acts alleged against them did not constitute\nthese offences satisfying their ingredients even prima facie. In the light\nof the material brought on record at that stage process could have been\nissued only as against the appellant no. 7 that too for an offence under\n<a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 420</a> IPC only.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"511635\" id=\"span_11\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"418835\" id=\"span_12\">The High Court dismissed the petition filed under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. by\nthe impugned order placing reliance, in particular, on two decisions of\nthis Court, one <a href=\"/doc/418835/\" id=\"a_37\">Trisuns Chemical Industry</a> (supra) and <a href=\"/doc/511635/\" id=\"a_38\">Medchi Chemicals &amp;\nPharma (P) Ltd. v.

Further it was held that referring the\ndisputes to arbitration is not an effective substitute for a criminal\nprosecution when the disputed act is an offence. It may be noted that <a href=\"/doc/511635/\" id=\"a_39\">the\nsaid judgment</a> gets attracted only when the disputed act is an offence,\nwhich the High Court has filed to notice. No doubt, exercise of inherent\npower under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. by High Court should be limited to very\nextreme exceptions but in a case where ingredients of alleged offences are\nnot satisfied even prima facie, it cannot be said that power under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_41\">Section\n482</a> Cr.P.C. should not be exercised to quash the process issued by a\nMagistrate.</span></span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"56823\" id=\"span_13\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/56823/\" id=\"a_42\">Smt. Nagawwa</a> (supra), it is laid down that in\nsuch a case, power under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_43\">section 482</a> Cr.P.C. can be exercised to quash the\nprocess issued by a Magistrate.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_18\">In the second case also, this Court has expressed that &quot;exercise of\njurisdiction under the inherent power as envisaged under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 482</a>\nCr.P.C. to have the complaint or the charge-sheet quashed is an exception\nrather than a rule and the case for quashing at the initial stage must have\nto be treated as rarest of rare so as not to scuttle the\nprosecution....................In the event, however, the court on perusal\nof the complaint comes to a conclusion that the allegations leveled in the\ncomplaint or charge-sheet on the face of it does not constitute or disclose\nany offence as alleged, there ought not to be any hesi-tation to rise up to\nthe expectation of the people and deal with the situation as is required\nunder the law.&quot; Even from this case also, it is clear that if no offence is\nmade out from the allegations made in the complaint, there should be no\nhesitation in exercising power under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. to pass\nappropriate order.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_19\">In the case on hand, we have already stated above that except against the\nappellant no. 7, no offence was made out against the remaining appellants\nas the ingredients of offences alleged against them were not satisfied.\nUnfortu-nately, the High Court failed to exercise jurisdiction under\n<a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. to correct manifest error committed by the learned\nMagistrate in issuing proc-ess against the appellants 1-6 and 8 when the\nalleged acts against them did not constitute offences for want of\nsatisfying the ingredients of the offences. The approach and considerations\nwhile exercising power and jurisdiction by a Magistrate at the time of\nissuing process are to be in terms of <a href=\"/doc/444619/\" id=\"a_47\">Sections 200</a> to <a href=\"/doc/443138/\" id=\"a_48\">203</a> under Chapter XV\nof <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_49\">Cr.P.C</a>., having due regard to the position of law explained in various\ndecisions of this Court, and whereas while exercising power under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_50\">Section\n482</a> of Cr.P.C. the High Court has to look at the object and purpose for\nwhich such power is conferred on it under the said provision. Exercise of\ninherent power is available to the High Court to give effect to any order\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_51\">Cr.P.C</a>., or to prevent about of the process of any court or\notherwise to secure the ends of justice. This being the position, exercise\nof power under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. should be consistent with the scope and\nambit of the same in the light of the decisions aforementioned. In\nappropriate cases, to prevent judicial process from being an instrument of\noppression or harass-ment in the hands of frustrated or vindictive\nlitigants, exercise of inherent power is not only desirable but necessary\nalso, so that the judicial forum of court may not be allowed to be utilized\nfor any oblique motive. When a person approaches the High Court under\n<a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_53\">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. to quash the very issue of process, the High Court on\nthe facts and circumstances of a case has to exercise the powers with\ncircumspection as stated above to really serve the purpose and object for\nwhich they are conferred.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_20\">Thus having regard to facts and circumstances stated and discussion made\nabove, the issue of process against appellant nos. 1-6 and 8 is set aside\nand the process issued against appellant no. 7 namely, Amrit Lal Desai @\nA.B. Desai for offences under <a href=\"/doc/664789/\" id=\"a_54\">Sections 406</a> and 120-B is also set aside.\nHowever, the issue of process against him under <a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 420</a> IPC is\nmaintained. The order of the learned Magistrate and the impugned order are\nmodified to this extent. Thus, this appeal is partly allowed and stands\ndisposed of in the above terms.\n</p>\n\n\n\n",
