According to the prosecution version, on 8.1.1997 in the\n\nmorning, deceased Hazoor Singh had borrowed the tractor of\n\nLal Singh and tiller of Gurbachan Singh. Gurmej Singh P.W.5,\n\nson of Hazoor Singh (deceased) was going along with Lal Singh\n\nto return the tractor at the Dera of Gurbachan Singh. On the\n\nway,    accused   Gurmukh     Singh,   son   of   Dayal   Singh,\n\naccompanied by the co-accused Niranjan Singh, Harbhajan\n\nSingh and Manjit Singh armed with lathis, whose Dera was\n\nnearby came and stopped the tractor. The appellant raised a\n\nlalkara that Hazoor Singh and his son should not be allowed\n\nto pass through the passage of which there was a dispute\n\nbetween the parties.    Hazoor Singh was following the tractor.\n\nHe advised the appellant to desist from stopping the tractor on\n\nwhich the appellant gave a lathi blow on the head of the\n\ndeceased Hazoor Singh rendering him unconscious, resulting\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">\f                                                          3</span>\n\nin his fall on the ground. Jagtar Singh, P.W.4 brother of the\n\ndeceased, witnessed the incident and reached the spot.\n\nGurdip Singh and Puran Singh also reached there.        Jagtar\n\nSingh had caught Gurmukh Singh. In the process, Gurmej\n\nSingh P.W.5 was also given lathi blow by Niranjan Singh.\n\nGurmej Singh also caused injuries to Harbhajan Singh and\n\nNiranjan Singh. The deceased was taken to the hospital and\n\non receiving the message, the Assistant Sub-Inspector of Police\n\nJagdish Chander reached there and recorded the statement of\n\nJagtar Singh at 7.15 p.m., leading to the registration of the\n\nFirst Information Report. He went to the place of occurrence,\n\nprepared rough site plan and took other steps of investigation.\n\nInjured Hazoor Singh was removed to PGI Hospital at\n\nChandigarh, where he died on 14.1.1997 after three days on\n\naccount of the head injury sustained by him.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">5.   The prosecution examined Dr. Rajinder Kumar P.W.1\n\nwho examined Hazoor Singh at 4.55 p.m. on 8.1.1997 and\n\nreferred him to the Civil Hospital, Karnal,    Dr. R. M.

Dr. Rajinder Kumar P.W.1 who examined the deceased\n\nfound the following head injury:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">     &quot;Depression of skull bone at both parietal region at\n     top, swelling both parietal region whole.        No\n     abrasion, no bruise visible. Advise X-ray skull A.P.\n     lateral and obliquely.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\">7.   According to the Doctor, the cause of death of the\n\ndeceased was the head injury sustained by him, which was\n\nsufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\">8.   It may be pertinent to mention here that the appellant\n\nGurmukh Singh was accompanied by co-accused Niranjan\n\nSingh, Harbhajan Singh and Manjit Singh.            Except the\n\nappellant Gurmukh Singh, all other accused were acquitted by\n\nthe trial court, whereas the appellant Gurmukh Singh was\n\nconvicted under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_1\">section 302</a> of the Indian Penal Code and\n\nsentenced to imprisonment for life and a fine of Rs.1,000/-, in\n\ndefault of payment of which, to further under rigorous\n\nimprisonment for six months.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">\f                                                             5</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_13\">9.    The High Court in the impugned judgment has upheld\n\nthe judgment of the trial court and maintained the conviction\n\nand sentence awarded to the appellant Gurmukh Singh.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">10.   The appellant aggrieved by the judgment of the High\n\nCourt preferred this appeal. We have carefully perused the\n\njudgments of the trial court and the High Court as also the\n\nevidence of witnesses. It is fully established from the evidence\n\non record that the appellant had caused the injury to the\n\ndeceased Hazoor Singh which proved fatal.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_15\">11.   The short question which falls for consideration of this\n\ncourt is whether, on consideration of the peculiar facts and\n\ncircumstances of the case, the conviction of the appellant\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_2\">section 302</a> IPC should be upheld or the conviction be\n\nconverted to one under <a href=\"/doc/409589/\" id=\"a_3\">section 304</a> Part II <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_4\">IPC</a>? Appropriate\n\nsentencing is a very vital function and obligation of the court.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_16\">12.   There are significant features of the case which are\n\nrequired to be taken into consideration in awarding the\n\nappropriate sentence to the accused:\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">\f                                                           6</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_17\">\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">(1)   Admittedly, the incident happened at the spur of the\n\n      moment;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">(2)   It is clear from the evidence on record that the appellant\n\n      was not using that path everyday.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">(3)   The appellant gave a single lathi blow on the head of the\n\n      deceased which proved fatal;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">(4)   The other accused did not indulge in overt act therefore,\n\n      except the appellant, the other co-accused namely\n\n      Niranjan Singh, Harbhajan Singh and Manjit Singh have\n\n      been acquitted by the trial court;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">(5)   The incident took place on 8.1.1997 and the deceased\n\n      remained hospitalized and ultimately died on 14.1.1997;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">(6)   The trial court observed that there was no previous\n\n      enmity between the parties.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_18\">Therefore, it is abundantly clear that there was no pre-\n\narranged plan or that the incident had taken place in\n\nfurtherance of the common intention of the accused persons.\n\nWhen all these facts and circumstances are taken into\n\nconsideration in proper perspective, then it becomes difficult\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">\f                                                               7</span>\n\nto maintain the conviction of the appellant under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_5\">section 302</a>\n\nIPC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_19\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_20\">13.    <a href=\"/doc/409589/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 304</a> IPC reads as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">       &quot;304.

State of Haryana</a> (1981) 3 SCC\n\n616, the accused had inflicted a single blow in the heat of\n\nmoment in a sudden fight with blunt side of Gandhala on the\n\nhead of the deceased causing his death.        According to the\n\nopinion of the doctor this particular injury was sufficient in\n\nthe ordinary course of nature to cause death.     But, according\n\nto this Court, the intention to cause such an injury was likely\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">\f                                                          8</span>\n\nto cause death had not been made out.       This Court altered\n\nthe conviction of the accused from <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_8\">section 302</a> IPC to <a href=\"/doc/409589/\" id=\"a_9\">section\n\n304</a> Part II <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_10\">IPC</a> and the accused was directed to suffer rigorous\n\nimprisonment for a period of seven years.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_23\">15.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1035472\" id=\"span_9\">In <a href=\"/doc/1035472/\" id=\"a_11\">Gurmail Singh &amp; Others v.

The injury was an incised\n\nwound.    The Sessions Judge convicted the accused under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_12\">section 302</a> IPC and sentenced him to rigorous imprisonment\n\nfor life. The High Court affirmed the same. This Court, while\n\ntaking into consideration the age of the accused and other\n\ncircumstances, converted the conviction from <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_13\">section 302</a> IPC\n\nto one under <a href=\"/doc/409589/\" id=\"a_14\">section 304</a> Part II <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_15\">IPC</a> and sentenced him to\n\nsuffer rigorous imprisonment for five years and a fine of\n\nRs.500/-, in default to suffer rigorous imprisonment for six\n\nmonths.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">16.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"557758\" id=\"span_10\">In <a href=\"/doc/557758/\" id=\"a_16\">Kulwant Rai v.

This Court observed that since there was\n\nno pre-meditation, Part 3 of <a href=\"/doc/626019/\" id=\"a_17\">section 300</a> of the Indian Penal\n\nCode could not be attracted because it cannot be said that the\n\naccused intended to inflict that particular injury which was\n\nultimately found to have been inflicted.         In the facts and\n\ncircumstances of that case, the conviction of the accused was\n\naltered from <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_18\">section 302</a> to that under <a href=\"/doc/409589/\" id=\"a_19\">section 304</a> Part II <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_20\">IPC</a>\n\nand    the   accused     was   sentenced    to    suffer   rigorous\n\nimprisonment for five years.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\">17.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"457136\" id=\"span_12\">In <a href=\"/doc/457136/\" id=\"a_21\">Jagtar Singh v.

The\n\ndoctor opined that the injury was sufficient in the ordinary\n\ncourse of nature to cause death. This Court observed that the\n\nquarrel was of a trivial nature and even in such a trivial\n\nquarrel the appellant wielded a weapon like a knife and landed\n\na blow in the chest. In these circumstances, it is a permissible\n\ninference that the appellant at least could be imputed with a\n\nknowledge that he was likely to cause an injury which was\n\nlikely to cause death.

The occurrence\n\nadmittedly had taken place in the spur of the moment and in\n\nheat of passion upon a sudden quarrel.          According to the\n\ndoctor the injury was sufficient in the ordinary course of\n\nnature to cause death.

As the\n      totality of the established facts and circumstances\n      do show that the occurrence had happened most\n      unexpectedly in a sudden quarrel and without pre-\n      meditation during the course of which the appellant\n      caused a solitary injury, he could not be imputed\n      with the intention to cause death of the deceased or\n      with the intention to cause that particular fatal\n      injury; but he could be imputed with the knowledge\n      that he was likely to cause an injury which was\n      likely to cause death. Because in the absence of any\n      positive proof that the appellant caused the death of\n      the deceased with the intention of causing death or\n      intentionally inflicted that particular injury which in\n      the ordinary course of nature was sufficient to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">\f                                                             11</span>\n\n      cause death, neither Clause I nor Clause III of\n      <a href=\"/doc/626019/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 300</a> IPC will be attracted......&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_30\">This Court while setting aside the conviction under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_27\">section 302</a> convicted the accused under <a href=\"/doc/409589/\" id=\"a_28\">section 304</a> Part\n\nII and sentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment\n\nfor seven years.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\">19.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1883491\" id=\"span_16\">In <a href=\"/doc/1883491/\" id=\"a_29\">Abani K.Debnath &amp; Another v.

The\n      prosecution evidence clearly discloses that the dao\n      blow dealt by A-1 is preceded by a mutual quarrel.\n      We have already noted that there was no common\n      intention to kill Ranjit Das. From the nature of\n      injuries it is disclosed that A-1 dealt only one dao\n      blow perhaps in the spur of moment. The incident\n      had taken place on 10.8.1990 and the deceased\n      succumbed to injury on 15.8.1990 after a lapse of 7\n      days.

Heat of passion requires that\n      there must be no time for the passions to cool down\n      and in this case, the parties have worked\n      themselves into a fury on account of the verbal\n      altercation in the beginning. A fight is a combat\n      between two and more persons whether with or\n      without weapons. It is not possible to enunciate any\n      general rule as to what shall be deemed to be a\n      sudden quarrel. It is a question of fact and whether\n      a quarrel is sudden or not must necessarily depend\n      upon the proved facts of each case. For the\n      application of Exception 4, it is not sufficient to\n      show that there was a sudden quarrel and there\n      was no premeditation. It must further be shown\n      that the offender has not taken undue advantage or\n      acted in cruel or unusual manner. The expression\n      &#x27;undue advantage&#x27; as used in the provision means\n      &#x27;unfair advantage&#x27;.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">\f                                                              13</span>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">           It cannot be laid down as a rule of universal\n      application that whenever one blow is given, <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_42\">Section\n      302</a> IPC is ruled out. It would depend upon the\n      weapon used, the size of it in some cases, force with\n      which the blow was given, part of the body it was\n      given and several such relevant factors.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">            Considering the factual background in the\n      case at hand it will be appropriate to convict the\n      appellant under <a href=\"/doc/409589/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 304</a> Part II <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_44\">IPC</a>, instead of\n      <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 302</a> IPC as has been done by the trial court\n      and affirmed by the High Court. Custodial sentence\n      of eight years would meet the ends of justice.

In the instant case, the occurrence had taken place at\n\nthe spur of the moment. Only the appellant Gurmukh Singh\n\ninflicted a single lathi blow.   The other accused have not\n\nindulged in any overt act.    There was no intention or pre-\n\nmeditation in the mind of the appellant to inflict such injuries\n\nto the deceased as were likely to cause death in the ordinary\n\ncourse of nature.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_37\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_38\">22.   On consideration of the entire evidence including the\n\nmedical evidence, we are clearly of the view that the conviction\n\nof the appellant cannot be sustained under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_46\">section 302</a> IPC,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">\f                                                           14</span>\n\nbut the appropriate section under which the appellant ought\n\nto be convicted is <a href=\"/doc/409589/\" id=\"a_47\">section 304</a> Part II <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_48\">IPC</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_39\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_40\">23.    Before we part with the case, we would like to clearly\n\nobserve that we are not laying down that in no case of single\n\nblow or injury, the accused cannot be convicted under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_49\">section\n\n302</a> IPC. In cases of single injury, the facts and circumstances\n\nof each case has to be taken into consideration before arriving\n\nat the conclusion whether the accused should be appropriately\n\nconvicted under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_50\">section 302</a> IPC or under <a href=\"/doc/409589/\" id=\"a_51\">section 304</a> Part II\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_52\">IPC</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_41\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_42\">24.

The list of circumstances enumerated above is only\n\nillustrative and not exhaustive. In our considered view, proper\n\nand appropriate sentence to the accused is the bounded\n\nobligation and duty of the court. The endeavour of the court\n\nmust be to ensure that the accused receives appropriate\n\nsentence, in other words, sentence should be according to the\n\ngravity of the offence.
