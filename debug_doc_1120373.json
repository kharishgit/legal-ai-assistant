It was alleged that when the deceased\t and\nhis companion, PW-4 were proceeding in a rickshaw, pulled by\nPW-3,  the  appellant and his five  companions\tlaunched  an\nattack\ton  them. While PW-4 received an injury by  a  cycle\nchain,\tthe  deceased received stab injuries, to  which\t the\nsuccumbed  on  the  spot. On the  First\t Information  Report\nlodged by PW-4, statements of three eye witnesses viz. PW-I,\nan  on-looker and PWs 3 and 4 recorded during the course  of\ninvestigation,\tand  the  evidence  regarding  discovery  of\nincriminating articles and find of human blood on them,\t the\nappellant and his five companions were chargesheeted for the\nmurder of the deceased.\n2\n    During the trial, two of the eye-witnesses,\t viz. PWs  3\nand  4\twere declared hostile, since  they  expressed  their\ninability  to identify the accused persons as assailants  of\nthe  deceased.\tThough\tPW 1 supported\tthe  prosecution  in\nexamination-in-chief, he expressed some doubt regarding\t the\nidentity  of  the appellant and one other assailant  in\t the\ncross-examination. The trial court refused to place reliance\non  the\t evidence of the three eye-witnesses  and  acquitted\nall, except the appellant. It convicted the appellant  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_7\">Section\t 302</a> IPC and sentenced him to life  imprisonment  on\nthe evidence that the appellant was absconding, that he\t had\ndiscovered  the\t weapon which was found to be  stained\twith\nhuman  blood  and the factum of find of human blood  on\t the\npant worn by him at the time of his arrest- The\t appellant&#x27;s\nappeal\twas dismissed by the High Court. While ignoring\t the\nevidence  of PWs 3 and 4, the High Court relied on the\tevi-\ndence of PW-1 holding that his subsequent attempt to  create\na  doubt regarding the identity of the appellant was  of  no\nconsequence,  since  there  was intrinsic  material  in\t his\nevidence to establish the presence of the appellant  amongst\nthe assailants of deceased. It also relied on the  discovery\nevidence  and find of human blood on the weapon and  on\t the\npant he was wearing at the time of his arrest. The State did\nnot  prefer  an appeal against the five\t companions  of\t the\nappellant who were acquitted by the trial court.\n    In the appeal before this Court on behalf of the  appel-\nlant  it  was  contended that (1)  the\tprosecution  version\nregarding the incident, particularly, the involvement of the\nappellant  was highly doubtful since the correctness of\t the\nFirst  Information Report, purported to have been lodged  by\nPW4  was itself doubtful since he had disowned it;  (2)\t the\npresence  of PW1 at the scene of offence and at the time  of\noccurrence was highly doubtful and the High Court  committed\nan  error in placing reliance on his testimony\tin  examina-\ntion-in-chief, while brushing aside his statement in  cross-\nexamination;  (3) same set of Panch witnesses had  been\t em-\nployed\tfor  all  the discovery panchnamas as  well  as\t the\nattachment of clothes of the appellant and others and  since\nPW5,  Panch witness was closely associated with\t the  family\nand  was  a stock witness for the prosecution,\tno  reliance\ncould be placed on the evidence of such a highly  interested\nand  chosen witness and consequently find of human blood  on\nthe  weapon and the pant lost its probative value;  (4)\t the\ntwo circumstances, viz. that the appellant was not found for\ntwo days, and human blood was present on the weapon and\t his\npant constituted extremely thin and weak evidence to  record\na  finding of guilt, particularly, when the trial court\t had\ndiscarded  all the eye-witnesses&#x27; evidence and\tdoubted\t the\ncontents of the FIR, and when the Serologist did not  deter-\nmine the blood group of the stains on the weapon and pant of\nthe\n3\nappellant; (5) in the absence of positive evidence that\t the\nfatal  injury&#x27; No. I was caused by the appellant  only,\t his\nconviction substantively under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 302</a> IPC could not  be\nsustained;  (6) since appellant&#x27;s companion were  acquitted,\nand  the  State had not preferred any appeal  against  their\nacquittal, he could not be convicted with the aid of <a href=\"/doc/94346/\" id=\"a_9\">Section\n34</a> or 149 <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_10\">IPC</a>, since the acquittal of the co-accused created\na  legal bar against his conviction, which could not be\t got\nover by reappreciation of evidence; and (7) the eye-witness-\nes&#x27; evidence could not be relied upon as their names did not\nfigure in the inquest report prepared at the earliest time.\n    On\tbehalf of the State it was contended that  (1)\tevi-\ndence  of PWs 3 and 4 could not be treated as  effaced\tfrom\nthe  record, merely because the prosecution chose  to  treat\nthem  as  hostile  on the limited question  of\tidentity  of\nassailants;(2) PW-I was neither a chance witness nor was  he\nfaking his presence at the scene of occurrence at the  mate-\nrial time; (3) it was not necessary in law to mention  names\nof witnesses in the inquest report as the purpose of prepar-\ning  the  report was merely to make a note of  the  physical\ncondition  of the body and the marks of injury\tthereon\t no-\nticed at that point of time; (4) nothing was alleged against\nPW-5. Panch witness, nor the appellant had given any  expla-\nnation regarding existence of human blood on the weapon\t and\nhis pant in his statement recorded under section 313 of\t the\nCr.  P.C.; (5) even if the appellant could not\tbe  substan-\ntively\tconvicted under Section 302 II&#x27;C, he could still  be\nconvicted  with\t the aid of <a href=\"/doc/94346/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 34</a> or 149 II&#x27;C,  if\t the\nCourt  came  to\t the conclusion that more  than\t one  person\nlaunched  the  attack and notwithstanding the  acquittal  of\nothers\tby the trial court, this Court could reach  its\t own\nconclusion as the higher court was not bound by the appreci-\nation of evidence by the trial court or even the High Court.\nDismissing the appeal, this Court,\n    HELD:  1.1 The evidence of a prosecution witness  cannot\nbe rejected in toto merely because the prosecution chose  to\ntreat him as hostile and cross-examined him. The evidence of\nsuch  witnesses cannot be treated as effaced or\t washed\t off\nthe  record altogether, but the same can be accepted to\t the\nextent their version is found to be dependable on a  careful\nscrutiny thereof. [13C]\n    Bhagwan Singh v. State of Haryana, [1976] 2 S.C.R.\t921:\nRabinder  Kumar Dey v. State of Orissa, [1976] 4 S.C.C.\t 233\nand  Syed  lqbal v.state of Karnataka, [1980] 1\t S.C.R.\t 95,\nrelied on.\n4\t\tSUPREME COURT REPORTS\t [1991] 3 S.C.R.\n    1.2 In the instant case the evidence of two eye-witness-\nes PW 3 and 4 challenged by the prosecution in\tcross-exami-\nnation because they refused to name the accused in the\tdock\nas  the assailants of the deceased. The trial court made  no\neffort\tto  scrutinise the evidence of these  two  witnesses\neven in regard to the factum of the incident. It refused  to\nlook  into their evidence treating it as non-est,  on  their\nbeing declared hostile by the prosecution. This approach  of\nthe trial court is legally unacceptable. The High Court\t has\nnot  endeavoured to assess their evidence since\t it  thought\nthat  the conviction of the appellant could be sustained  on\nthe  evidence of PW-1. From the evidence of these  two\twit-\nnesses the fact that the deceased and PW-4 came to the place\nof  occurrence\tin the rickshaw of PW-3 is  established.  So\nalso  the  fact that on their reaching the place  of  occur-\nrence,\tthey were surrounded by some persons and an  assault\nwas  launched on them in which PW 4 received an\t injury\t and\nthe  deceased died is also established. The only  area\tthey\nhave  not supported the prosecution and resiled\t from  their\nearlier statements is regarding the identity of the  assail-\nants  but  the fact remains that the deceased  had  received\nthree  injuries\t as  narrated by PW-12,\t who  conducted\t the\npost-mortem,  and  succumbed to the injuries  on  the  spot.\nSimilarly,  there is no doubt at all that PW-4 had  gone  to\nthe  police  station and had lodged  the  First\t Information\nReport.\t The  detailed narration about the incident  in\t the\nFirst  Information Report goes to show that  the  subsequent\nattempt of PW-4 to disown the document, while admitting\t his\nsignature,  thereon,  is a shift for reasons best  known  to\nhim. Once the presence of PW-4 is accepted, the presence  of\nPW-3  at  the scene of occurrence cannot be  doubted.  [13D,\n14C, D-F, B]\n    2.\tThe Trial Court has not accepted PW-I&#x27;s evidence  on\nthe ground that he was not a natural witness, and was only a\nchance witness. However, on a reading of the entire evidence\nof PW-I it is clear that his statement in  cross-examination\non the question of identity of the appellant and one of\t his\ncompanions is a clear attempt to wriggle out of what he\t had\nstated earlier in his examination-in-chief. Since the  inci-\ndent  occurred at a public place, it is reasonable to  infer\nthat the street light illuminated the place sufficiently  to\nenable\tthis witness to identify the assailants. During\t the\none month period that elapsed since the recording of  exami-\nnation-in-chief,  something transpired which made him  shift\nhis evidence on the question of identity to help the  appel-\nlant.  In the circumstance there is no doubt that  PW-I\t had\nample  opportunity  to identify the assailants\tof  the\t de-\nceased,\t his  presence\tat the scene of\t occurrence  is\t not\nunnatural nor is his statement that he had come to  purchase\nvegetables  unacceptable. There are no contradiction in\t his\nevidence to doubt his testimony. He is a totally independent\nwit-\n5\nness,  who had no cause to give false evidence\tagainst\t the\nappellant  and\this companions. Therefore, his\tevidence  is\nacceptable  regarding  the  time, place and  manner  of\t the\nincident  as well as the identity of the  assailants.  [14H-\n16C]\n    3.1 The evidence of eye-witnesses could not be  rejected\non the ground that their names did not figure in the inquest\nreport prepared at the earliest point of time. [16D]\n    3.2\t A perusal of <a href=\"/doc/411677/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 174</a> of the Criminal  Procedure\nCode  would clearly show that the object of the\t proceedings\nunder  this Section is merely to ascertain whether a  person\nhas  died  under suspicious circumstances  or  an  unnatural\ndeath and if so what is the apparent cause of the death. The\nquestion  regarding the details as tO how the  deceased\t was\nassaulted or who assaulteld him or under what  circumstances\nhe  was assaulted is foreign to the ambit and scope  of\t the\nproceedings  under  the\t section.  In  these  circumstances,\nneither\t in  practice nor in law, was it necessary  for\t the\npolice\tto have mentioned these details in the\tinquest\t re-\nport. [16E-F]\n    Pedda  Narain v. State of Andhra Pradesh,  [1975]  Supp.\nS.C.R. 84 relied on.\n    4.1 There was no injunction in law against the same\t set\nof  witnesses being present at the successive  enquiries  if\nnothing could be urged against them. Even in the case of  an\ninterested party, his evidence cannot be overlooked on\tthat\nground. [17G. E]\n    Himachal Pradesh Administration v. Omprakash,  [1972]  2\nS.C.R. 765, relied on.\n    4.2 In the instant case, merely because the same set  of\nPanch  witnesses  were\tused for Witnessing  all  the  three\ndiscoveries as well as the attachment of the clothes of\t the\nappellant  and his companions, PW-5&#x27;s evidence could not  be\ndiscarded since nothing had surfaced in crossexamination  to\nshake  his evidence. Besides, except being a good  neighbour\nnothing\t more is shown against him. As regards\trecovery  of\nweapon, as well as the appellant&#x27;s blood stained pant, there\nis  hardly  any\t effective cross-examination,  nor  has\t the\nappellant offered any explanation in his statement  recorded\nunder  <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 313</a> of the Criminal Procedure Code. Hence  PW\n5&#x27;s  evidence  cannot be rejected on the  specious  plea  of\nbeing  an  interested  witness. In  the\t circumstances,\t hi,\nevidence was rightly accepted by both the courts below.\t [17\nA, C -D, F, 18 A]\n6\n     5.1 The factum of find of the incriminating weapon from\nthe  appellant&#x27;s  garage, and his inability to\texplain\t the\npresence  of human blood thereon is a  circumstance  against\nhim.  Similarly,  the existence of human blood on  the\tpant\nthat he was wearing at the time of his arrest, for which  no\nexplanation  was  offered  by him, is  also  a\tcircumstance\nagainst\t him, particularly because no injury was noticed  on\nhim. [18B-D]\n    5.2 There is also direct testimony of PW-I, besides that\nof  PWs 3 and 4. The find of human blood on the\t weapon\t and\nthe pant, with no explanation for the same lends  corrobora-\ntion  to the testimony of PW-1. When he states that  he\t saw\nthe  appellant inflicting a knife blow on the  deceased.  In\nthe circumstances, it cannot be accepted that in the absence\nof determination of blood group, the find of human blood  is\nof no consequence. [19B-C]\n    Kansa Behera v. State of Orissa, [1987] 3 S.C.C. 480 and\nSurinder  Singh v. State of Punjab, [1989] Suppl.  2  S.C.C.\n21, distinguished.\n    6.1\t  No doubt it is not possible from the\tocular\tevi-\ndence  to record a definite finding of fact that the  appel-\nlant  had caused the fatal injury. On the contrary the\tevi-\ndence  of  PW-1 indicates that in all probability  the\tstab\nwound  inflicted by the appellant resulted in injury No.  2,\nwhich by itself was not sufficient in the ordinary course of\nnature to cause death. I Since the prosecution evidence does\nnot disclose that the fatal blow, which caused injury No.  1\nwas given by the appellant, it means that the fatal blow was\ngiven  by someone else, and this establishes the  fact\tthat\nmore  than one person participated in the commission of\t the\ncrime.\tOn  an independent examination appreciation  of\t the\nevidence  of  the three eye-witnesses, viz. PWs 1, 3  and  4\nthat  several persons had participated in the commission  of\nthe crime. The failure on the part of PWs 3 and 4 to identi-\nfy  the\t others does not alter the situation. On  the  other\nhand,  from the evidence of PW 1, it is clear that  some  of\nthe  accused  participated in the commission of\t the  crime.\n[19E, 25A-C]\n    6.2 No doubt in the absence of a State appeal, the\tHigh\nCourt  could  not,  nor can this Court\tinterfere  with\t the\nacquittal of the co-accused, but this Court is not bound  by\nthe  facts found proved on the appreciation of\tevidence  by\nthe courts below, and is, in law, entitled to reach its\t own\nconclusion  different  from the one recorded by\t the  courts\nbelow  on  a review of the evidence. The  acquittal  of\t the\naccused\t does not create a legal bar against the  conviction\nof  the\t appellant with the aid of <a href=\"/doc/94346/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 34</a>  or  149\t<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_15\">IPC</a>.\n[21C-F]\n7\nBrathi v.

[25D]\n      The  conviction of the appellant is  accordingly\tcon-\nfirmed and sentence awarded to him is maintained. [25E]\n      7.

Gambhir for the appearing parties.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">The Judgment of the Court was delivered by\n       AHMADI, J. This appeal by special leave is  preferred\nby  the\t appellant  Khujji @ Surender Tiwari  who  has\tbeen\nconvicted by both the courts below under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_18\">section 302</a> IPC for\nthe  murder of one Gulab. The facts leading to this  appeal,\nbriefly\t stated, are that on the evening of May 20,1978\t the\ndeceased Gulab and his companion PW4 Ramesh Chander hired  a\nRickshaw  to  go to the dispensary of Dr.  Mukherjee.  PW  3\nKishan Lal pulled the Rickshaw and while he was passing\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">8</span>\nthrough\t Suji Mohalla near Panchsheel Talkies the  appellant\nand  his companions surrounded the Rickshaw and launched  an\nattack on the deceased and his companion. PW 4 was the first\nto receive an injury by a cycle chain. Sensing trouble\tboth\nGulab and PW 4 jumped out of the Rickshaw and ran in differ-\nent directions. Gulab ran towards Suji Mohalla whereas PW  4\nran  towards  Panchsheel Talkies. They were  chased  by\t the\nassailants  who formed themselves into two groups. PW 4\t was\nfortunate  enough to escape with not too serious  an  injury\nbut  his  companion Gulab received stab wounds to  which  he\nsuccumbed  on  the spot. The evidence of PW  12\t Dr.  Nagpal\nshows that the deceased had received three injuries, namely,\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">(i)  a\tpenetrating stab wound with a second injury  on\t the\nintercostal  space on right side rib of the size of 3 cms  x\n5cms x Icm, (ii) a piercing stab wound 8cms below the scapu-\nlar  bone and 8cms outside the vertibral column of the\tsize\nof 2.5cms x 1.5cms x 3cms, and (iii) an incised wound on the\nfrontal\t auxiliary line 2.5cms x 1.Scms x 2cms deep  on\t the\nleft  hipocardium  region. This witness, who  performed\t the\npost-mortem, deposed that injury No.1 which had injured\t the\nheart  was  sufficient in the ordinary course of  nature  to\ncause  death. He further stated that all the three  injuries\nwere  collectively  sufficient to cause\t death\tin  ordinary\ncourse of nature. The three articles, namely, the knife, the\nChhuri\tand the Chhura which were attached in the course  of\ninvestigation were shown to this witness and he stated\tthat\nthe three injuries were possible by the aforesaid  articles.\nIt  is clear from this evidence that Gulab died a  homicidal\ndeath.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\">    To bring home the guilt against the appellant the prose-\ncution placed reliance on the evidence of three eye-witness-\nes, namely, PW 1 Komal Chand (an on-looker), PW 3 Kishan Lal\n(the Rickshaw Puller) and PW 4 Ramesh (the companion of\t the\ndeceased)  besides  the find of human blood  on\t the  weapon\ndiscovered at the instance of the appellant and on the\tlant\nwhich he was wearing at the time of his arrest.\n    The First Information Report, Exh. P-3, was lodged by PW\n4  Ramesh  immediately after the incident and the  same\t was\nrecorded  by the Investigating Officer PW 13 Ramji Singh  at\nabout  9.15 p.m. In the said first information report  PW  4\ngave  the details regarding the incident and  furnished\t the\nnames of all the six assailants. Soon after the first infor-\nmation\treport was lodged the Investigating Officer  visited\nthe  scene  of occurrence and drew up the Panchnama  on\t the\nbasis of which a sketch plan Exh. P-20A was prepared in\t due\ncourse.\t The appellant and some of his companions could\t not\nbe  traced till May 22, 1978. After they were  traced,\tthey\nwere interrogated and on their expressing\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">9</span>\nwillingness  to discover the weapons used in the  commission\nof  the crime, the Investigating Officer summoned  two\twit-\nnesses, namely, PW 5 Panna Lal and Rajinder to act as  Panch\nwitnesses.  The prosecution case is that in the presence  of\nthese  witnesses the appellant and his companions made\tcer-\ntain  confessional statements under <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_19\">section 27</a>\tof  Evidence\nAct  which led to the discovery of the weapons used  in\t the\ncommission  of the crime. According to the  prosecution\t the\nappellant Khujji discovered a Chhura (knife) from his garage\nand  the  same was attached under the  Panchnama  Exh.\tP-9.\nSince  this weapon had bloodlike stains, it was sent to\t the\nChemical Analyser and Serologist for examination and report.\nThe  report indicates that it was stained with\thuman  blood\nbut  the blood group could not be determined. The other\t two\ncompanions  of the appellant, namely, Parsu and Guddu,\talso\ndiscovered a knife, Exh.[P-7, and a Chhura, Exh. P-13, which\nwere  attached under Panchnamas Exh] P-6 and  P-12,  respec-\ntively. As stated earlier the shirt and pant of Khujji\twere\nalso  attached\tas blood-like stains were  noticed  thereon.\nBoth  these articles were sent to the Chemical Analyser\t and\nSerologist.  So\t far as the shirt is  concerned,  since\t the\nblood  stains  were  disintegrated it was  not\tpossible  to\ndetermine  the\torigin thereof. But so far as  the  pant  is\nconcerned,  the report states that the stains were of  human\nblood  but  the blood group could not be determined  as\t the\nresult\tof  the test was inconclusive. On the basis  of\t the\nfirst information report, the statements of three  witnesses\nrecorded  in  the  course of investigation as  well  as\t the\nevidence regarding discovery and the find of human blood  on\nthe  incriminating articles, the appellant and\tfive  others\nwere charge-sheeted for the murder of Gulab. The trial court\nacquitted  all except the appellant. Before the trial  court\nPW  4 Ramesh, who had lodged the first\tinformation  report,\ntried to disown it. He was declared hostile as he  expressed\nhis inability to identify the accused persons as the assail-\nants of the deceased Gulab. PW 3, the Rickshaw Puller, while\nnarrating the incident expressed a similar inability and  he\ntoo was treated as hostile and cross-examined by the  Public\nProsecutor. The third eye-witness PW 1 Komal chand, however,\nsupported  the prosecution case in his\texamination-in-chief\nbut in his cross-examination he expressed some doubt regard-\ning the identity of the appellant and Guddu stating that  he\nhad  seen  their  backs only. The trial court  came  to\t the\nconclusion  that not only was this witness a chance  witness\nbut  his presence at the scene of occurrence  was  extremely\ndoubtful as it was difficult to believe that he had come out\nat  that hour to purchase vegetables. Thus the\ttrial  court\nrefused to place reliance on the evidence of the three\teye-\nwitnesses. The trial court, however, came to the  conclusion\nthat the appellant was absconding and that he had discovered\nthe weapon\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">10</span>\nwhich  was  found to be stained with human  blood.  It\talso\nrelied on the factum of find of human blood on the pant worn\nby the appellant at the time of his arrest. On the basis  of\nthis evidence the trial court convicted the appellant  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_20\">section\t 302</a>  IPC and sentenced him  to\t life  imprisonment.\nKhujji preferred an appeal against the said conviction.\t The\nHigh  Court while ignoring the evidence of PW 3\t Kishan\t Lal\nand  PW 4 Ramesh relied on the evidence of PW 1 Komal  Chand\nand came to the conclusion that his evidence clearly  estab-\nlished\tthe presence of the appellant as one of the  assail-\nants  notwithstanding  his effort  in  cross-examination  to\nwriggle\t out  of  his statement\t in  examination-inchief  in\nregard\tto  the identity of the appellant.  The\t High  Court\nnoticed\t that the examination-in-chief of this\twitness\t was\nrecorded on November 16, 1976 whereas his  cross-examination\ncommenced  on  December 15, 1976 i.e. after a month  and  in\nbetween he seemed to have been won over or had succumbed  to\nthreat.\t This  inference was drawn on the basis\t of  PW\t 3&#x27;s\nstatement that he was severely beaten on the night  previous\nto  his\t appearance in court as a witness. The\tHigh  Court,\ntherefore, took the view that the subsequent attempt of PW 1\nKomal Chand to create a doubt regarding the identity of\t the\nappellant  was of no consequence since there  was  intrinsic\nmaterial  in his evidence to establish the presence  of\t the\nappellant amongst the assailants of deceased Gulab.  Relying\nfurther\t on  the discovery evidence as well as the  find  of\nhuman  blood  on  the weapon found from the  garage  of\t the\nappellant  and on his pant which he was wearing at the\ttime\nof  his arrest, the High Court came to the  conclusion\tthat\nhis conviction was well founded and dismissed his appeal. It\nmay  here  be  mentioned that the State did  not  prefer  an\nappeal against the five companions of the appellant who came\nto  be acquitted by the trial court. It is in these  circum-\nstances\t that the appellant has invoked this Court&#x27;s  juris-\ndiction under <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_21\">Article 136</a> of the Constitution.\n    Mr. U.R. Lalit, learned counsel for the appellant,\ttook\nus through the entire evidence and submitted that the prose-\ncution\tversion\t regarding the\tincident,  particularly\t the\ninvolvement  of the appellant, is highly doubtful since\t the\ncorrectness  of the statement made in the first\t information\nreport\tpurporting  to have been lodged by PW  4  Ramesh  is\nitself\tdoubtful  because Ramesh himself has  dis-owned\t it.\nSince the prosecution had declared both PW 3 Kishan Lal\t and\nPW  4 Ramesh as hostile to the prosecution the\ttrial  court\nwas  justified\tin refusing to rely on\ttheir  evidence.  He\nfurther\t submitted that the presence of PW 1 Komal Chand  at\nthe place of occurrence at that hour was highly doubtful and\nthis  doubt was reinforced by his conduct in not  raising  a\nhue and cry or going to the help of the victim. The evidence\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">11</span>\ndisclosed  that this witness resides at a place\t almost\t two\nfurlongs  from\tthe scene of occurrence and claims  to\thave\nseen  the incident from a distance of about 22 feet  from  a\npoint  wherefrom the incident could not have been  witnessed\nby  him\t as is evident from the physical  condition  of\t the\nlocality   described   in  this\t sketch\t Exh.\tP-20A.\t He,\ntherefore,/ submitted that the trial court was justified  in\ndescribing this witness as a chance witness and in  doubting\nhis  presence  at the scene of occurrence  at  the  relevant\npoint of time. According to him the High Court committed  an\nerror in placing reliance on the testimony of this  witness.\nHe,  however, submitted that the trial court was not  justi-\nfied  in recording the conviction on the mere fact that\t the\nappellant  could  not be found for two days  and  there\t was\nhuman blood on his weapon and pant attached in the course of\ninvestigation.\tThese two circumstances, contended  counsel,\nconstituted  extremely\tthin and weak evidence to  record  a\nfinding\t of  guilt  particularly when the  trial  Court\t had\ndiscarded  the evidence of all the three  eye-witnesses\t and\nhad  doubted  the contents of the first\t information  report\nExh. P-3. Lastly he submitted that the High Court  committed\nan error in brushing aside the statement made by PW 1  Komal\nChand  in his cross-examination which went to show that\t his\nevidence  regarding  identity of the  appellant\t was  highly\nsuspect.  Merely  because there was a time gap\tbetween\t his\nexamination-in-chief  and  his\tcross-examination  the\tHigh\nCourt  was not justified in jumping to the  conclusion\tthat\nthe  accused  party  had succeeded in winning  him  over  by\nthreat\tor  otherwise. On this line of reasoning  Mr.  Lalit\ncontended  that the High Court ought not to have  interfered\nwith  the appreciation of his evidence by the  trial  court.\nBesides these submissions based on the evidence of the three\neyewitnesses  and the find of human blood on the weapon\t and\npant of the appellant, Mr. Lalit further submitted that\t one\nset  of\t Panch witnesses, PW 5 Pannalal\t and  Rajinder\t(not\nexamined), had been employed for all the discovery  panchna-\nmas  as well as the attachment of clothes of  the  appellant\nand others which went to show that PW 5 was a stock  witness\nfor the prosecution. He, therefore, submitted that no  reli-\nance could be placed on the evidence of PW 5 and consequent-\nly the find of human blood on the weapon and the pant looses\nits  probative value. In the end he submitted that the\tcon-\nviction of the appellant substantively under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_22\">section 302</a> IPC\nwas not well founded for the simple reason that not a single\nwitness had deposed that the fatal injury was caused by\t the\nappellant.  The evidence of PW 12 Dr. Nagpal shows that\t the\ndeceased had three injuries and out of them only injury\t No.\n1 was by itself sufficient in the ordinary course of  nature\nto  cause  death. So far as injuries Nos. 2 and 3  are\tcon-\ncerned,\t the medical evidnce does not show that each one  of\nthem separately was sufficient in the ordinary\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">12</span>\ncourse of nature to cause death. But the medical evidence is\nto the effect that all the three injuries taken collectively\nWere  SuffiCient in the ordinary course of nature  to  cause\ndeath. In the absence of positive evidence that injury No. 1\nwas  caused by the appellant and none else,  his  conviction\nsubstantively under section 302 cannot be sustained. In that\ncase at best he can be convicted for hurt under <a href=\"/doc/724142/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 324</a>,\nIPC.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_7\">    further submitted that since his companions were acquit-\nted and the State had not preferred any appeal against their\nacquittal he could not be convicted with the aid of <a href=\"/doc/94346/\" id=\"a_24\">sections\n34</a> or 149 <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_25\">IPC</a>.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">    Mr.\t Prithvi Singh, the learned counsel for\t the  State,\nsubmitted  that the trial court was wrong in  rejecting\t the\nevidence  of PWs 3 and 4 merely because they  were  declared\nhostile as if their evidence was totally against the  prose-\ncution\ton  that account. He submitted that  their  evidence\ncannot be treated as effaced from the record merely  because\nthe prosecution chose to treat them as hostile on the limit-\ned\nquestion of identity of the assailants. Their evidence as to\nthe occurrence and number of persons involved in the commis-\nsion of the crime can be relied upon along with that of PW 1\nas  he\twas neither a chance witness nor was he\t faking\t his\npresence  at the scene of occurrence at the  material  time.\nHis evidence regarding identity of the assailants is equally\nacceptable and his subsequent statement made in\t crossexami-\nnation\tafter  a time gap of almost one\t month\twas  rightly\nbrushed aside by the High Court, whatever be the reason\t for\nhis change of heart. With regard to the criticism  regarding\nthe  absence  of names of witnesses in the  Inquest  Report,\ncounsel\t urged that it was not necessary in law\t to  mention\nthe  names  of the witnesses in the inquest  report  as\t the\npurpose of preparing the inquest report was merely to make a\nnote of the physical condition of the body and the marks  of\ninjury there of noticed at that point of time. On the  ques-\ntion  of value to be attached to the evidence of  the  Panch\nwitness\t PW  5, counsel submitted that nothing\twas  alleged\nagainst this witness nor had the appellant given any  expla-\nnation regarding existence of human blood on the weapon\t and\nthe  pant attached from him in his statement recorded  under\nsection\t 313  of  the Code. On the  question  regarding\t the\noffence\t committed by the appellant, counsel submitted\tthat\nonce it is proved that more than one person had participated\nin  the\t assault, the appellant could be convicted  for\t the\nmurder\tof  the deceased with the aid of <a href=\"/doc/94346/\" id=\"a_26\">section 34</a>  or\t 149\n<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_27\">IPC</a>.  He,  therefore, submitted that the appeal\t is  without\nmerit and deserves to be dismissed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"194959\" id=\"span_6\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1027045\" id=\"span_7\">We\thave given our anxious consideration to the  submis-\nsions  made by the learned counsel for the  contesting\tpar-\nties. The fact that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">13</span>\nan incident of the type alleged by the prosecution  occurred\non May 20, 1978 at about 8.20 p.m. is not seriously disputed\nnor is the location of the incident doubted. The evidence of\nPW  3 Kishan Lal and PW 4 Ramesh came to be rejected by\t the\ntrial court because they were declared hostile to the prose-\ncution\tby the learned Public Prosecutor as they refused  to\nidentify the appellant and his companions in the dock as the\nassailants  of\tthe deceased. But counsel for the  State  is\nright  when he submits that the evidence of a  witness,\t de-\nclared\thostile, is not wholly effaced from the\t record\t and\nthat  part of evidence which is otherwise acceptable can  be\nacted upon. It seems to be well settled by the decisions  of\nthis  Court <a href=\"/doc/1027045/\" id=\"a_28\">Bhagwan Singh v. State of Haryana</a>, [1976] 2\t SCR\n921; <a href=\"/doc/194959/\" id=\"a_29\">Rabinder Kumar Dey v. State of Orissa</a>, [1976] 4 SCC 233\nand  Syed lqbal v. State of Karnataka, [1980] 1 SCR 95\tthat\nthe evidence of a prosecution witness cannot be rejected  in\ntoto  merely because the prosecution chose to treat  him  as\nhostile and crossexamined him. The evidence of such witness-\nes  cannot  be treated as effaced or washed off\t the  record\naltogether but the same can be accepted to the extent  their\nversion\t is  found to be dependable on\ta  careful  scrutiny\nthereof.  In the present case the evidence of the  aforesaid\ntwo  eye-witnesses  was\t challenged by\tthe  prosecution  in\ncross-examination  because they refused to name the  accused\nin  the\t dock as the assailants of the deceased. We  are  in\nagreement with the submission of the learned counsel for the\nState that the trial court made no effort to scrutinise\t the\nevidence of these two witnesses even in regard to the factum\nof  the incident. On a careful consideration of\t their\tevi-\ndence it becomes crystal clear that PW 4 had accompanied the\ndeceased in PW 3&#x27;s rickshaw to the place of incident. In the\nincident  that occurred at the location pointed out  by\t the\nprosecution,  PW 4 sustained an injury. His presence in\t the\ncompany\t of the deceased at the place of occurrence,  there-\nfore,  cannot  be doubted. Immediately\tafter  the  incident\nwithin\tless  than an hour thereof PW 4 went to\t the  police\nstation and lodged the first information report. It is\ttrue\nthat  the first information report is not  substantive\tevi-\ndence but the fact remains that immediately after the  inci-\ndent  and before there was any extraneous intervention PW  4\nwent  to the police station and narrated the  incident.\t The\nfirst  information report is a detailed document and  it  is\nnot  possible  to  believe that\t the  investigating  officer\nimagined  those details and prepared the document Exh. P  3.\nThe  detailed  narration  about the incident  in  the  first\ninformation report goes to show that the subsequent  attempt\nof PW 4 to dis-own the document, while admitting his  signa-\nture thereon, is a shift for reasons best known to PW 4.  We\nare,  therefore, not prepared to accept the  criticism\tthat\nthe  version  regarding the incident is the result  of\tsome\nfertile thinking on the part\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">14</span>\nOf  the investigating officer. We are satisfied, beyond\t any\nmanner\tof doubt, that PW 4 had gone to the  police  station\nand  had lodged the first information report. To the  extent\nhe has been contradicted with the facts stated in the  first\ninformation  report shows that he has tried to\tresile\tfrom\nhis  earlier  version regarding the incident.  So  also\t the\npresence of PW 3 at the scene of occurrence cannot be doubt-\ned  once the presence of PW 4 is accepted. The\ttrial  court\ndid  not go so far as to say that both these witnesses\twere\nnot present at the scene of occurrence or that PW 4 was\t not\ninjured\t in  the  incident but refused to  look\t into  their\nevidence treating their evidence as non-est on their&#x27;  being\ndeclared  hostile by the prosecution. We think that the\t ap-\nproach\tof the trial court insofar as the evidence of  these\ntwo  witnesses\tis concerned, is legally  unacceptable.\t The\nHigh  Court  has not endeavoured to  assess  their  evidence\nsince it thought that the conviction of the appellant  could\nbe  sustained  on the evidence of PW 1 Komal Chand.  We\t are\nsatisfied on a close scrutiny of the evidence of the  afore-\nsaid two eyewitnesses, PWs 3 and 4, that the deceased and PW\n4 came to the place of occurrence in the rickshaw pulled  by\nPW 3. On reaching the spot where the incident occurred\tthey\nwere  surrounded by certain persons who were lying  in\twait\nand  a murderous assault was launched on them. The first  to\nreceive the injury was PW 4. When they gauged the  intention\nof their assailants they jumped out of the rickshaw and both\nran  in different directions. The appellant first  tried  to\nchase  PW  4 but later he turned to the deceased as  he\t was\ninformed  by one of his companions Gopal that the person  he\nwas pursuing was not Gulab. Therefore, from the evidence  of\nthese two eye-witnesses the fact that the deceased and PW  4\ncame  to the place of occurrence in the rickshaw of PW 3  is\nestablished.  So  also the fact that on their  reaching\t the\nplace of occUrrence they were surrounded by some persons and\nan  assault was launched on them in which PW 4\treceived  an\ninjury and Gulab died is clearly established. The only\tarea\nwhere  they  have  not supported the  prosecution  and\thave\nresiled\t from  their  earlier statements  is  regarding\t the\nidentity  of the assailants. We will deal with that part  of\nthe  evidence a little later but the fact remains  that\t the\ndeceased  had received three injuries as narrated by  PW  12\nDr.  Nagpal, to which he succumbed on the spot.\t Once  these\nfacts are accepted as proved, the only question which really\nsurvives  for consideration is whether the appellant was  an\nassailant of the deceased.</span></span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">    That  brings  us to the evidence of PW  1  Komal  Chand.\nKomal  Chand&#x27;s evidence was not accepted by the trial  court\non the ground that he was not a natural witness and was only\na  chance  witness. PW 1 explained his presence\t by  stating\nthat he had gone to the market to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">15</span>\npurchase vegetables and while he was returning therefrom  on\nfoot with his cycle in hand he heard a commotion and saw the\nincident  from\ta short distance. Being a resident  of\tSuji\nMohalla, the place of occurrence was clearly in the vicinity\nthereof\t and,  therefore, his presence at the  market  place\ncould not be considered to be unnatural. It is not unnatural\nfor working people to purchase vegetables at that hour\tand,\ntherefore, his explanation regarding his presence cannot  be\nruled out as false. The sketch map prepared by PW 11  Gaiser\nPrasad\tshows  that he had seen the incident  from  a  short\ndistance of hardly 22 feet although PW 1 says he saw it from\nthe  square. Since the incident occurred at a  public  place\nwith  a\t lamp-post  nearby, the possibility  of\t his  having\nidentified the assailants could not be ruled out. The exami-\nnation-i-nchief of this witness was recorded on November 16,\n1976  when  he\tidentified all the assailants  by  name.  He\nstated\tthat  he knew the six accused persons in  court\t and\nthey  were the persons who had surrounded the  rickshaw\t and\nlaunched an assault on PW 4 and the deceased Gulab. Of\tthem\nGopal  struck  PW 4 with a chain. He also  stated  that\t the\nappellant  Khujji  and his companions Gudda and\t Parsu\twere\narmed with knives and when Khujji tried to assault PW 4 with\na knife, Gopal shouted Khujji that man is not Gulab&quot;. There-\nupon Khujji and his companions ran after the Gulab, overtook\nhim and the appellant, Parsu and Gudda assaulted Gulab\twith\ntheir  weapons.\t Gudda struck Gulab from the  front  on\t his\nchest,\tParsu stabbed him on the side of the  stomach  while\nRam Kishan and Gopal held him and the appellant attacked him\nfrom behind with a knife whereupon Gulab staggered  shouting\n&#x27;save-save&#x27;  and  fell\tin front of the\t house\tof  Advocate\nChintaman Sahu. Thereafter all the six persons ran away. His\ncross  examination commenced on 15th December, 1978. In\t his\ncrossexamination  he  stated that the appellant\t Khujji\t and\nGudda had their backs towards him and hence he could not see\ntheir  faces  while  he could identify\tthe  remaining\tfour\npersons.  He stated that he had inferred that the other\t two\npersons\t were the appellant and Gudda. On the basis of\tthis\nstatement Mr.Lalit submitted that the evidence regarding the\nidentity of the appellant is rendered highly doubtful and it\nwould  be hazardous to convict the appellant solely  on\t the\nbasis of identification by such a wavering witness. The High\nCourt  came to the conclusion and, in our  opinion  rightly,\nthat  during  the one month period that\t elapsed  since\t the\nrecording  of his examination-in-chief something  transpired\nwhich made him shift his evidence on the question of identi-\nty  to help the appellant. We are satisfied on a reading  of\nhis entire evidence that his statement in  cross-examination\non the question of identity of the appellant and his compan-\nion is a clear attempt to wriggle out of what he had  stated\nearlier in his examination-in-chief.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">16</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_11\">Since the incident occurred at a public place, it is reason-\nable  to infer that the street lights illuminated the  place\nsufficiently to enable this witness to identify the  assail-\nants.  We have, therefore, no hesitation in concluding\tthat\nhe  had\t ample\topportunity to identify\t the  assailants  of\nGulab, his presence at the scene of occurrence is not unnat-\nural nor his statement that he had come to purchase  vegata-\nbles unacceptable:We do not find any material contradictions\nin  his\t evidence to doubt his testimony. He  is  a  totally\nindependent witness who had no cause to give false  evidence\nagainst the appellant and his companions. We are, therefore,\nnot  impressed by the reasons which weighed that  the  trial\ncourt  for  rejecting his evidence. We agree with  the\tHigh\nCourt  that his evidence is acceptable regarding  the  time,\nplace and manner of the incident as well as the identity  of\nthe assailants.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">    It\twas faintly submitted by counsel for  the  appellant\nthat the evidence of eye-witnesses could not be relied\tupon\nas their names did not figure in the inquest report prepared\nat  the\t earliest  point&#x27;of time. We see no  force  in\tthis\nsubmission in view of the clear pronouncement of this  Court\nin Pedda Narain v. State of Andhra Pradesh, [1975] Supp. SCR\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">84. Referring to section 174 of the Code of Criminal  Proce-\ndure this Court observed at page 89 as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">\t      &quot;A  perusal  of this provision  would  clearly\n\t      show that the object of the proceedings  under\n\t      section  174 is merely to ascertain whether  a\n\t      person has died under suspicious circumstances\n\t      or  an unnatural death and if so what  is\t the\n\t      apparent\tcause  of the  death.  The  question\n\t      regarding\t the details as to how the  deceased\n\t      was  assaulted or who assaulted him  or  under\n\t      what circumstances he was assaulted appears to\n\t      us to be foreign to the ambit and scope of the\n\t      proceedings  under section 174. In these\tcir-\n\t      cumstances, therefore, neither in practice nor\n\t      in law was it necessary for the police to have\n\t      mentioned\t  these\t details  in   the   inquest\n\t      report&quot;.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_14\">We,  respectfully agree and see no merit in this  submission\nmade by the counsel for the appellant.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">    After  the\tappellant and his two companions  Parsu\t and\nGudda  were arrested they were interrogated by the  investi-\ngating officer PW 13 Ramji Singh. In the course of  interro-\ngation they showed their willingness to point out the  weap-\nons  of assault. thereupon the investigating officer  called\ntwo Panchas, one of them being PW 5\nPanna Lal. The very same Panch witnesses were panchas to all\nthe three discovery panchnamas as well as panchnamas regard-\ning the attachment of the clothes worn by the appellant\t and\nhis companions. It was, therefore, contended by the  counsel\nfor  the  appellant that PW 5 Panna Lal was a  stock  witnes\nwhom  the  police had employed to act as  a  panch  witness.\nPointing  out that it was Tulsi Ram the brother of  the\t de-\nceased who had chosen him because he was closely  associated\nwith  the  family  of the deceased and\twas  intimated\twith\nBabulal another brother of the deceased, Mr. Lalit submitted\nthat  no reliance can be placed on the evidence of  such  an\nhighly interested and specially chosen witness. The  witness\ncomes from the same locality and his house is situate within\n100  yards  of the residence of the deceased. He  knows\t the\nfamily\tof the deceased quite well being a neighbour and  of\nthe same &#x27;biradari&#x27;. It is equally true that he had gone  to\nthe hospital on learning about the assault on Gulab and\t had\nstayed\tback with Babulal since the latter was\tnot  feeling\nwell.  But would it be proper to throw out his\tevidence  on\naccount of his neighbourly relations with the family of\t the\ndeceased, when nothing has been brought out in crossexamina-\ntion  to  shake the intrinsic value to be  attached  to\t his\nevidence? Even in the cross-examination of the investigating\nofficer\t nothing  has  been brought out to  infer  that\t the\nchoice of PW 5 as a Panch witness was a deliberate one\tmade\nwith  a\t view to enlisting his support\tto  the\t prosecution\ncase. The mere fact that he was a witness to all the  Panch-\nnamas prepared by the investigating officer is by itself not\nsufficient  to discard his evidence. Even in the case of  an\ninterested  witness,  it is settled law\t that  his  evidence\ncannot\tbe overlooked merely on that ground but at the\tmost\nit must receive strict scrutiny. In the case of PW 5, except\nbeing  a good neighbour nothing more is shown. On the  ques-\ntion of recovery of the weapon as well as the blood  stained\npant  of the appellant there is hardly any effective  crose-\nexamination.  Nor has the appellant offered any\t explanation\nin his statement recorded under <a href=\"/doc/1031309/\" id=\"a_30\">section 3</a> <a href=\"/doc/808094/\" id=\"a_31\">13</a> of the Code. In\nthese  circumstances we are not prepared to reject his\tevi-\ndence  on the specious plea of his being an interested\twit-\nness.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1583528\" id=\"span_12\">In <a href=\"/doc/1583528/\" id=\"a_32\">`Himachal Pradesh Administration v.

There was no\ninjunction  in law against the same set of  witnesses  being\npresent\t at  the successive enquiries if  nothing  could  be\nurged  against them. It is, therefore, clear from the  deci-\nsion of this Court that merely because the same set of Panch\nwitnesses were used for witnessing all the three discoveries\nas well as the attachment of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">18</span>\nclothes of the appellant and his companions, PW5&#x27;s  evidence\ncould not be discarded since nothing had surfaced in  cross-\nexamination to shake his evidence. We are, therefore, satis-\nfied that the evidence of PW5 Pannalal was rightly  accepted\nby  both the courts below. We make limited use of this\tevi-\ndence  in the sense that we do not use any part of the\tevi-\ndence admissible under <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_33\">section 27</a>. <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_34\">Evidence Act</a>, against the\nappellant. We merely use the factum of find of the  incrimi-\nnating\tweapon from his garage and his inability to  explain\nthe  presence  of  human blood\tthereon\t as  a\tcircumstance\nagainst\t the  appellant. The evidence of PW5  further  shows\nthat  when the appellant was arrested his garments,  namely,\nshirt  and  pant  were attached as  blood-like\tstains\twere\nnoticed\t thereon. These articles were sent to  the  Chemical\nAnalyser  and  Serologist  for examination  and\t report.  As\nstated earlier these reports reveal that the blood stains on\nthe  pant  worn by the appellant were of human\torigin.\t The\nappellant has not offered any plausible explanation for\t the\nexistence of human blood on his pant. This too is a  circum-\nstance against the appellant particularly because no  injury\nwas noticed on the person of the appellant.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">    Mr. Lalit, however, argued that since the report of\t the\nserologist does not determine the blood group of the  stains\non  the weapon and the pant of the appellant, the mere\tfind\nof  human blood on these two articles is of no\tconsequence,\nwhatsoever.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1594055\" id=\"span_14\">In support of this contention he placed  strong\nreliance  on the decisions of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1594055/\" id=\"a_35\">Kansa Behera  v.\nState  of  Orissa</a>, [1987] 3 SCC 480 and\t Surinder  Singh  v.\nState  of Punjab, [1989] Suppl. 2 SCC 21. In the first\tmen-\ntioned\tcase  the conviction was sought to be  sustained  on\nthree  circumstances,  namely,\t(i) the\t appellant  and\t the\ndeceased were last seen together; (ii) a dhoti\tand a  shirt\nrecovered from the possession of the appellant were found to\nbe  stained  with human blood; and (iii) the  appellant\t had\nmade  an  extra-judicial confession to\ttwo  witnesses\twhen\narrested.  There was no dispute in regard to the first\tcir-\ncumstance and the third circumstance was held not  satisfac-\ntorily proved. In this backdrop the question for  considera-\ntion was whether the first and the second circumstances were\nsufficient to convict the appellant. This Court,  therefore,\nobserved that a few small bloodstains could be of the appel-\nlant himself and in the absence of evidence regarding  blood\ngroup  it cannot conclusively connect the  bloodstanis\twith\nthe blood of the deceased. In these circumstances this Court\nrefused\t to draw any inference of guilt on the basis of\t the\nsaid  circumstance since it was not  &#x27;conclusive&#x27;  evidence.\nThis Court, however, did not go so far as to say that such a\ncircumstance  does not even provide a link in the  chain  of\ncircumstances  on which the prosecution can place  reliance.\nIn the second case also this\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">19</span>\nCourt  did not consider the evidence regarding the  find  of\nhuman blood on the knife sufficient to convict the appellant\nin  the\t absence of determination of blood group  since\t the\nevidence  of PW 2 was found to be uninspiring and there\t was\nno other circumstance to connect him with the crime. In this\ncase  we  have\tthe direct testimony of PW  1  Komal  Chand,\nbesides\t the testimony of PWs 3 and 4 which we have  consid-\nered earlier. The find of hunam blood on the weapon and\t the\npant of the appellant lends coroboration to the testimony of\nPW 1 Komal Chand when he states that he had seen the  appel-\nlant inflicting a knife blow on the deceased. The  appellant\nhas  not explained the presence of human blood on these\t two\narticles. We are, therefore, of the opinion that the  afore-\nsaid two decisions turned on the peculiar facts of each case\nand  they do not lay down a general proposition that in\t the\nabsence\t of determination of blood group the find  of  human\nblood  on  the\tweapon or garment of the accused  is  of  no\nconsequence. We, therefore, see no substance in this conten-\ntion urged by Mr. Lalit.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_17\">    That  brings us to the last contention whether the\tcon-\nviction\t of  the appellant for the  substantive\t offence  of\nmurder can be sustained in the absence of a finding that the\nfatal  injury No. 1 was caused by the appellant. We must  at\nonce  acceptt  the  fact that it is not\t possible  from\t the\nocular evidence to record a definte of fact that the  appel-\nlant had caused that fatal injury. On the contrary the\tevi-\ndence of PW 1 Komal Chand indicates that in all\t probability\nthe stab wound inflicted by the appellant resulted in injury\nNo.  2.\t that  injury by itself was not\t sufficient  in\t the\noridinary  course of nature to cause death. If that  be\t so,\ncan  the  appellant  be convicted under\t <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_36\">section  302</a>,\tIPC?\nCounsel for the appellant submits that the legal position is\nwell-settled  by a chain of decisions of this Court that  if\nnamed  accused\tare acquitted except one of  the  them,\t the\nlatter\tcannot\tbe convicted with the aid of <a href=\"/doc/94346/\" id=\"a_37\">section  34</a>  or\n149,  <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_38\">IPC</a>.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"684623\" id=\"span_16\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1431584\" id=\"span_17\">In\tsupport of this contention  he\tinvited\t our\nattention to a few decisions, namely, Baikuntha Nath  Chaud-\nhury  v.

Counsel\nfor  the  state,  however, submitted that while\t it  may  be\ncorrect that the appellant cannot be substantively convicted\nunder  <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_41\">section 302</a>, IPC, he can certainly be convicted\twith\nthe aid of <a href=\"/doc/94346/\" id=\"a_42\">section 34</a> or 149, <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_43\">IPC</a>, if this Court on a  reap-\npreciation of the evidence comes to the conclusion that more\nthan  one person, may be six or seven of them, had  launched\nan  attack on the deceased.

State of Punjab</a>,\t[199\n1]  1 SCC 519. Counsel for the appellant on the\t other\thand\ncontended  that\t the acquittal of the co-accused  creates  a\nlegal  bar  against the conviction of the appellant  on\t the\nground\tthat  they were privy to the  crime  notwithstanding\ntheir  acquittal  and this legal bar cannot be got  over  by\nreappreciation of evidence.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"939953\" id=\"span_20\">In support of this contention he\ninvited\t our  attention to a Five-Judge\t Bench\tdecision  in\n<a href=\"/doc/939953/\" id=\"a_45\">Krishna\t Govind Patil V.

In that case, the appel-\nlant and his uncle were tried under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_48\">section 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_49\">34</a>, IPC. The\nTrial  Court acquitted the appellant&#x27;s uncle  but  convicted\nthe appellant under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_50\">section 302</a>, IPC. The order of acquittal\nbecame\tfinal because the State did not choose to  challenge\nit  in appeal. The appellant, however, preferred  an  appeal\nagainst his conviction to the High Court. The `High Court on\na  reappreciation of the evidence held that the\t fatal\tblow\nwas  given by the appellant&#x27;s uncle and since the  appellant\nwas  charged  under  <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_51\">section 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_52\">34</a>, IPC, he  could  not  be\nconvicted substantively under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_53\">section 302</a>, IPC. However, for\nassessing the credibility of the prosecution case, the\tHigh\nCourt incidentally considered the involvement of the  appel-\nlant&#x27;s\tuncle  and held that the eye witnesses had  given  a\ntruthful account of the occurrence and the appellant&#x27;s uncle\nhad  actually  participated in the commission of  the  crime\nalong  with  the appellant. In other words, the\t High  Court\ncame to the conclusion that the acquittal of the appellant&#x27;s\nuncle was erroneous but since there was no appeal  preferred\nby  the\t State\tit could not interfere with  that  order  of\nacquittal.  It,\t however, came to the  conclusion  that\t the\ncrime  was committed by the appellant and his uncle in\tfur-\ntherance  of  their common intention and  accordingly  main-\ntained\tthe conviction of the appellant under  <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_54\">section\t302</a>,\nIPC, with the aid of <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_55\">section 34</a>, IPC. Before this Court\t the\nappellant  contended that on the acquittal of his uncle\t the\nsharing\t of common intention disappeared and the High  Court\nwas not justified in invoking\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">21</span>\n<a href=\"/doc/94346/\" id=\"a_56\">section 34</a> for maintaining the conviction against him  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_57\">section 302</a>, IPC. This Court while dealing with this submis-\nsion held that in the matter of appreciation of evidence the\npowers\tof  the Appellate Court are as wide as that  of\t the\nTrial  Court and the High Court was, therefore, entitled  in\nlaw  to review the entire evidence and to arrive at its\t own\nconclusion about the facts and circumstances emerging there-\nfrom. To put it differently, this Court came to the  conclu-\nsion  that the High Court was not bound by the\tappreciation\nof  the evidence made by the Trial Court and it was free  to\nreach  its own conclusions as to the proof or  otherwise  of\nthe circumstances relied upon by the prosecution on a review\nof  the evidence of the prosecution witnesses.\tThis  Court,\ntherefore,  held  that when several persons are\t alleged  to\nhave  committed\t an offence in furtherance of  their  common\nintention  and all except one are acquitted, it is  open  to\nthe Appellate Court under Sub-section (1)(b) of section\t 386\nof the code to find out on a reappraisal of the evidence who\nwere the persons involved in the commission of the crime and\nalthough it could not interfere with the order of  acquittal\nin  the absence of a State appeal it was entitled to  deter-\nmine  the actual offence committed by the convicted  person.\nWhere  on the reappreciation of the evidence  the  Appellate\nCourt  comes  to the conclusion that the appellant  and\t the\nacquitted  accused were both involved in the  commission  of\nthe crime, the Appellate Court can record a conviction\twith\nthe  the aid of <a href=\"/doc/94346/\" id=\"a_58\">section 34</a> notwithstanding the acquittal  of\nthe co-accused the appellate Court cannot reverse the  order\nof acquittal in the absence of a State appeal, it cannot  at\nthe same time be hedged by the appreciation of the  evidence\nby the lower court if that appreciation of evidence is found\nto be erroneous. This Court, therefore, pointed out that  in\nsuch  a fact-situation it is open to the Appellate Court  to\nrecord\ta finding of guilt with the aid of <a href=\"/doc/94346/\" id=\"a_59\">section  34</a>\tnot-\nwithstanding  the  acquittal  of the  co-accused  since\t the\nEnglish doctrine of repugnancy on the face of record has  no\napplication  in this country as we are governed by  our\t own\nstatutory  law. On this ratio this Court confirmed the\tcon-\nviction\t of the appellant under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_60\">section 302</a>, IPC,  but\twith\nthe aid of <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_61\">section 34</a>, IPC. The fact-situation before us  is\nmore or less similar.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"247105\" id=\"span_23\">Several decisions were cited in support of the  conten-\ntion  that where two named persons are charged for the\tcom-\nmission\t of an offence with the aid of <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_62\">section 34</a>,  IPC\t and\none of them is acquitted the other cannot be convicted\twith\nthe  aid  of <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_63\">section 34</a>, IPC. Dealing with  these  decisions\nthis Court observed in <a href=\"/doc/247105/\" id=\"a_64\">Brathi</a>&#x27;s case that all the  decisions\nrelied on were distinguishable on the ground that in none of\nthem  the Appellate Court was shown to have  disagreed\twith\nthe  Trial Court&#x27;s appreciation of evidence but on the\tcon-\ntrary the Appellate\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">22</span>\nCourt had proceeded on the footing that the appreciation  of\nevidence  by the Trial Court was correct. We think that\t the\ncases  on  which Mr. Lalit has placed reliance can  also  be\ndistinguished on the same ground.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">    In\tBaikuntha Nath Chaudhury&#x27;s case the evidence of\t two\neye  witnesses PWs 9 and 10 was to the effect  that  accused\nNos.  1 and 2 had killed their brother with the active\tpar-\nticipation of accused No. 3, their mother. According to\t the\nprosecution  accused  No. 2, the appellant, had\t called\t the\ndeceased  tohis house and while he was there accused  No.  1\ninflicted two lathi blows which proved fatal. The dead\tbody\nwas  then  put m a gunny bag supplied by accused No.  3\t and\ndrowned\t into a nearby tank. The three accused persons\twere\ncharged under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_65\">sections 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_66\">34</a>, and <a href=\"/doc/386021/\" id=\"a_67\">201</a>, IPC. The Trial Court\nacquitted  accused No. 3 but found the other two guilty.  On\nappeal the High Court acquitted accused No. 1 rejecting\t the\nprosecution  evidence in regard to his involvement but\tcon-\nfirmed the conviction of accused No. 2 under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_68\">section 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_69\">34</a>,\nIPC, though the fatal injuries were inflicted by the acquit-\nted  accused No. 1. It will thus be noticed that on a  reap-\npreciation of evidence by the High Court accused No. 1\tcame\nto  be\tacquitted although he was stated to have  given\t the\nfatal  lathi  blows while his brother,\tthe  appellant,\t was\nconvicted  on  the  same evidence.  This  Court,  therefore,\nconcluded that if the evidence of the two eye witnesses were\nto  be accepted, accused No. 1 could not be acquitted  since\naccording  to them it was he who had given the\tfatal  blows\nwhile  the  appellant had merely caught hold  of  him.\tThis\nCourt,\ttherefore, observed in paragraph 12 of the  judgment\nthat if the occurrence spoken to by PWs 9 and lois accepted,\nthe appellant will be constructively liable for his involve-\nment, though the fatal injuries were inflicted by his broth-\ner. In that case his brother will also be guilty of the said\noffence.  But since the High Court had acquitted  the  first\naccused\t it  meant that the High Court did  not\t accept\t the\nevidence  of  PWs 9 and 10 in regard to the  incident.\tThis\nCourt  did not come to the conclusion that the High  Court&#x27;s\nappreciation  of evidence in regard a accused No.1  was\t not\nproper. In fact it did not examine the case from that  point\nof view but held that since the High Court had not  accepted\nthe evidence of PWs 9 and 10 in regard to the part played by\nthe  acquitted\taccused, the appellant could not  have\tbeen\nconvicted  on  of the same appreciation\t of  evidence.\tThis\nbecomes clear on a close reading of paragraphs 12 and 13  of\nthe judgment. Similarly in the case\tof Kasturi Lal\tthis\nCourt  came to the conclusion that the reasons given by\t the\nHigh  Court for distinguishing the case of Kasturi Lal\tfrom\nthat of Khazan Singh and Gurdial Singh were not correct and,\ntherefore&#x27;, it was not justified in convicting Kasturi\tLal.\nSo, when the case of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">23</span>\nKasturi\t Lal was not distinguishable from that of the  above\ntwo,  this    Court felt that the High Court erred  in\tcon-\nvicting\t Kasturi Lal. It will thus be seen that\t this  Court\ncame  to the conclusion that the reasons Which weighed\twith\nthe  High Court for the distinction drawn were\tnot  correct\nand hence the conviction of Kasturi Lal &#x27;had to be set aside\nThis decision also does not help the appellant. In  Chandub-\nhai&#x27;s case the prosecution relied on the testimony of PWs 1,\n5  and 6 &#x27;Both the courts below found their testimony to  be\nunreliable  in\tseveral\t particulars and  acquired  the\t co-\naccused of the appellant in two stages. This Court concluded\nthat  the appellant&#x27;s case could not be\t distinguished\tfrom\nthat  of his two acquitted companions insofar as  the  reli-\nability\t of the ocular evidence of three eye  witnesses\t was\nconcerned. It was in the said circumstances that this  Court\nthought\t that the conviction of the appellant under  <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_70\">section\n302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_71\">34</a>,\t IPC  was  not justified,  particularly,  after\t the\nevidence of the three witnesses was found to be\t unreliable.\nthis  also,  therefore, is not a case  where  the  Appellate\nCourt disagreed with the appreciation of the evidence by the\nTrial Court and came to a different conclusion regarding the\nparticipation  of others in the commission of the crime.  In\nSukh  Ram&#x27;s  case  to which one of us (Ahmadi.\t J.)  was  a\nparty,\tthis  Court interferred with the conviction  of\t the\nappellant  recorded with the aid of <a href=\"/doc/94346/\" id=\"a_72\">section 34</a> by  the\tHigh\nCourt  because\ton the facts found proved  on  evidence\t the\nconviction  of the appellant could not be sustained  on\t the\nacquittal  of the co-accused on the same set of\t established\nfacts. This Court on its own did not come to the  conclusion\nthat  the  acquittal of Gokul was not well-founded  as\tHigh\nCourt&#x27;s\t appreciation  of evidence was not correct.  Had  it\ncome to that conclusion it could have recorded a  conviction\nof the appellant under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_73\">section 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_74\">34</a>, IPC,  notwithstanding\nthe  acquittal of Gokul. Therefore, all the aforesaid  cases\nare clearly distinguishable from the facts of Brathi&#x27;s\tcase\nwhere the High Court had clearly departed from the apprecia-\ntion of the evidence by the Trial Court and had reached\t own\nconclusion  in\tregard\tto the proof of\t various  facts\t and\ncircumstances  relied on by the prosecution. We are,  there-\nfore. in respectful agreement with the distinction drawn  by\nthis Court on the ground that in none of the cases cited  on\nbehalf\tof  the appellant it was shown\tthat  the  Appellate\nCourt had disagreed with the appreciation of evidence by the\nTrial  Court and the conclusion of facts  and  circumstances\nrecorded by it.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"939953\" id=\"span_26\">Does the decision in <a href=\"/doc/939953/\" id=\"a_75\">Krishna Govind Patii</a> (supra)- take\na different view?</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"247105\" id=\"span_27\">It is true that the attention of the Bench\nwhich  disposed\t of <a href=\"/doc/247105/\" id=\"a_76\">Brathi</a>&#x27;s case was not  invited  to\tthis\ndecision.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"247105\" id=\"span_28\">But, in our opinion, this decision does not take a\nview inconsistent with the <a href=\"/doc/247105/\" id=\"a_77\">ratio <a href=\"/doc/247105/\" id=\"a_78\">laid down in</a></a>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">24</span>\n<a href=\"/doc/247105/\" id=\"a_79\">Brathi</a>&#x27;s  case. The facts reveal that Krishna  Govind  Patil\nand three others were put up for trial for the murder of one\nVishwanath.

Accused\nNos. 1, 3 and 4 pleaded an alibi while accused No. 2  raised\nthe  plea of private defence. The Trial Court acquitted\t all\nthe  accused  on the ground that the  prosecution  witnesses\nwere not speaking the truth and the version of accused No. 2\nwas a probable one. The State appealed against the order  of\nacquittal under section 302/<a href=\"/doc/94346/\" id=\"a_83\">34</a>, but not against the  acquit-\ntal  under  <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_84\">section 302</a>, IPC. The High Court  confirmed\t the\nacquittal of accused Nos. 1, 3 and 4 on the ground that\t the\nevidence regarding their participation in the commission  of\nthe  crime was doubtful but convicted accused No. 2  on\t the\nground\tthat one or more of them might have participated  in\nthe  commission\t of the offence. Accused No.  2,  therefore,\npreferred  an appeal to this Court and contended  that\twhen\nthree  of  the four named persons were\tacquitted  the\tHigh\nCourt  was not justified in convicting him on the  basis  of\nconstructive liability. This Court held that before a  Court\ncan  convict  a person under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_85\">section 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_86\">34</a>,  IPC,  it\tmust\nrecord\ta  definite finding that the said person  had  prior\nconsultation  with one or more other persons, named  or\t un-\nnamed, for committing the offence. When three of the accused\ncame to be acquitted on the ground that the evidence was not\nacceptable  or\ton  the ground that they  were\tentitled  to\nbenefit of doubt, in law it meant that they did not partici-\npate in the offence. It was further held that the effect  of\nthe acquittal of the three  co-accused is that they did\t not\nco-jointly  and with the appellant commit the murder.  These\nobservations  have  to be read in the context of  the  facts\nstated\tabove.\tThe  High Court on an  appreciation  of\t the\nevidence, came to a definite conclusion that accused Nos. 1,\n3 and 4 had not participated in the commission of the crime.\nOn  that appreciation of the evidence the High\tCourt  could\nnot have come to the conclusion that any of those  acquitted\naccused was privy to the crime even for the limited  purpose\nof convicting the appellant with the aid of <a href=\"/doc/94346/\" id=\"a_87\">section 34</a>. This\nagain is not a case where the Appellate Court disagreed with\nthe  appreciation of evidence and reached a conclusion\tdif-\nferent\tfrom the conclusion recorded by the Trial  Court  in\nregard\tto the participation of the other  co-accused.</span>\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"247105\" id=\"span_30\">This\ndecision is also distinguishable on the same ground as\tthis\nCourt distinguished the other decisions in <a href=\"/doc/247105/\" id=\"a_88\">Brathi</a>&#x27;s case. We\nare, therefore, of the opinion that the omission to refer to\nthis decision does not render the decision in Brathi&#x27;s\tcase\nper  incuriam.</span>\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"247105\" id=\"span_31\">We are, therefore, in  respectful  agreement\nwith the law explained in <a href=\"/doc/247105/\" id=\"a_89\">Brathi</a>&#x27;s case.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_22\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"247105\" id=\"span_32\">Coming now to the facts of this case the Trial Court acquit-\nted the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">25</span>\nco-accused  but convicted the appellant under  <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_90\">section\t302</a>,\nIPC. The High Court has confirmed that conviction. Mr. Lalit\nis right when he says that the prosecution evidence does not\ndisclose  that the fatal blow which caused injury No. 1\t was\ngiven  by the appellant. Inherent of this submission is\t the\nassumption  that the fatal blow was given by  someone  else.\nThat establishes the fact that more that one person partici-\npated  in  the commission of the crime. We have also  on  an\nindependent  appreciation of the evidence of the  three\t eye\nwitnesses, namely, PW 1 Komal Chand, PW 3 Kishan Lal and  PW\n4  Ramesh, come to the conclusion that several\tpersons\t had\nparticipated in the commission of the crime. The failure  on\nthe part of the prosecution witnesses PWs 3 and 4 to identi-\nfy  the others does not alter the situation. We are, on\t the\nother hand, convinced from the evidence of PW 1 Komal  Chand\nthat some of the co-accused, particularly, Gunda, Parsu\t and\nGopal had participated in the commission of the crime. It is\nanother\t matter\t that in the absence of a State\t appeal\t the\nHigh  Court  could  not, nor can we,  interfere\t with  their\nacquittal,  but\t as rightly&#x27;pointed in\t<a href=\"/doc/247105/\" id=\"a_91\">Brathi</a>&#x27;s  case\tthis\nCourt is not bound by the facts found proved on the appreci-\nation of evidence by the courts below and is, in law,  enti-\ntled  to  reach its own conclusion different  from  the\t one\nrecorded  by the court&#x27;s below on a review of the  evidence.\nIn  that view of the matter we think that the conviction  of\nthe appellant can be sustained with the aid of <a href=\"/doc/94346/\" id=\"a_92\">section 34</a> or\n149, <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_93\">IPC</a>, as the case may be. In the present case we feel it\nsafe to confirm the conviction of the appellant with the aid\nof  <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_94\">section  34</a>, IPC. We, therefore, cannot agree  with\t the\nsubmission of the learned counsel for the appellant that  at\nbest the conviction can be recorded under <a href=\"/doc/724142/\" id=\"a_95\">section 324</a>,\tIPC.\nWe  confirm  the conviction of the appellant  under  <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_96\">section\n302</a>,  IPC, with the aid of <a href=\"/doc/94346/\" id=\"a_97\">section 34</a> and maintain the\tsen-\ntence awarded to him.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_23\">    For the above reasons we see no merit in this appeal and\ndismiss the same.\n</p><pre id=\"pre_2\">N.P.V.\t\t\t\t\t       Appeal\tdis-\nmissed.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">26</span>\n\n\n\n</pre>",
