The challenge in these petitions is to the orders dated 18 th February\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">CRL.LP. Nos. 257-262 of 2013                                 Page 2 of 14</span>\n 2013 passed by the learned Metropolitan Magistrate („MM‟) in\nComplaint Case Nos. 2207/1/07; 2208/1; 417/1; 2175A/1; 2190/1 and\n2175/1, filed by the Petitioner/Complainant Icon Buildcon Pvt. Ltd.\n(„IBPL‟) against Agarwal Developers Pvt. Ltd. („ADPL‟) and its\nDirectors who were arrayed as Accused Nos. 2, 3 and 4 in the\ncomplaints.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">2. The facts leading to the filing of the present petitions is that on 30 th\nDecember 2006, IBPL entered into an agreement to sell in respect of\nland admeasuring 24 bighas 12 biswas situated in village Khaira, Tehsil\nNajafgarh, New Delhi with the owners of the said land. On 2nd January\n2007, IBPL entered into two further separate agreements to sell in\nrespect of land measuring 10 bighas and 14 biswas and 45 bighas and 4\nbiswas respectively situated in the same village with the respective land\nowners. The total sale consideration was Rs.1.15 crores per acre. IBPL\npaid Rs.1,92,92,500 to the owners as part consideration. According to\nIBPL, ADPL offered to purchase the rights of IBPL under the\naforementioned three agreements with a profit of Rs.10 lakhs per acre.\nAccordingly, an agreement dated 24th February 2007 was entered into\nbetween IBPL and ADPL whereby all rights of IBPL under the three\nagreements to sell were transferred to ADPL.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_4\">3. It is stated that ADPL handed over the following six cheques dated\n24th February 2007 to IBPL towards the payment of the consideration\nunder the aforementioned agreements:\n</p><pre id=\"pre_2\">             Sl. No.           Cheque No.      Amount\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">CRL.LP.

The aforementioned six cheques were dishonoured and complaints\nwere filed under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 138</a> of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881\n(„<a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_2\">NI Act</a>‟) which were dismissed by six separate impugned orders of\nthe same date. Accordingly the present petitions have been filed\nseeking leave to appeal against the said judgments.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\">5. According to IBPL, ADPL had assured that the cheques when\npresented for payment will be honoured. IBPL states that when it first\npresented the cheques for payment, they were returned on 1 st March\n2007 with the remarks &quot;effects not yet cleared, please present again&quot;.\nWhen IBPL again presented the cheques, they were returned on 8 th\nMarch 2007 with the remarks „funds insufficient‟. When the cheques\nwere presented for payment on 29th March 2007 for the third time, they\nwere returned dishonoured with the remarks „payments stopped by the\ndrawer‟.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">6. The last dishonour of the cheques led IBPL to issue a legal notice\ndated 20th April 2007 thereby initiating the proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_3\">Section\n138</a> NI Act. When no payment was forthcoming the complaints were\nfiled in June 2007.\n</p>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">CRL.LP. Nos. 257-262 of 2013                          Page 4 of 14</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_8\"> 7. On behalf of IBPL, Mr. G.N. Bashista, an authorized representative\nwas examined as CW-1. Mr. Parvesh Garg, an officer of the Punjab\nNational Bank, in which the account of IBPL was maintained, was\nexamined as CW-2. Mr. R.K. Saini, Junior Technical Assistant in the\noffice of Registrar of Companies („ROC‟) was examined as CW-3. Mr.\nVipin Kumar Singh, an officer of the ICICI Bank on which the\nimpugned cheques were drawn and with whom ADPL‟s account was\nmaintained was examined as CW-4.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_9\">8. When the incriminating evidence was put to the Respondents under\nSection 313 Cr PC, they denied the allegations. On behalf of the\nRespondents, Mr. Rajiv Kumar Pandey, who was working as an\nAccountant with ADPL was examined as DW-1. Mr. Sarjit Singh,\nPatwari from Tehsil Najafgarh, South West District, New Delhi, was\nexamined as DW-2. He brought the records of the property in question\nand proved that an order had been passed by the SDM requiring status\nquo to be maintained and that the said status quo was in force. Mr.\nNitin Kumar, Junior Judicial Assistant of this Court was examined as\nDW-3. He placed on record the order sheets in CS (OS) No. 416 of\n2007. He confirmed that the said suit has been filed on 2 nd March 2007\nand that the court fee filed in the said suit bears the date as 27 th\nFebruary 2007. In his cross-examination, he confirmed that the first\ndate of hearing was 5th March 2007. Mr. Satbir, Property Dealer was\nexamined as DW-4. He confirmed that the three agreements to sell\nwere executed between IBPL and the villagers in respect of the land in\nquestion and that the said agreements were valid till 15th-17th February\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">CRL.LP. Nos. 257-262 of 2013                          Page 5 of 14</span>\n 2007. He stated that IBPL failed to get the sale deeds registered in their\nfavour.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">9. From an analysis of the testimonies of CW-1 and CW-4, the trial\nCourt came to the conclusion that the three agreements between IBPL\nand the land owners (Ex.P-2 to Ex.P-4) were executed at different\npoints in time and at different places and that they did not bear\nsignatures of any official of IBPL. Further, the trial Court held that\ncertain conditions were to be fulfilled by both the parties under the\nagreements to sell for IBPL to get transferable rights in respect of the\nproperties in question. However, it had nowhere been shown on record\nthat the parties performed their respective obligations thereunder. With\nthe land owners not obtaining a „no objection certificate‟ („NOC‟) from\nthe concerned authorities, the question of vesting of any right or title to\nthe properties in question in favour of IBPL under the three agreements\ndid not arise. Therefore, at the time when the cheques in question were\nissued no legally enforceable liability arose. It was concluded by the\nlearned trial Court that the cheques were not issued for discharging of\nlegal enforceable liability. Finally, the trial Court also held that the\nlegal notice did not appear to be served upon the address of the accused\npersons and, therefore, there was no proper service of the notice upon\nthem under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 138</a> NI Act. Consequently, the Respondents were\nacquitted of the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 138</a> NI Act.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_11\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1438532\" id=\"span_5\">10. Mr. Ankit Jain, learned counsel for IBPL submitted that the trial\nCourt committed a grievous error in holding that on the date of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">CRL.LP. Nos. 257-262 of 2013                             Page 6 of 14</span>\n issuance of the cheques, i.e., 24th February 2007 no legally enforceable\nliability had arisen. Relying on the decision of the Supreme Court in\n<a href=\"/doc/1438532/\" id=\"a_6\">M.M.T.C. Limited v. Medchl Chemicals &amp; Pharma (P) Limited</a> AIR\n2002 SC 182, Mr. Jain submitted that even though the cheques were\ndishonoured by reason of stop payment instructions, the offence under\n<a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 138</a> NI Act would still be attracted. By virtue of <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 138</a>\nread with <a href=\"/doc/268919/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 139</a> NI Act, the Court was required to presume that\nthe cheques in question were received by the holder for the discharge of\na legally enforceable liability, though this was a rebuttable\npresumption. The accused had to show that (i) there were sufficient\nfunds in the account to clear the amount of the cheques at the time of\ntheir presentation and (ii) that the stop payment instruction had been\nissued for valid and bona fide cause including that there was no\nexisting debt or liability at the time of presentation of the cheques for\nencashment. It is submitted that, in the present case, on the first\noccasion when the cheques were presented for payment they were\nreturned dishonoured for insufficient funds and, therefore, the first\nrequirement was not met.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"193064100\" id=\"span_7\">Relying on the decision of the Supreme Court\nin <a href=\"/doc/193064100/\" id=\"a_10\">Laxmi Dyechem v. State of Gujarat</a> 195 (2012) DLT 111 (SC),\nlearned counsel for the Petitioner submitted that the holder of the\ncheque should be presumed to have received the cheque for discharge\nof debt or other liability and that unless the contrary was proved, the\ndrawer of the cheque had to demonstrate that he had bona fide reasons\nto stop the payment. It is submitted that in the present case the reason\nfor stopping the payment was not bona fide. On the date the cheques\nwere issued, i.e., 24th February 2007, there was no doubt as regards the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">CRL.LP. Nos. 257-262 of 2013                           Page 7 of 14</span>\n rights of IBPL to title to the properties in question which rights IBPL\nagreed to sell to ADPL.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_12\">11. Countering the above submissions, Mr. Sanjay Manchanda, learned\ncounsel for the Respondents, submitted that the land in question was\nrepresented at the time of the agreement dated 24th February 2007 to be\nfree from encumbrances. However, as deposed by DW-2, an order had\nbeen passed by the SDM on 16th January 2007 directing maintenance of\nstatus quo. The third party with whom the agreements to sell had been\nentered into with respect to the very same land had filed CS (OS) No.\n461 of 2007 in which an order was passed on 5 th March 2007 by this\nCourt restraining the land owners from creating any third party interest\nin the properties in question. The evidence of DW-4 further showed\nthat Mr.R.C.Agarwal, Director of ADPL had come to know of the\ndispute between the villagers and the third party and had been\nrequesting IBPL not to present the cheques in question. It had also\ncome in the evidence of CW-1 and CW-4 the IBPL had unilaterally cut\na para of the agreement dated 24th February 2007 and had failed to hand\nover the originals of the Agreements between the villagers and the\nIBPL and this was in breach of the agreement dated 24th February 2007.\nIt is submitted that the fact that IBPL did not issue any notice to the\nvillagers requiring compliance of the three agreements and seeking to\ntransfer its inchoate rights in the properties in question to ADPL\nshowed that IBPL in fact had no valid transferable right in the\nproperties in question which could be transferred to ADPL. Therefore,\neven assuming ADPL paid IBPL the amounts of the dishonoured\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">CRL.LP. Nos. 257-262 of 2013                           Page 8 of 14</span>\n cheques, IBPL was in no position to ensure that ADPL got the right,\ntitle and interest in the properties in question free from encumbrances.\nIn the circumstances, the issuance by ADPL of stop payment\ninstructions in respect of the cheques in question was bona fide.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">12. The Supreme Court in a series of decisions has dealt with the\nquestion of dishonour of cheques due to stop payment instructions. In\nthe present case, on the first occasion when the cheques were returned\ndishonoured due to insufficient funds, IBPL did not initiate any action\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 138</a> NI Act. It is only after the dishonour of the cheque\non the third occasion on 29th March 2007 on account of the stop\npayment instructions that IBPL decided to initiate action under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_12\">Section\n138</a> NI Act. Therefore, for all practical purposes, the present cases must\nbe treated as belonging to the category where the dishonour of the\ncheques was on account of stop payment instructions.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">13. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1438532\" id=\"span_10\">In <a href=\"/doc/1438532/\" id=\"a_13\">M.M.T.C. Limited v. Medchl Chemicals &amp; Pharma (P) Limited</a>\n(supra), the Supreme Court clarified that dishonour on account of stop\npayment instructions would also be covered under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 138</a> NI Act\nand that presumption under <a href=\"/doc/268919/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 139</a> NI Act would be attracted even\nin such a case. However, it was clarified that the said presumption is\nrebuttable. As long as the Respondents were able to show that the stop\npayment instructions were issued for bona fide reasons, no liability\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 138</a> NI Act would be attracted.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1438532\" id=\"span_11\">As far as the second\nrequirement i.e., the drawer having to show that as on the date of the\npresentation of the cheques the fund in its account was sufficient to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">CRL.LP. Nos. 257-262 of 2013                            Page 9 of 14</span>\n honour the cheques, it is seen that it was in context of the facts in\n<a href=\"/doc/1438532/\" id=\"a_17\">M.M.T.C. Limited v. Medchl Chemicals &amp; Pharma (P) Limited</a>. In the\npresent case, however, IBPL did not urge before the trial Court that the\noffence under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 138</a> NI Act was attracted due to insufficient\nfunds. The proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 138</a> NI Act were initiated only\nwhen the cheques when presented for the third time on 29 th March 2007\nwere dishonoured on account of the stop payment instructions. No\nquestion was asked of the defence witnesses as to whether on the date\nof the presentation of the cheques in question for third time on 29 th\nMarch 2007, the balance in the accounts of ADPL was sufficient to\nhonour the cheques.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">14. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"193064100\" id=\"span_13\">In <a href=\"/doc/193064100/\" id=\"a_20\">Laxmi Dyechem v. State of Gujarat</a> (supra), the issue was\naddressed in the context of dishonour of the cheque due to closure of\nthe account.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"150051\" id=\"span_14\">After referring to the decision of the Supreme Court in\n<a href=\"/doc/150051/\" id=\"a_21\">Rangappa v. Sri Mohan</a> (2010) 11 SCC 441, it was held that &quot;even in\nsuch cases, the question whether or not there was a lawfully\nrecoverable debt or liability for discharge whereof the cheque was\nissued would be a matter that the trial Court will examine having regard\nto the evidence adduced before it and keeping in view the statutory\npresumption that unless rebutted the cheque is presumed to have been\nissued for a valid consideration&quot;. In the concurring judgment of Gyan\nSudha Misra, J. it was further clarified as under:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">         &quot;7. As already noted, the Legislature intends to punish only\n         those who are well aware that they have no amount in the bank\n         and yet issue a cheque in discharge of debt or liability which\n         amounts to cheating and not punish those who bona fide issues\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">CRL.LP. Nos. 257-262 of 2013                           Page 10 of 14</span>\n          the cheque and in return gets cheated giving rise to disputes\n         emerging from breach of agreement and hence contractual\n         violation. To illustrate this, there may be a situation where the\n         cheque is issued in favour of a supplier who delivers the goods\n         which is found defective by the consignee before the cheque is\n         encashed or a post-dated cheque towards full and final payment\n         to a builder after which the apartment owner might notice\n         breach of agreement for several reasons. It is not uncommon\n         that in that event the payment might be stopped bona fide by the\n         drawer of the cheque which becomes the contentious issue\n         relating to breach of contract and hence the question whether\n         that would constitute an offence under the <a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_22\">NI Act</a>. There may\n         be yet another example where a cheque is issued in favour of a\n         hospital which undertakes to treat the patient by operating the\n         patient or any other method of treatment and the doctor fails to\n         turn up and operate and in the process that patient expires even\n         before the treatment is administered. Thereafter, if the payment\n         is stopped by the drawer of the cheque, the obvious question\n         would arise as to whether that would amount to an offence\n         under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act by stopping the payment\n         ignoring <a href=\"/doc/268919/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 139</a> which makes it mandatory by\n         incorporating that the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act\n         is rebuttable. Similarly, there may be innumerable situations\n         where the drawer of the cheque for bona fide reasons might\n         issue instruction of „stop payment‟ to the bank in spite of\n         sufficiency of funds in his account.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">         8. What is wished to be emphasized is that matters arising out\n         of „stop payment‟ instruction to the bank although would\n         constitute an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act since this\n         is no longer res-integra, the same is an offence subject to the\n         provision of <a href=\"/doc/268919/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 139</a> of the Act and hence, where the\n         accused fails to discharge his burden of rebuttal by proving that\n         the cheque could be held to be a cheque only for discharge of a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">CRL.LP. Nos. 257-262 of 2013                            Page 11 of 14</span>\n          lawful debt, the offence would be made out. Therefore, the\n         cases arising out of stop payment situation where the drawer of\n         cheques has sufficient funds in his account and yet stops\n         payment for bona fide reasons, the same cannot be put on par\n         with other variety of cases where the cheque has bounced on\n         account of insufficiency of funds or where it exceeds the\n         amount arranged to be paid from that account, since <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_28\">Section\n         138</a> cannot be applied in isolation ignoring <a href=\"/doc/268919/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 139</a> which\n         envisages a right of rebuttal before an offence could be made\n         out under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 138</a> of the Act as the Legislature already\n         incorporates the expression &quot;unless the contrary is proved&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_16\">         which means that the presumption of law shall stand and unless\n         it is rebutted or disproved, the holder of a cheque shall be\n         presumed to have received the cheque of the nature referred to\n         in <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act, for the discharge of a debt or other\n         liability. Hence, unless the contrary is proved, the presumption\n         shall be made that the holder of a negotiable instrument is\n         holder in due course.&quot;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"77590271\" id=\"span_17\">15. Recently in <a href=\"/doc/77590271/\" id=\"a_32\">Indus Airways P. Ltd. v. Magnum Aviation P. Ltd.</a>\n2014 (4) SCALE 645, the Supreme Court held that there is a fine\ndistinction between the civil liability and criminal liability under\n<a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 138</a> NI Act. It was observed as under:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">       &quot;If at the time of entering into a contract, it is one of the\n       conditions of the contract that the purchaser has to pay the\n       amount in advance and there is breach of such condition then\n       purchaser may have to make good the loss that might have\n       occasioned to the seller but that does not create a criminal\n       liability under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 138</a>. For a criminal liability to be made\n       out under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 138</a>, there should be legally enforceable debt\n       or other liability subsisting on the date of drawal of the cheque.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">CRL.LP.

The drawer of the cheque can seek to rebut\nthe presumptions by showing on a preponderance of probabilities i.e.,\nthat the stop payment instructions issued were bona fide.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">17. In the present case, the depositions of CW-1 and CW-4 reveal that\nIBPL was aware even on the date of the agreement dated 24 th February\n2007 between it and ADPL that the properties in question were the\nsubject matter of litigation. As spoken to by DW-2, there was a\nrestraint order passed by the SDM on 16th January 2007 restraining the\nvillagers from creating any third party interest. By the time the cheques\nwere presented for payment for the third time, a restraint order was also\npassed by this Court on 5th March 2007 in CS (OS) No. 416 of 2007.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">18. It is submitted by Mr. Jain that on the date the cheques were issued,\ni.e., 24th February 2007, there was a legally enforceable liability. On the\nfacts of the present case, however, it is seen that on the date when the\ncheques in question were issued, it was not possible for IBPL to convey\nto ADPL a valid transferable right in the properties in question under\nthe three agreements for payment of consideration. Even on the date of\nthe three agreements, IBPL‟s rights were inchoate. IBPL‟s rights to the\nland in question were contingent upon both the parties to the three\nagreements performing their respective obligations. With the NOC\nhaving not been obtained by the villagers, it cannot be said that rights\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">CRL.LP.

Even on the date of\nissuance of the cheques, i.e., 24th February 2007, the position was no\ndifferent.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_21\">19. In the above circumstances, if on coming to know of the above\ndifficulties, the Respondents had issued stop payment instructions, it\ncannot be said to lack in bona fides.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_22\">20. For the aforesaid reasons, the Court finds that the conclusion\nreached by the trial Court that the Respondents could not be held guilty\nfor the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 138</a> NI Act does not suffer from any legal\ninfirmity.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_23\">21.
