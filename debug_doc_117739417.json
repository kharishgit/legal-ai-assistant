Briefly, the facts relevant for the purpose of this appeal are as\n\nfollows:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">2.1 The marriage between Appellant No. 1 and Dr. M. Amali Victoria\n\n(hereinafter referred to as “deceased”) was solemnised on 08.09.2005\n\nand a male child was born out of wedlock in the year 2007. On the\n\nprofessional front, both parties are doctors. Appellant No. 1 was\n\ninformed on 05.11.2014 that the deceased had collapsed in the\n\nbathroom of their home and was non-responsive. Immediately, an\n\nambulance was called by the father of Appellant No. 1. On reaching the\n\nsite of the incident, Appellant No. 1 found the deceased having no pulse.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">Despite intervention from the neighbors of Appellant No. 1 who were\n\ndoctors, the deceased could not be resuscitated and passed away on\n\n05.11.2014. Post mortem of the body was conducted on 06.11.2014 and\n\nthe cause of death was asphyxia due to external compression of the\n\nneck.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                   2</span>\n\f2.2 On 06.11.2014, The Respondent Police registered FIR No. 1865 of\n\n2015 at Police Station K2, Ayanavaram, District Kilpauk, Chennai based\n\non the statement of Appellant No. 1 owing to the unnatural death of the\n\ndeceased under <a href=\"/doc/411677/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 174</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973\n\n(hereinafter referred to as “<a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_10\">Cr.P.C</a>”).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">\n\n2.3 After 3 weeks of the death of the deceased, PW-1(the mother of\n\nthe deceased) lodged a complaint against the Appellant No.1, Appellant\n\nNo. 2(mother-in-law), and the father-in-law of the deceased for the\n\noffences punishable under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_11\">Sections 498A</a> and <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_12\">306</a> IPC. Thereafter, the\n\nFIR was converted from <a href=\"/doc/411677/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 174</a> Cr.P.C to <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_14\">Sections 498A</a> and <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_15\">306</a>\n\nIPC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">\n\n2.4 It was the case of the prosecution that the marriage of the\n\ndeceased with Appellant No. 1 was solemnised in the year 2005 and\n\nsince the deceased was not having a child for 1.5 years, the appellants\n\nabused her and compelled her to participate in the Pooja and on the\n\nrefusal of the same, she was threatened by the appellants that she\n\nwould die. Subsequently, the deceased gave birth to a male child\n\nnamed Rosando by caesarean in the year 2007. Further, the Appellant\n\nNo. 1 caused immense mental torture to the deceased by compelling\n\nher to have another child in spite of the fact that the deceased had a\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                     3</span>\n\fmiscarriage with her second pregnancy. The deceased was made to do\n\nall the domestic household work and was subjected to continuous\n\ncruelty at the hands of the appellants. Due to the same reason, the\n\ndeceased was driven to commit suicide on 05.11.2014.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">3.    Thereafter, on completion of the investigation, charge sheet was\n\nfiled and cognizance was taken. Since the offences are triable by the\n\nCourt of Session, the said case being SC No. 209 of 2016 was\n\ncommitted to Mahila Court, Chennai for trial.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_12\">4.    The Trial Court framed charges against the appellants for the\n\noffences under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_16\">Sections 498A</a> and <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_17\">306</a> IPC. The appellants pleaded not\n\nguilty and therefore they came to be tried for the aforesaid offence.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_13\">5.    In order to substantiate the case, the prosecution examined 15\n\nwitnesses. From side of the defence, no witnesses were examined. The\n\nstatement of the appellants was also recorded under Section 313 of\n\nCr.P.C.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_14\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">6.    The Trial Court, after analysing the statement made by the\n\nprosecution witness and evidence of the defence, vide judgment and\n\norder dated 26.03.2021 convicted the Appellants i.e., the husband and\n\nmother-in-law of the deceased for the offences under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_18\">Sections 498A</a> and\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                    <a href=\"/doc/1127741/\" id=\"a_19\">4</a></span>\n\f<a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_20\">306</a> IPC and were sentenced as stated herein above. The Trial Court\n\nacquitted the father-in-law of the deceased of all the charges.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_16\">7.   Challenging the judgment and order passed by the Trial Court, the\n\nAppellants filed Criminal Appeal No. 166 of 2021 before the High Court.\n\nThe same was dismissed with the observation that the Appellants have\n\ncommitted the offence under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_21\">Sections 498A</a> and <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_22\">306</a> IPC and the Trial\n\nCourt rightly appreciated the evidence and convicted the appellants\n\nherein. The Respondent police were directed to send the appellants to\n\nundergo the remaining period of sentence. Being aggrieved by the High\n\nCourt order, the appellants have preferred the present appeal.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_17\">8.   We have heard Mr. Kapil Sibal, Learned Senior Advocate\n\nappearing on behalf of the appellants and Mr. P.V.

Mr. Kapil Sibal, Learned Senior Advocate submitted that the\n\nallegations of cruelty have been made for the first time in the complaint\n\nmade by the mother of the deceased and there is not even a whisper of\n\nthese allegations in over 9 years of marriage by the deceased or her\n\nfamily. On the contrary, the relations between the Appellants and his\n\nfamily, and the deceased and her family were extremely cordial.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                    5</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_20\">\f10.   It was vehemently submitted that the deceased was suffering from\n\nbipolar disorder and this fact was not disclosed to the petitioner at the\n\ntime of marriage. In spite of the non-disclosure of the same, Appellant\n\nNo. 1 took good care of the deceased and it cannot be alleged that the\n\ndeceased committed suicide due to abetment by the Appellants.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_21\">11.

It was next submitted that there were no signs of animosity\n\nbetween the families when their statements were being recorded\n\nimmediately after the death of the deceased.

The intention of the legislature and\n                 the ratio of the cases decided by the Supreme\n                 Court is clear that in order to convict a person\n                 under <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 306</a> IPC there has to be a clear\n                 mens rea to commit the offence.

In cases of alleged abetment of suicide, there\n           must be a proof of direct or indirect act/s of incitement\n           to the commission of suicide. It could hardly be\n           disputed that the question of cause of a suicide,\n           particularly in the context of an offence of abetment of\n           suicide, remains a vexed one, involving multifaceted\n           and complex attributes of human behavior and\n           responses/reactions. In the case of accusation for\n           abetment of suicide, the Court would be looking for\n           cogent and convincing proof of the act/s of incitement\n           to the commission of suicide. In the case of suicide,\n           mere allegation of harassment of the deceased by\n           another person would not suffice unless there be such\n           action on the part of the accused which compels the\n           person to commit suicide; and such an offending\n           action ought to be proximate to the time of occurrence.\n           Whether a person has abetted in the commission of\n           suicide by another or not, could only be gathered from\n           the facts and circumstances of each case.\n           16.1. For the purpose of finding out if a person has\n           abetted commission of suicide by another; the\n           consideration would be if the accused is guilty of the\n           act of instigation of the act of suicide.

If the\n         persons who committed suicide had been\n         hypersensitive and the action of accused is otherwise\n         not ordinarily expected to induce a similarly\n         circumstanced person to commit suicide, it may not be\n         safe to hold the accused guilty of abetment of suicide.\n         But, on the other hand, if the accused by his acts and\n         by his continuous course of conduct creates a\n         situation which leads the deceased perceiving no\n         other option except to commit suicide, the case may\n         fall within the four-corners of <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 306</a> IPC. If the\n         accused plays an active role in tarnishing the self-\n         esteem and self-respect of the victim, which eventually\n         draws the victim to commit suicide, the accused may\n         be held guilty of abetment of suicide. The question of\n         mens rea on the part of the accused in such cases\n         would be examined with reference to the actual acts\n         and deeds of the accused and if the acts and deeds\n         are only of such nature where the accused intended\n         nothing more than harassment or snap show of anger,\n         a particular case may fall short of the offence of\n         abetment of suicide. However, if the accused kept on\n         irritating or annoying the deceased by words or deeds\n         until the deceased reacted or was provoked, a\n         particular case may be that of abetment of suicide.\n         Such being the matter of delicate analysis of human\n         behaviour, each case is required to be examined on its\n         own facts, while taking note of all the surrounding\n         factors having bearing on the actions and psyche of\n         the accused and the deceased.”\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_50\">27.

On Appeal, the High Court upheld the same. The operative\n\nportion of the judgment reads as under: -\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_59\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">         “16. Two things have to be proved by the prosecution\n         in order to sustain the appellants&#x27; conviction for the\n         offences under <a href=\"/doc/1868826/\" id=\"a_59\">Section 498(A)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_60\">306</a> IPC, as to\n         whether, the death of the deceased is unnatural and\n         as to whether the deceased committed suicide due to\n         harassment, inducement and abetment of the\n         appellants. In this case, as already stated, as per\n         the Medical evidence, it is clear that the victim\n         died unnaturally and the evidence of P.W.1 to P.W.3\n         proved that the appellants made harassment on\n         the victim and caused mental and physical cruelty.\n         Due to cruelty, the deceased has taken the\n         extreme step to end her life.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">         18.

In this case, P.W.1 is the mother of the\n         deceased and P.W.2 is the elder sister of the\n         deceased. There are no medical records produced on\n         the side of the appellants to show that the deceased\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">                                   18</span>\n\f         was mentally disordered person or she is having\n         tendency of committing suicide. However, the\n         evidence of P.W.1 to P.W.3 and P.W.10, would clearly\n         show that the deceased committed suicide due to the\n         continuous harassment and the mental cruelty made\n         by the appellants. Hence, the evidence of P.W.1 to\n         P.W.3 are reliable and trustworthy, which inspires the\n         confidence of this Court to convict the appellants.\n         Testimony of interested witness cannot be per se\n         discarded and the Court has to adopt careful approach\n         and analyse evidence to find out the cogency and\n         credibility. This Court does not find out any reason to\n         disbelieve the evidence of P.W.1 to P.W.3 and\n         evidence of P.W.2 was corroborated by the evidence\n         of P.W.10.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_61\">         20. A careful reading of the evidence of P.W.1 to P.W.3\n         and also the evidence of the Doctor who conducted\n         post-mortem proved that the victim was subjected to\n         harassment and cruelty made by the appellants. She\n         is well educated and working as a Psychiatrist in the\n         Government Mental Hospital, Kilpauk, she ended her\n         life by way of hanging. Therefore, this Court finds that\n         the appellants have committed the offence under\n         <a href=\"/doc/1868826/\" id=\"a_61\">Sections 498(A)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_62\">306</a> IPC and the learned trial\n         Judge rightly appreciated the evidence and convicted\n         the appellants and therefore, there is no merit in this\n         case and the appeal is liable to be dismissed.”\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_62\">34.   A bare perusal of the impugned judgment indicates that the High\n\nCourt erred in recording the finding that there is sufficient evidence for\n\nconvicting the appellants under <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_63\">Section 306</a> IPC losing sight of the fact\n\nthat there exists no evidence on record indicating that the deceased was\n\nmeted out with harassment by the appellants just before her death. It is\n\nwell-settled that not only there has to be evidence of continuous\n\nharassment, but there should be cogent evidence to establish a positive\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">                                   19</span>\n\faction by the accused which should more or less be proximate to the\n\ntime of occurrence, which action can said to have led or compelled the\n\nperson to commit suicide.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_63\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_64\">35.   In case at hand, not only the said positive action in close proximity\n\nto the time of suicide is absent but also there is no evidence for any\n\ncontinuous physical or mental torture meted out to the deceased by the\n\nappellants. On the contrary, appellant no. 1 himself took the deceased to\n\nconsult a psychiatrist just a day prior to this incident obviously with the\n\nintention to make her feel better. The said act can by no stretch of\n\nimagination be said to be any such act which may lead the deceased to\n\ncommit suicide. Further, the allegations made by PW-1 to PW-3 in their\n\nstatement with respect to continuous harassment and torture of the\n\ndeceased by the appellants just after the marriage is not worthy of being\n\nrelied upon and has to be taken with a pinch of salt on account of fact\n\nthat throughout their 9 years of marriage, there has never been any\n\ncomplaint or a whisper in this regard either by the deceased or her family\n\nmembers who appeared as prosecution witnesses. Even the deceased\n\nherself who was a qualified doctor never made any complaint in this\n\nregard. It is really hard to believe that a well-educated and self-reliant\n\nlady would take such things lying down for a substantially long period of\n\n9 years.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_65\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">                                    20</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_66\">\f36.   To convict a person under <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_64\">Section 306</a> IPC, there has to be clear\n\nmens rea to commit offence. It also requires an active act or direct act\n\nwhich leads deceased to commit suicide finding no other option and the\n\nact must be such reflecting intention of the accused to push deceased\n\ninto such a position that he commits suicide. The prosecution has to\n\nestablish beyond reasonable doubt that the deceased committed suicide\n\nand Appellant No. 1 abetted the commission of suicide of the deceased.\n\nIn the present case, both the elements are absent.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_67\">37.   Now, so far as conviction under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_65\">Section 498A</a> IPC is concerned,\n\nexcept the statement of the prosecution witnesses PW-1 to PW-3\n\nrecorded after the incident, there is no other evidence to establish the\n\nallegation of any demand of dowry or ill treatment meted out to the\n\ndeceased during her marriage. The fact that there were cordial relations\n\nbetween the families of Appellant No. 1 and the deceased is not\n\ndisputed.   The deceased committed suicide on 05.11.2014 and the\n\ncomplaint against the appellants were filed on 24.11.2014 i.e., 3 weeks\n\nafter the death of the deceased.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_68\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_69\">38.   This Court has time and again reiterated that before convicting an\n\naccused under <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_66\">Section 306</a> IPC, the Court must scrupulously examine\n\nthe facts and circumstances of the case and also assess the evidence\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">                                   21</span>\n\fadduced before it in order to find out whether cruelty and harassment\n\nmeted out to the victim had left the victim with no other alternative but to\n\nput an end to her life. It is also to be borne in mind that in cases of\n\nalleged abetment of suicide, there must be proof of direct or indirect acts\n\nof incitement to the commission of suicide. Merely on the allegation of\n\nharassment without their being any positive action proximate to the time\n\nof occurrence on the part of the accused which led or compelled the\n\nperson to commit suicide, conviction in terms of <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_67\">Section 306</a> IPC is not\n\nsustainable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_70\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_71\">39.   Prosecution in order to prove the guilt of accused/appellants\n\nproduced the following witnesses:\n</p>\n<pre id=\"pre_2\">              Mother of the deceased – PW-1\n              Sister of the deceased – PW-2\n              Brother of the deceased - PW-3\n              Carpenter who broke open the bathroom door - PW-4\n              servant maid working in the house - PW-5\n              AC mechanic who accompanied the carpenter - PW-6\n              Colleague of the deceased - PW-7\n              Colleague of the deceased - PW-8\n              Doctor who gave the treatment to the deceased on\n               04.11.2014 - PW-9\n              Doctor who conducted autopsy on the dead body -\n               PW-10\n              Doctor who declared the deceased as brought dead\n               on 05.11.2014 - PW-11\n              Doctor who treated the deceased on abortion of the\n               second child - PW-12\n              Auto driver - PW-13\n              Sub-Inspector of Police - PW-14\n              Inspector of Police who investigated the case – PW-15\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">                                     22</span>\n</pre><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_72\">\f40.   PW-1 to PW-3 are interested witnesses, still, PW-3 categorically\n\nstated that “the marriage between my sister Dr. Amali Victoria and Dr.\n\nBruno was a happy marriage”.

PW-9, Dr. Shalini is the Psychiatrist who had given treatment to the\n\ndeceased on 04.11.2014.        she had deposed that the deceased\n\nexpressed her disinterest in duty, complained of lack of sleep and not\n\nfeeling hungry and also had no interest over anything. Further, PW-9\n\nstated that these were the symptoms of depression. PW-9 in her\n\nsummary of treatment report dated 04.11.2014 stated that the deceased\n\nstated cause of sadness for the past 1 month was due to her posting at\n\nthe female ward @ IMH and she feels tired, is not interested in working,\n\npoor sleep pattern to name a few. Furthermore, it is pertinent to mention\n\nthat it was also noted in treatment summary by PW-9 that the deceased\n\nhad similar depressive illness in the past i.e., 1 st episode during MBBS\n\ncollege days, had attempted suicide, 2 nd episode post-partum and\n\npresent is the third episode. The deceased had suicidal ideas before\n\ngoing for the consultation with the psychiatrist on 04.11.2014 and the\n\nsame is evident from the summary of treatment. However, the evidence\n\nof PW-9 i.e., the psychiatrist has not been considered by the Courts\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">                                   23</span>\n\fbelow and conviction of the appellants were solely based on the oral\n\nevidence of PW-1 to PW-3.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_75\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_76\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"229273\" id=\"span_38\">42.    It is well settled that the Courts ought to be extremely careful in\n\nassessing the facts and circumstances of each case and the evidence\n\nadduced in the trial for the purpose of finding whether the cruelty meted\n\nout to the victim had in fact induced her to end the life by committing\n\nsuicide.
