The dispute  was settled by a\npatchwork mediation  but it  was of no avail. On the fateful\nday, the  complainant&#x27;s party were making merry with alcohol\nin the\thouse  of  the\tprosecution  witness  when  the\t 3rd\nappellant joined  them. His  unwelcome presence\t resulted in\nfrayed tempers,\t and beatings  of  the\t3rd  appellant.\t The\nlatter,\t bent\ton  reprisal   for  the\t  flagellation\t and\nhumilation, waited  till sundown  and  returned\t armed\twith\nfriends and  weapons. He  ignited the  attack by instigation\nand the\t 1st and  2nd appellants  fired with their guns as a\nresult of which 3 members of the complainants&#x27; party died on\nthe spot.  At this situation, PW 14 brought out his licensed\ngun from  his house, and thereupon both sides started firing\nand a number of persons sustained gun shot injuries on their\nperson. In  the midst  of this\tfiring, the lambardar of the\nvillage appeared  on the scene and made an attempt to pacify\nboth the  sides, but he also received gun shot injuries as a\nresult of which he died two days later. A fourth person made\na dying declaration that he had been shot by the appellants.\n     The Sessions  Court held  the appellants  guilty  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 302</a> I.P.C. and sentenced them to death, and the High\nCourt on appeal confirmed the sentence.\n     Allowing the appeal to this court,\n^\n     HELD: [Per Krishna Iyer &amp; Desai, JJ.]\n     1. Death  sentence on  death sentence  is\tParliament&#x27;s\nfunction. Interpretative  non-application of  death sentence\nwhen  legislative  alternatives\t exist\tis  within  judicial\ndiscretion. [1065B]\n     2.\t The   dignity\tof  man,  a  sublime  value  of\t the\nConstitution and  the heart of penelogical humanisation, may\nfind expression through culturisation of the judicial art of\ninterpretation and  choice from\t alternatives. If  the Court\nreads the  text of  s. 302  Penal Code,\t enlightened by\t the\nfundamental right  to life which the Founding Fathers of the\nConstitution made  manifest, the judicial oath to uphold the\nConstitution will unfold profound implications\n1060\nbeyond lip  service to\tForm VIII  of the Third Schedule and\nthis lofty  obligation and  cultural  Constitutional  behest\nvalidates the exploration of the meaning of meanings wrapped\nin the\tuncharted either/or  of the  text  of  s.  302\t<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_6\">IPC</a>.\n[1065E-F]\n     3. Courts\tread the Code, not in judicial cloisters but\nin the light of societal ethos. Nor does the humanism of our\nConstitution   holistically   viewed,\tsubscribe   to\t the\nhysterical assumption  or facile  illusion that a crime free\nsociety\t dawn\tif  hangman  and  firing  squads  were\tkept\nfeverishly busy. [1066A-B]\n     4. The  myopic view  that public  executions backed  by\njudicial sentences will perform the funeral of all criminals\nand  scare   away  potential   offenders   is\ta   die-hard\nsuperstition   of    sociologically   and    psychologically\nilliterate  legalism   which  sacrifices   cultural  values,\nconveniently turns  away from the history of the futility of\ncapital penalty over the ages and unconsciously violates the\nglobal reality\tthat half  the\tworld  has  given  up  death\npenalty, de  jure or  de facto,\t without added calamity, and\nthe other half is being educated out of this State practised\nlethal violence\t by powerful  human rights movements at once\nsecular and spiritual. [1067B-C]\n     5. The  jurisprudence of  sentencing in  Free India has\nbeen a\tCinderella and\tthe values  of our Constitution have\nnot  adequately\t  humanised  the   punitive  diagnostics  of\ncriminal courts,  which sometimes,  though rarely, remind us\nof the\ttorture some  and trigger-happy\t aberrations of\t the\nMiddle Ages  and some  gory geographic\tsegments, soaked  in\nretributive blood  and untouched  by the correctional karuna\nof our Constitutional culture. [1068G]\n     6. After  Ediga Annamas&#x27;s case [1974] 4 SCC 443 the law\nof punishment  under<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_7\"> s.\t 302</a> IPC has been largely settled by\nthis court and the High Courts are bound thereby. [1068H]\n     7. Rajendra  Prasad&#x27;s case\t [1979] 3  SCR 78 and Bishnu\nDeo Shaw&#x27;s  case [1979]\t 3 SCR\tp. 355 have indubitably laid\ndown the normative cynosure and until over ruled by a larger\nbench of  this court  that is the law of the land under <a href=\"/doc/882644/\" id=\"a_8\">Art.\n141.</a> To\t discard it  is to disobey the Constitution and such\nsubversiveness of the rule of law, in a crucial area of life\nand death,  will spell\tjudicial disorder. Today, the law is\nwhat Rajendra  Prasad, in  its majority\t judgment, has\tlaid\ndown and  that has  been done at unmistakable length. Willy-\nnilly, that  binds judges  and parties\talike. [1068H-1069A,\n1069C]\n     8. Counting  the casualties  is not  the main criterion\nfor sentencing\tto death,  nor recklessness  in the  act  of\nmurder. The  sole focus\t on the crime and the total farewell\nto  the\t  criminal  and\t his  social-personal  circumstances\nmutilate. sentencing justice. [1069B]\n     9. The  forensic  exercise\t at  the  sentencing  stage,\ndespite\t the  purposeful  s.  235(2)  <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_9\">Cr.P.C</a>.,\thas  been  a\nfunctional failure  because of the casual way the punishment\nfactors are  dealt with,  as if\t the nature of the crime was\nthe sole determinant of the punishment. In Rajendra Prasad&#x27;s\ncase it\t has been  explained how  the prosecution  must make\nout, by\t special factors,  why the  graver penalty should be\ninflicted. Evidence  may be  led and  arguments addressed by\nboth sides, but in practice<a href=\"/doc/1986933/\" id=\"a_10\"> s. 235(2)</a> has been frustratingly\nritualised. [1069D-E]\n1061\n     10. <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_11\">Section  302</a> of the Penal Code, read with<a href=\"/doc/324405/\" id=\"a_12\"> s. 354(3)</a>\nof the\tCriminal Procedure Code demands special reasons four\nawarding the graver sentence. [1070El\n     ll. Taking\t the cue  from the  English  legislation  on\nabolition,  the\t  majority  opinion   suggested\t that\tlife\nimprisonment which strictly means imprisonment for the whole\nof the\tman&#x27;s life  but in practice amounts to incarceration\nfor a  period between  10 and 14 years may, at the option of\nthe convicting\tcourt, be  subject to the condition that the\nsentence of  imprisonment shall\t last as  long as life lasts\nwhere  there   are  exceptional\t  indications  of  murderous\nrecidivism and\tthe community  cannot run  the risk  of\t the\nconvict\t being\t at  large.  This  takes  care\tof  judicial\napprehensions that  unless physically liquidated the culprit\nmay at some remote time repeat murder. [1071F-G]\n     12. The  gallows swallow,\tin most\t cases,\t the  social\ndissenter, the\tpolitical dissenter, the poor and the under-\nprivileged, the\t member of  minority groups  or one  who has\nturned tough  because of  broken homes,\t parental neglect or\nother undeserved adversities of childhood or later. Judicial\nerror leading  to innocent  men being  executed is  not\t too\nrecondite a  reality. Evidence\tin Court  and assessments by\njudges have human limitation. [1071H-1072Bl\n     13. A  Full Bench\tof the\tMadras High  Court in Athapa\nGoundan&#x27;s case\t(AIR 1937  Mad. 695) sentenced him to death.\nHe was\tduly executed as also several others on the ratio of\nthat ruling.  This Full\t Bench decision\t was, however, over-\nruled ten  years later\tby the\tPrivy Council in 1947 PC 67.\nHad it\tbeen done  before Goundan was gallowed many judicial\nhangings could have been halted. [1072C]\n     (A) In  the instant  case the  earlier provocation came\nfrom the  deceased&#x27;s side by beating up Appellant No. 3. The\nparties, including  the prosecution  group were tipsy. There\nhad been  antecedent  irrigation  irritation  between  them.\nThere was  no pre-planned,  well-laid attack,  hell-bent  on\nliquidating the enemy. [1069E]\n     (B) The  sentences of  death in  the present appeal are\nliable to be reduced to life imprisonment. [1071E]\n     (Per Sen, J. dissenting)\n     1. The question of abolition of capital punishment is a\ndifficult and  controversial subject, long and hotly debated\nand it\thas evoked  during the\tpast  two  centuries  strong\nconflicting views. [1072H]\n     2. The  question whether  the scope  of death  sentence\nshould be  curtailed or not is for the Parliament to decide.\nThe matter  is essentially  of political  expediency and, as\nsuch, it  is the  concern of  the statesmen, and, therefore,\nthe domain  of\tthe  Legislature  land\tnot  the  Judiciary.\n[1073A]\n     3. It  is not  within the\tprovince of this Court while\ndealing with  an appeal confined to sentence under <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_13\">Art. 136</a>,\nto curtail  the scope of death sentence under<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_14\"> s. 302</a> l.P.C.,\n1860 nor  is it\t constitutionally or legally permissible for\nthis Court  while hearing such an appeal to lay down that on\ngrounds of  compassion and humanism the sentence of death on\na conviction for murder under<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_15\"> s. 302</a>, as a rule of universal\napplication be substituted by a sentence\n1062\nof imprisonment for life, irrespective of the gravity of the\ncrime and  the\tsurrounding  circumstances  i.e.,  virtually\nabolish the extreme penalty. [1072G]\n     4. <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_16\">Section\t 302</a> I.P.C.,  1860 confers  upon the Court a\ndiscretion in the matter of the punishment to be imposed for\nan offence of murder and the Court has to choose between the\nsentence of  death and\ta sentence  of imprisonment for life\nwhile under  s. 354(3)\tCr. P.C., 1973 the Court is enjoined\nwith a\tduty to record &#x27;special reasons&#x27; in case the extreme\npenalty is  awarded. But  the  question\t whether  the  death\nsentence should\t be awarded  or not  must, be  left  to\t the\ndiscretion of  the Judge trying the accused and the question\nof sentence  must depend  upon the  facts and  circumstances\nobtaining in  each case. A sentence of death when passed, is\nsubject to confirmation by the High Court under<a href=\"/doc/796352/\" id=\"a_17\"> s. 366(1)</a> of\nthe Code. The accused also has a right of appeal to the High\nCourt under  s. 374(2)\tagainst the  sentence. Thereafter an\nappeal lies to this Court by special leave under <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_18\">Art. 136</a> on\nthe question  of sentence.  It would, therefore, be manifest\nthat  it   is  neither\t feasible  to\tdefine\tnor  legally\npermissible for\t this Court  to limit  or  circumscribe\t the\nconnotation of the expression &#x27;special reasons&#x27; occurring in<a href=\"/doc/203036/\" id=\"a_19\">\ns. 354(3)</a>  of the  Code so  as\tto  bring  about  a  virtual\nabolition of the death sentence. [1073B-E]\n     5. A  decision on a question of sentence depending upon\nthe facts  and circumstances of a particular case, can never\nbe regarded as a binding precedent, much less &#x27;law declared&#x27;\nwithin the  meaning of <a href=\"/doc/882644/\" id=\"a_20\">Art. 141</a> of the Constitution so as to\nbind all courts within the territory of India. [1073F]\n     6. According  to the well settled, theory of precedents\nevery  decision\t  contains  three   basic  ingredients:\t (i)\nfindings of  material  facts,  direct  and  inferential.  An\ninferential finding,  of facts\tis the\tinference which\t the\nJudge draws  from the  direct, or  perceptible\tfacts,\t(ii)\nstatements of  the principles of law applicable to the legal\nproblems disclosed by the facts, (iii) Judgment based on the\ncombined effect\t of (i)\t and (ii).  For the  purposes of the\nparties themselves  and their  privies, ingredient No. (iii)\nis the\tmaterial element  in the  decision for it determines\nfinally their  rights and  liabilities in  relation  to\t the\nsubject-matter of the action. It is the judgment that estops\nthe parties  from reopening  the dispute.  However  for\t the\npurposes of  the doctrine of precedents, ingredient No. (ii)\nis the\tvital element  in the  decision. This  indeed is the\nratio decidendi.  It is\t not everything said by a judge when\ngiving judgment that constitutes a precedent. The only thing\nin a  judge&#x27;s decision binding a party is the principle upon\nwhich the  case\t is  decided  and  for\tthis  reason  it  is\nimportant to  analyse a\t decision and  isolate from  it\t the\nradio decidendi. [1073G-1074B]\n     7. The ratio decidendi may be defined as a statement of\nlaw applied  to the  legal problems  raised by\tthe facts as\nfound, upon  which the decision is based. The other elements\nin the decision are not precedents. [1074C]\n     Qualcast (Wolverhampton)  Ltd. v. Haynes L.R. 1959 A.C.\n743 referred to.\n     8. Even  where the\t direct facts  of  an  earlier\tcase\nappear to  be identical\t to those  of the  case\t before\t the\nCourt, the  Judge is not bound to draw the same inference as\ndrawn in the earlier case. [1074D]\n1063\n     9. There  are no rationes decidendi much less any ratio\ndecidendi in  Rajendra Prasad&#x27;s case. [1074-E]\n     (i) In  the minority  opinion  the\t need  for  judicial\nrestraint was  emphasised and the duty to avoid encroachment\non the\tpowers conferred  upon Parliament. The assessment of\npublic opinion\ton this\t difficult and\tcomplex question was\nessentially a legislatives not a judicial, function. [1074El\n     (ii) Buttressed  by the  belief that Capital punishment\nserved no useful purpose, the majority, asserted that it was\nmorally unacceptable  to the  contemporary society and found\nit shocking  to their  conscience and  sense of justice. The\ndeliberate extinguishment  of human life by the State for an\noffence of  murder, was\t a denial  of human  dignity and the\ndeath penalty  was usually inflicted only on a few, i.e. the\npoor and  downtrodden who  are outcasts\t of a society, which\nled to\tthe irresistible  inference that  the punishment was\nnot fairly applied. [1074F]\n     (iii) This\t may be &#x27;progressive&#x27; stance which is out of\nplace in  a judicial  pronouncement, which ought to be based\non the\tfacts and  circumstances of  the case  and  the\t law\napplicable. But the professed view does not stem from a firm\nbelief in  dignity of  human life  for the  death penalty is\nadvocated for  certain classes of offenders namely (l) white\ncollar\toffenders,   (2)  anti-social  Offenders  and  (3  )\nhardened murderers.  This shows\t that the  majority was\t not\nagainst the capital punishment in principle. [1074G-1075A]\n     (iv) on  the facts,  the majority commuted the sentence\nof death  to a\tsentence of  imprisonment for  life, and the\ndecision cannot,  therefore, be\t construed as  laying down a\nratio decidendi. [1075B\n     10. The  majority decision\t tested in  the light of the\ntheory of  precedents clearly  does not\t lay down  any legal\nprinciple applied  to any  legal problem  disclosed  by\t the\nfacts and,  therefore, the majority decision cannot be, said\nto have &#x27;declared any law&#x27; within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/882644/\" id=\"a_21\">Art. 141</a> so\nas to  bind all\t courts in the country. General observations\nmade in the context of sentencing jurisprudence will have to\nbe regarded  as the  view of the Judge/ Judges concerned-and\nnot &#x27;law  declared by  this court&#x27;  under <a href=\"/doc/882644/\" id=\"a_22\">Art.\t141</a>  of\t the\nConstitution. Any  attempt  to\tlimit  or  circumscribe\t the\nconnotation of\t&#x27;special reasons&#x27;  mentioned in<a href=\"/doc/324405/\" id=\"a_23\"> s. 354(3)</a> of\nthe   Code   of\t  Criminal   Procedure\t by   indulging\t  in\nclassification of  murders such as white collar offences and\nnonwhite collar offences or laying down so-called guidelines\nfor imposition\tof the\textreme\t penalty,  would  amount  to\nunwarranted abridgement\t of the discretion legally vested in\nthe  trial   court  and\t  constitutionally  upheld  by\tthis\nCourt.[1075C-D]\n     11.  If   the  general   observations   on\t  sentencing\njurisprudence made  in Rajendra\t Prasad&#x27;s  ease\t are  to  be\nregarded as  &#x27;law declared by this Court&#x27; within the meaning\nof <a href=\"/doc/882644/\" id=\"a_24\">Art.\t 141</a> so,  as to bind all courts in the country, then\nthe observation\t or the so-called guidelines to the effect &quot;\n&#x27;special reasons&#x27;  necessary for imposing death penalty must\nrelate, not  to the  crime as  such  but  to  the  criminal&quot;\noccurring in the majority judgment, it must be stated, would\nbe unwarranted\tand contrary  to s  302 of  the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_25\">Indian Penal\nCode</a> read  with<a href=\"/doc/324405/\" id=\"a_26\"> s. 354(3)</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure.\n[1075E-F]\n1064\n     12. <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_27\">S. 302</a> of the I.P.C. gives a choice while<a href=\"/doc/203036/\" id=\"a_28\"> s. 354(3)</a>\nof  the\t  Code\tmerely\trequires  &#x27;special  reasons&#x27;  to  be\nindicated for  imposing the death penalty. Nothing is stated\nwhether the  &#x27;special reasons&#x27; should relate to the criminal\nor the\tcrime. In  the absence of any specific indication in\nthat behalf &#x27;special reasons&#x27; would relate both to the crime\nand the\t criminal. Previously,\tperhaps, more  attention was\nbeing  paid  to\t the  nature,  gravity\tand  the  manner  of\ncommitting the\tcrime, though extenuating factors concerning\nthe criminal,  his age,\t criminal tendencies  etc. were\t not\nignored. [1075G]\n     13. In  the majority judgment in Rajendra Prasad&#x27;s case\nnothing new  has been  said except  that  more\temphasis  on\nfactors concerning  the criminal  is indicated.\t But in\t the\ngreat enthusiasm for doing so, the pendulum has swung to the\nother extreme  and the\tguideline given is that the &#x27;special\nreasons&#x27; must  relate &quot;not  to the  Crime as such but to the\ncriminal,&quot; for which there is no warrant in<a href=\"/doc/324405/\" id=\"a_29\"> s. 354(3)</a> of the\nCode of Criminal Procedure. [1075H-1076A]\n     14. The  obsession to  get the  death penalty abolished\nfrom the  Statute Book\ti.e. <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_30\">Indian  Penal Code</a>\t 1860 is  so\ngreat great  an interdict  against it  is surprisingly spelt\nout from  the Constitution  itself because right to life has\nbeen regarded as &#x27;very valuable, sacrosanct and fundamental&#x27;\ntherein, though\t in Jagmohan  Singh&#x27;s case  1(1973) 1 S.C.C.\n20] a constitution bench of this Court unanimously held that\nthe death  penalty and the judicial discretion vested in the\nCourt  regarding   its\timposition   on\t  an   accused\t are\nconstitutionally valid. [1076B-C]\n     15. So  long as  the extreme penalty is retained on the\nStatute Book,  it would\t be impermissible  for any  Judge to\nadvocate its abolition in judicial pronouncements. The forum\nfor that is elsewhere. [1076D]\n     (a) In  the instant  case it  cannot be  said that\t the\naward of  death sentence  to any  of the two appellants, was\nnot proper  or uncalled for. Though the dispute was over the\n&#x27;turns\tof   water,&#x27;   that   would   hardly   furnish\t any\njustification for  the commission  of the pre-planned triple\nmurder. The  dastardly act of the appellants resulted in the\nloss  of  three\t precious  lives.  These  were\tnothing\t but\nintentional, cold-blooded and brutal murders. [1077A, E]\n     (b) The  High Court  was justified\t in  confirming\t the\ndeath sentence\tpassed under  s. 368(a)\t of the\t Code, being\nsatisfied that\tthere  were  &#x27;special  reasons&quot;\t within\t the\nmeaning of  s. 354,  sub-s.

And alcohol\nmakes men  beside themselves  and buries sanity. The role of\nintoxicating drinks  and drugs\tin aggressive  behaviour and\nexplosive crime\t has not  been\tthe  subject  of  sufficient\ncriminological research\t in the country.

True,\nthe jurisprudence  of sentencing  in Free  India has  been a\nCinderella and\tthe values  of\tour  Constitution  have\t not\nadequately humanized  the punitive  diagnostics of  criminal\ncourts, which  sometimes, though  rarely, remined  us of the\ntorturesome and trigger-happy aberrations of the Middle Ages\nand some  gory geographic  segments, soaked  in\t retributive\nblood and  untouched  by  the  correctional  karuna  of\t our\nconstitutional culture.\t But after  Ediga Annama&#x27;s  case(l),\nthe law\t of punishment\tunder<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_34\"> s. 302</a> I.P.C. has been largely\nsettled by this Court and the High Courts are bound thereby.\nRajendra Prasad&#x27;s  case (supra)\t and  Bishnu  Deo  Shaw&#x27;s(2)\ncase, have indubitably laid down the normative cynosure\n     (1) [1974] 4 S.C.C.443\n     (2) [1979] 3 S.C.R. 355\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">1069</span>\nand until over-ruled by a larger bench of this court that is\nthe law\t of A  the land\t under <a href=\"/doc/882644/\" id=\"a_35\">Art. 141.</a> To discard it is to\ndisobey the Constitution and such subversiveness of the rule\nof law,\t in a  crucial area  of life  and death,  will spell\njudicial  disorder.   One  thing   is  clear.  Counting\t the\ncasualties is  not the\tmain  criterion\t for  sentencing  to\ndeath; nor recklessness in the act of murder. The sole focus\non the\tcrime and the total farewell to the criminal and his\nsocial-personal circumstances  mutilate sentencing  justice.\nWe express  ourselves in  this explicit\t fashion  since\t the\ndeep-rooted Raj\t criminological prejudices  still haunt Free\nIndia&#x27;s courts and govern our mentations from the grave. To-\nday, the  law  is  what\t Rajendra  Prasad  (supra),  in\t its\nmajority judgment,  has laid  down and that has been done at\nunmistakable length,  Willy-nilly,  that  binds\t judges\t and\nparties alike.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">     The problem in the present case, going by those canons,\nis easy\t of resolution.\t Death\tsentence  in  this  case  is\nindefensible. We  can surely understand how the courts below\nhave fallen  into this fatal error. The forensic exercise at\nthe sentencing\tstage,\tdespite\t the  purposeful  s.  235(2)\n<a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_36\">Cr.P.C</a>., has been a functional failure because of the casual\nway the\t punishment factors are dealt with, as if the nature\nof the\tcrime was the sole determinant of the punishment. We\nhave explained in Rajendra Prasad&#x27;s case how the prosecution\nmust make  out, by  special factors,  why me  graver penalty\nshould be  inflicted. Evidence\tmay  be\t led  and  arguments\naddressed by  both sides, but in practice b. 235(2) has been\nfrustratingly ritualised.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">     Nor do  we think  that the court&#x27;s attention been drawn\nto Ediga  Annamma&#x27;s case.  The two  recent decisions of this\nCourt could  not have  been within  the\t ken  of  the  Court\nbecause they  were delivered  later. Be\t that as it may, one\nhas only to read the ratio in these three cases side by side\nwith facts of the present case to hold that death Ir penalty\nis unmerited.  Here, the  earlier provocation  came from the\ndeceased&#x27;s side\t by beating up Appellant No. 3. The parties,\nincluding the  prosecution group, were tipsy. There had been\nantecedent irrigation  irrigation between them. There was no\nprepalanned, well  laid attack, hell-bent on liquidating the\nenemy. A  quarrel over\tturn af\t water; a  pacification\t pro\ntempore; an  afternoon exuberance  with jocose and bellicose\npotions, beating  up one  appellant leading to a reprisal vi\net armis.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">     In Rajendra  Prasad&#x27;s case\t (supra) the  court, in\t its\nmajority judgement, observed:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">\t  &quot;It is  not the  number of  deaths caused  nor the\n     situs of  the stabs that is telling on that decision to\n     validate the non-\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">1070</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">     application of its ratio.

But\n     it is  no social  solution to add one more life lost to\n     the list.\tIn this\t view, we  are\tsatisfied  that\t the\n     appellant has  not received reasonable consideration an\n     the question  of the appropriate sentence. The criteria\n     we have  laid down\t are clear  enough to  point to\t the\n     softening of  the sentence to one of life imprisonment.\n     A\tfamily\tfeud,  an  altercation,\t a  sudden  passion,\n     although attended\twith extra-ordinary  cruelty,  young\n     and malleable  age, reasonable  prospect of reformation\n     and absence  of any  conclusive circumstances  that the\n     assailant is  a habitual  murderer or  given to chronic\n     violence-these catena  of circumstances  bearing on the\n     offender call for the lesser sentence.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_16\">     The other\tcriteria have been set out at some length in\nthe same  judgment and,\t going by  them, there is hardly any\nwarrant for  judicial extinguishment  of two precious Indian\nlives. Section\t302 of\tthe Penal  Code, read  with  <a href=\"/doc/324405/\" id=\"a_37\">Section\n354(3)</a> of  the\tCriminal  Procedure  Code,  demands  special\nreasons for  awarding the graver sentence, and to borrow the\nreasoning in Rajendra Prasad&#x27;s case.\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">\t  &quot;Special reasons&#x27;  necessary\tfor  imposing  death\n     penalty must  relate, not\tto the\tcrime as such but to\n     the criminal.   The  crime may  be shocking and yet the\n     criminal may  not deserve\tdeath penalty. The crime may\n     be less shocking than other murders and yet the callous\n     criminal, e.g.  a\tlethal\teconomic  offender,  may  be\n     jeopardizing societal  existence by  his act of murder.\n     Likewise, a hardened murderer or dacoit or armed robber\n     who kills and relishes killing and raping and murdering\n     to such  an extent\t that he  is  beyond  rehabilitation\n     within  a\treasonable  period  according  to  cur\trent\n     psycho-therapy or\tcurative techniques  may deserve the\n     terminal sentence.\t Society survives  by  security\t for\n     ordinary life. If officers enjoined to defend the peace\n     are treacherously\tkilled to facilitate perpetuation of\n     murderous and  often plunderous  crimes social  justice\n     steps in to demand penalty dependent on the totality of\n     circumstances.&quot;\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">1071</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_17\">     We see  no need  to expand\t on the\t narrow survival  of\ndeath sentence\tin our\tCode confined  to those\t exceptional\nsituations  explained  in  Rajendra  Prasad&#x27;s  case.  It  is\nheartening, though  unheeded that  the framers\tof the\tCode\nthemselves state-d:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">\t  &quot;We are convinced that the Death penalty should be\n     very  sparingly  inflicted.  To  a\t great\tmajority  of\n     mankind nothing is so dear as life.&quot;(&#x27;)\n     Death sentence  on death  sentence is  the\t upsurge  of\nworld opinion  and Indian  cultural  expression.  In  Shanti\nParva of the Mahabharata, Prince Satyavana in the discussion\non the capital penalty says:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">\t  &quot;Destruction of  the individual  by the  king\t can\n     never be  a virtuous act. By killing the wrong-doer the\n     king kills\t a large  number of  innocent persons, wife,\n     father, mother and children are killed. A wicked person\n     is seen  to imbibe\t good conduct  from a  pious person.\n     Good  children   spring  from   wicked   persons.\t The\n     extermination of  the wicked  is hot in consonance with\n     eternal law.&quot;(2)\nwhile such unanimity in sublimity may not, by itself, repeal\nthe legislated\ttext, judicial dispensers do not behave like\ncavemen but breath the fresh air of finer culture.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">     The sentences of death in the present appeal are liable\nto be reduced to life imprisonment. We may add a footnote to\nthe ruling  in Rajendra\t Prasad&#x27;s case.\t Taking the cue from\nthe English  legislation on  abolition, we  may suggest that\nlife imprisonment  which strictly means imprisonment for the\nwhole  of  the\tman&#x27;s  life,  but  in  practice\t amounts  to\nincarceration for  a period  between 10 and 14 years may, at\nthe option  of the  convicting\tcourt,\tbe  subject  to\t the\ncondition that\tthe sentence  of imprisonment  shall last as\nlong as\t life lasts  where there are exceptional indications\nof murderous  recidivism and  the community  cannot run\t the\nrisk of\t the convict  being at\tlarge. This  takes  care  of\njudicial apprehensions that unless physically liquidated the\nculprit may at some remote time repeat murder. . G\n     Another sombre  fact of  history, not often stressed in\ncourt sentences\t save by  judges like  Douglas\tand  Thurgod\nMarshall, is  that the\tgallows swallow,  in most cases, the\nsocial dissenter, the political\n     (1)  Indian Penal Cod-Objects and reasons.\n     (2)  Chapter 13,  ShantiParva, Mahabharata,  translated\n\t  by Shri  K.

The matter is essentially of\npolitical expediency  and, as such, it is the concern of the\nstatesman and, therefore, the domain of the Legislature, and\nnot the Judiciary.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_23\">     <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 302</a>  I.P.C., 1860,\t confers upon  the  Court  a\ndiscretion in the matter of the punishment to be imposed for\nan offence  of murder  and the Court has to choose between a\nsentence of  death and\ta sentence of imprisonment for life;\nwhile under  s. 354(3)\t<a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_40\">Cr.P.C</a>., 1973, the Court is enjoined\nwith a\tduty to record &#x27;special reasons&#x27; in case the extreme\npenalty is  awarded. But  the  question\t whether  the  death\nsentence should\t be awarded or not must, in my view, be left\nto the\tdiscretion of  the Judge  trying the accused and the\nquestion  of   sentence\t must  depend  upon  the  facts\t and\ncircumstances obtaining\t in such  case. When  a sentence  of\ndeath is  passed it  is subject\t to confirmation by the High\nCourt under  s. 366(1)\tof the Code and the accused also has\nright of  appeal to  the High  Court under 5. 374(2) against\nthe sentence.  Thereafter an  appeal lies  to this  Court by\nspecial leave under <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_41\">Art. 136</a> on the question of sentence. It\nwould therefore,  be manifest that it is neither feasible to\ndefine nor  legally permissible\t for this  Court to limit or\ncircumscribe the  connotation  of  the\texpression  &#x27;special\nreasons&#x27; occurring  in s.  354(3) of the Code so as to bring\nabout a virtual abolition of the death sentence. E\n     With  greatest   respect,\tthe   majority\tdecision  in\nRajendra Prasad&#x27;s  case (supra)\t does not lay down any legal\nprinciple of general applicability. A decision on a question\nof sentence  depending upon the facts and circumstances of a\nparticular  case,   can\t never\tbe  regarded  as  a  binding\nprecedent, much\t less &#x27;law  declared&#x27; within  the meaning of\n<a href=\"/doc/882644/\" id=\"a_42\">Art. 141</a> of the Constitution so as to bind all Courts within\nthe territory of India. According to the well-settled theory\nof  precedents\t every\t decision   contains   three   basic\ningredients:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">\t  (i)  findings\t of   material\tfacts,\t direct\t and\n\t       inferential. An\tinferential finding of facts\n\t       is the  inference which\tthe Judge draws from\n\t       the direct, or perceptible facts,\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">\t  (ii) statements   of\t the   principles   of\t law\n\t       applicable to the legal problems disclosed by\n\t       the facts; and\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">\t  (iii)judgment based  on the combined effect of (i)\n\t       and (ii) above. H\nfor  the  purposes  of\tthe  parties  themselves  and  their\nprivies, ingredient No. (iii) is the material element in the\ndecision for it determines\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">1074</span>\nfinally their  rights and  liabilities in  relation  to\t the\nsubject matter of the action. It is the judgment that estops\nthe parties  from reopening  the dispute.  However, for\t the\npurposes of  The doctrine  of precedents ingredient No. (ii)\nis the\tvital element  in the  decision. This  indeed is the\nratio decidendi(l).  It is  not every  thing said by a Judge\nwhen giving  judgment that constitutes a precedent. The only\nthing in  a Judge  decision binding  party is  the principle\nupon which  the case  is decided  and for  this reason it is\nimportant to  analyse a\t decision and  isolate from  it\t the\nratio  decidendi.   In\tthe   leading\tcase   of   Qualcast\n(Wolverhampton) Ltd.  v. Haynes(2) it was laid down that the\nratio decidendi may be defined if a statement of law applied\nto the\tlegal problems\traised by  the facts  is found, upon\nwhich the  decision is\tbased. The other two elements in the\ndecision are  not precedents.  The judgement  if not binding\n(except directly  on the  parties themselves),\tnor are\t the\nfindings of  facts. This  means that  even where  the direct\nfacts of  an earlier case appear to be identical to those of\nthe case  before the  Court, the  Judge is not bound to draw\nthe same inference as drawn in the earlier case\n     One  would\t find  that  in\t the  decision\tin  Rajendra\nPrasad&#x27;s case,\tthere are  no rationes\tdecidendi, much less\nany ratio decidendi. In a minority opinion, I emphasised the\nneed  for   judicial  restraint\t  and  the   duty  to  avoid\nencroachment on\t the powers conferred upon Parliament. In my\nview, the  assessment of  public opinion  on this  difficult\nan(l complex  question was  essentially a legislative, not a\njudicial, function.  The majority  expressed their  personal\ndistaste for  the capital  punishment,\tbutteressed  by\t the\nbelief that  it served no useful purpose. They asserted that\nthe capital  punishment\t was  morally  unacceptable  to\t the\ncontemporary  society\tand  found   it\t shocking  to  their\nconscience   and    sense   of\t justice.   The\t  deliberate\nextinguishment of  human life by the State for an offence of\nmurder,\t they\treasoned   on\tmetaphysical   theories\t  of\npunishment, was a denial of human dignity. They concluded by\nstating that the death penalty was usually inflicted only on\na few,\ti.e., the poor and down-trodden who are outcastes of\na society  which led  to the irresistible inference that the\npunishment  was\t  not  fairly\tapplied.  This\t may  be   a\n&#x27;progressive&#x27; stance,  which is\t out of\t place in a judicial\npronouncement, which  ought to\tbe based  on the  facts\t and\ncircumstance of\t the case  and the  law applicable.  But the\nprofessed view\tdoes not  stem from a firm belief in dignity\nof human life for they themselves advocate the death penalty\nfor certain classes of offenders,\n (I)  R. J. Walker &amp; M. G.

On  the  facts  before  them\t they  commuted\t the\nsentence of  death to  a sentence  of imprisonment for life,\nand the\t decision cannot,  therefore, be construed as laying\ndown a ratio decidendi.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">     Testing the majority decision in Rajendra Prasad&#x27;s case\n(supra) in  light of theory of precedents as expounded above\nit seems  to me\t clear that  it does not lay down many legal\nprinciple applied  to any  legal problem  disclosed  by\t the\nfacts and, therefore the majority decision cannot be said to\nhave &#x27;declared any law&#x27; within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/882644/\" id=\"a_43\">Art. 141</a> so as\nto bind all Courts in the country.

Nothing is  stated whether the\n&#x27;special reasons&#x27;  should relate  to  the  criminal  or\t the\ncrime. In  the absence\tof any\tspecific indication  in that\nbehalf &#x27;special\t reasons&#x27; would relate both to the crime and\nthe Criminal.  Previously, perhaps  more attention was being\npaid to the nature, gravity and the manner of committing the\ncrime, though  extenuating factors  concerning the criminal,\nhis age,  criminal tendencies  etc. were not ignored. In the\nmajority judgment in Rajendra Prasad&#x27;s case (supra), nothing\nnew has\t been said  except that\t more  emphasis\t on  factors\nconcerning the\tcriminal is  indicated.\t But  in  the  great\nenthusiasm for doing so, the pendulum has swung to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">1076</span>\nthe other  extreme and\tthe  guideline\tgiven  is  that\t the\n&#x27;special reasons&#x27;  must relate &quot;not to the crime as such but\nto the\tcriminal&quot; for which there is no warrant in<a href=\"/doc/324405/\" id=\"a_50\"> s. 354(3)</a>\nof the Code of Criminal Procedure.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">     I may  also venture  to say,  the obsession  to get the\ndeath penalty  abolished from the Statute Book, i.e., <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_51\">Indian\nPenal Code</a>,  1860, is  so great that an interdict against it\nis surprisingly\t spelt\tout  from  the\tConstitution  itself\nbecause right  to life\thas been regarded as &#x27;very valuable,\nsacrosanct and\tfundamental&#x27;  therein,\tthough\tin  Jagmohan\nSingh&#x27;s case(1)\t this Court  by unanimous  judgment of\tfive\nJudges\theld   that  the  death\t penalty  and  the  judicial\ndiscretion vested  in the  Court regarding its imposition on\nan accused are constitutionally valid. That decision, it may\nincidentally be\t pointed out,  has adverted  to\t the  &quot;well-\nsettled principles&quot;  which have all these years governed the\nexercise  of   proper  judicial\t  discretion.  In  my  view,\ntherefore, so long as the extreme penalty is retained on the\nStatute Book,  it would\t be impermissible  for any  Judge to\nadvocate its abolition in judicial pronouncements. The forum\nfor that is elsewhere.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_29\">     There is  increasing concern  today about the judiciary\ntransgressing its  limits by  usurping the  function of\t the\nlegislature. Many  critics  think  that\t the  courts  should\n&#x27;apply&#x27;, but  not &#x27;make&#x27;,  the law  and that they should not\nintrude into the field of policy-making. The problem appears\nto the\talso acute  in the  United States  of America.\tIn a\nrecent\tarticle,  a  learned  writer(2)\t views\tthe  complex\nsituation with deep concern, stating:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">\t  &quot;Today many  Americans  do  resent  all  ever-more\n     activist judiciary.

Though  the dispute was over the &#x27;turns of water&#x27;, that\nwould hardly  furnish any jutification for the commission of\nthe pre-planned\t triple murder.\t The appellant\tDalbir Singh\nfired two gun shots hitting the deceased Sardul Singh on the\nchest,\tresulting  in  his  instantaneous  death.  When\t the\ndeceased Jagir\tSingh stooped  forward to lift Sardul Singh,\nhe was\tfired at by the appellant Kulwant Singh with his gun\nwhich hit  him on  the forehead.  This also  resulted in his\nimmediate death.  When the deceased Piara Singh came forward\nto rescue  Jagir Singh, both the appellant Kulwant Singh and\nDalbir Singh  again fired  at him  from\t their\tguns,  as  a\nresult of  which he  fell down and succumbed to his injuries\non the\tspot.  Thereafter,  both  the  appellants  continued\nfiring their  guns at  the complainant&#x27;s  party\t and  Kapoor\nSingh PW  14 and  no other  alternative but to bring out his\nlicensed gun  from his\thouse. Thereupon, both sides started\nfiring and  a number  of persons sustained gun shot injuries\non their person. Baga Singh, lambardar of the village in the\nmidst of  this firing  appeared on  the scene  and  made  an\nattempt to  pecify both\t the sides, but he also received gun\nshot injuries  as a  result of which he died two days later.\nThe dastardly  act of the appellants resulted in the loss of\nthree precious lives. That leaves out of account the fourth,\nBaga Singh,  who made  a dying\tdeclaration that he had also\nbeen shot by the appellants, but the High Court felt that he\nmight  have   been  caught   between  the  cross-fire  which\nsubsequently ensued  after the\tthree had fallen. These were\nnothing but intentional, coldblooded and brutal murders.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_35\">     In my  view, the High Court was justified in confirming\nthe death  sentences passed  under s.  368(a) of  the  Code,\nbeing satisfied that there were &quot;special reasons&quot; within the\nmeaning of  s. 354,  sub-s. (3)\t of  the  Code\tof  Criminal\nprocedure,  1973,   I  would  say  that\t on  the  facts\t and\ncircumstances of  the case,  the award\tof death sentence to\nthe two\t appellants was neither &#x27;erroneous in principle&#x27; nor\nwas &#x27;arbitrary\tor excessive&#x27;, or &#x27;indicative of an improper\nexercise of discretion&#x27;. nor my part, I have no sympathy for\nthese trigger-happy  gentlemen and  the sentence  imposed on\nthem is well-merited.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_36\">     I would,  therefore, dismiss  the\tappeal\tleaving\t the\nappellants to Executive clemency.\n</p><pre id=\"pre_2\">N.V.K\t\t\t\t\t     Appeal allowed.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">1078</span>\n\n\n\n</pre>",
