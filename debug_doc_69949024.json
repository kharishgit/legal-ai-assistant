In B.S. Joshi1 , the undisputed facts were these :  the  husband\nwas one of the appellants while the wife was respondent no. 2 in the  appeal\nbefore  this  Court.  They  were  married  on  21.7.1999  and  were   living\nseparately  since  15.7.2000.  An  FIR   was   registered   under   <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_31\">Sections\n498-A</a>/<a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_32\">323</a> and <a href=\"/doc/988620/\" id=\"a_33\">406</a>, IPC at the instance of the wife  on  2.1.2002.  When  the\ncriminal case registered at the  instance  of  the  wife  was  pending,  the\ndispute between the husband and wife and their family members was   settled.\nIt appears that the wife filed an  affidavit  that  her  disputes  with  the\nhusband and the other members of his family had  been  finally  settled  and\nshe and her husband had  agreed  for  mutual  divorce.  Based  on  the  said\naffidavit, the matter was taken to the High Court by both  the  parties  and\nthey jointly prayed for quashing the criminal proceedings  launched  against\nthe husband and his family members on the basis of  the  FIR  registered  at\nthe wife’s instance under  <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_34\">Sections  498-A</a>  and  <a href=\"/doc/988620/\" id=\"a_35\">406</a>  IPC.  The  High  Court\ndismissed the petition for quashing the FIR as  in  its  view  the  offences\nunder <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_36\">Sections 498-A</a> and <a href=\"/doc/988620/\" id=\"a_37\">406</a>, IPC were  non-compoundable  and  the  inherent\npowers under <a href=\"/doc/903398/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 482</a> of  the  Code  could  not  be  invoked  to  by-pass\n<a href=\"/doc/895891/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 320</a> of the Code. It is from this order that the matter reached  this\nCourt. This Court held that the High  Court  in  exercise  of  its  inherent\npowers could quash criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint and <a href=\"/doc/895891/\" id=\"a_40\">Section  320</a>\nof the Code did not limit or affect the powers  under  <a href=\"/doc/903398/\" id=\"a_41\">Section  482</a>  of  the\nCode.

The  bank\nalso filed a complaint against the company, its Managing  Director  and  the\nofficials of Andhra Bank for diverse offences, namely,  <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_48\">Section  120-B</a>  read\nwith <a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_49\">Sections 420</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1985627/\" id=\"a_50\">467</a>, <a href=\"/doc/556166/\" id=\"a_51\">468</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1466184/\" id=\"a_52\">471</a> of the IPC  read  with  <a href=\"/doc/171288855/\" id=\"a_53\">Sections  5(2)</a>  and\n<a href=\"/doc/182822854/\" id=\"a_54\">5(1)(d)</a> of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947  and  Section  13(2)  read\nwith <a href=\"/doc/178303/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 13(1)(d)</a> of the Prevention of Corruption Act,  1988.  The  suit\nfor recovery filed  by  the  bank  against  the  company  and  the  Managing\nDirector of the Company was compromised. The suit was compromised  upon  the\ndefendants agreeing to pay the amounts due as per the schedule mentioned  in\nthe consent terms. Clause 11 of the consent terms read,  “agreed  that  save\nas aforesaid neither party has any claim against the other  and  parties  do\nhereby withdraw all the allegations  and  counter-allegations  made  against\neach other”. Based on clause 11 of the consent terms, the Managing  Director\nof the Company, the appellant who was accused no. 3 in  charge  sheet  filed\nby CBI, made application for discharge  from  the  criminal  complaint.  The\nsaid application was rejected by the Special Judge  (CBI),  Greater  Bombay,\nwhich came to be challenged before the Bombay  High  Court.  The  contention\nbefore the High Court was that since the subject matter of the  dispute  had\nbeen settled between the appellant and the bank, it  would  be  unreasonable\nto continue with the criminal  proceedings.  The  High  Court  rejected  the\napplication for discharge from the criminal cases. It  is  from  this  order\nthat the matter reached this Court  by  way  of  special  leave.  The  Court\nhaving regard to the facts of the case and  the  earlier  decision  of  this\nCourt in B.S. Joshi1, set aside the order of the High Court and quashed  the\ncriminal proceedings by consideration of the matter thus:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">           “28. The basic intention of the accused in this case appears  to\n           have been to misrepresent the financial status of  the  Company,\n           M/s Neemuch Emballage Ltd., Mumbai, in order  to  avail  of  the\n           credit facilities to an extent to  which  the  Company  was  not\n           entitled. In other words, the main intention of the Company  and\n           its officers was to cheat the Bank and induce it  to  part  with\n           additional amounts of  credit  to  which  the  Company  was  not\n           otherwise entitled.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">           <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"469138\" id=\"span_8\">29.

In Manoj Sharma3, the Court  was  concerned  with  the  question\nwhether an F.I.R. under <a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_60\">Sections 420</a>/<a href=\"/doc/556166/\" id=\"a_61\">468</a>/<a href=\"/doc/1466184/\" id=\"a_62\">471</a>/<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_63\">34</a>/<a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_64\">120-B</a>  IPC  can  be  quashed\neither  under  Section  482  of  the  Code  or  under  <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_65\">Article  226</a>  of  the\nConstitution when the accused  and  the  complainant  have  compromised  and\nsettled the matter between themselves. Altamas Kabir, J., who delivered  the\nlead judgment referred to B.S. Joshi1  and the submission made on behalf  of\nthe State that B.S. Joshi1 required a second look and held  that  the  Court\nwas not inclined to accept the contention made on behalf of the  State  that\nthe decision in B.S. Joshi1  required reconsideration, at least not  in  the\nfacts of the case. It was held that what was decided  in  B.S.  Joshi1   was\nthe power and authority of the High Court  to  exercise  jurisdiction  under\nSection 482 of the Code or under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_66\">Article 226</a> of the  Constitution  to  quash\noffences which were not compoundable. The law stated in B.S. Joshi1   simply\nindicated the powers of the High Court to quash any criminal  proceeding  or\nfirst  information  report  or   complaint   whether   the   offences   were\ncompoundable or not. Altamas  Kabir,  J.  further  observed,  “The  ultimate\nexercise of discretion under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_67\">Section 482</a> CrPC or under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_68\">Article  226</a>  of  the\nConstitution is with the court which has to exercise  such  jurisdiction  in\nthe facts of each case. It has been explained that the said power is  in  no\nway limited by the  provisions  of  <a href=\"/doc/91933/\" id=\"a_69\">Section  320</a>  CrPC.  We  are  unable  to\ndisagree with such statement of law. In any event,  in  this  case,  we  are\nonly  required  to  consider  whether  the  High  Court  had  exercised  its\njurisdiction under  <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_70\">Section  482</a>  CrPC  legally  and  correctly.”   Then  in\nparagraphs 8 and 9      (pg. 5) of the  Report,  Altamas  Kabir,  J.,  inter\nalia, held as under :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">           “8. …..Once the complainant decided not  to  pursue  the  matter\n           further, the High Court could have taken a more  pragmatic  view\n           of the matter.

Markandey Katju, J. although concurred with the view of  Altamas\nKabir, J. that criminal proceedings <a href=\"/doc/469138/\" id=\"a_72\">in that case</a> deserved to be quashed  but\nobserved that question may have to be decided in  some  subsequent  decision\nor decisions (preferably by a larger Bench)  as  to  which  non-compoundable\ncases can be quashed under Section 482 of the Code or  <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_73\">Article  226</a>  of  the\nConstitution on the basis that the parties have entered into compromise.  In\nparagraphs 27 and 28 (pg. 10) of the report he held as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">           “27. There can be no doubt that a case under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_74\">Section 302</a> IPC  or\n           other serious offences like those under Sections 395, 307 or 304-\n           B cannot be compounded and hence proceedings in those provisions\n           cannot be quashed by the High Court in  exercise  of  its  power\n           under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_75\">Section 482</a> CrPC or in writ jurisdiction on the  basis  of\n           compromise. However, in some other cases (like those akin  to  a\n           civil nature), the proceedings can be quashed by the High  Court\n           if the parties have come to an amicable settlement  even  though\n           the provisions are not compoundable. Where a line is to be drawn\n           will have to be decided in some later decisions of  this  Court,\n           preferably  by  a  larger  Bench  (so  as  to   make   it   more\n           authoritative). Some guidelines will have to be evolved in  this\n           connection and the matter cannot be left at  the  sole  unguided\n           discretion  of  Judges,  otherwise  there  may  be   conflicting\n           decisions and judicial anarchy. A judicial discretion has to  be\n           exercised on some objective guiding principles and criteria, and\n           not on the whims and fancies of individual  Judges.  Discretion,\n           after all, cannot be the Chancellor&#x27;s foot.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">           <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"469138\" id=\"span_10\">28.

Dr. Abhishek  Manu  Singhvi,  learned  senior  counsel  for  the\npetitioner in SLP(Crl.) No. 6324 of 2009 submitted that the  inherent  power\nof the High Court to quash a non-compoundable offence was not  circumscribed\nby any of the provisions of the Code, including Section 320. Section 482  is\na declaration of the inherent power pre-existing in the High  Court  and  so\nlong as the exercise of the inherent power falls within  the  parameters  of\nSection 482, it shall have an overriding effect over any of  the  provisions\nof the Code. He, thus, submitted that in exercise  of  its  inherent  powers\nunder Section  482,  the  High  Court  may  permit  compounding  of  a  non-\ncompoundable offence provided that in doing so it satisfies  the  conditions\nmentioned therein. Learned senior counsel would submit  that  the  power  to\nquash the criminal proceedings under Section 482 of the Code exists even  in\nnon-compoundable offence but its actual exercise will depend on facts  of  a\nparticular case. He submitted that some or all of the  following  tests  may\nbe relevant to decide  whether  to  quash  or  not  to  quash  the  criminal\nproceedings in a given case; (a) the nature and gravity of  case;  (b)  does\nthe dispute reflect  overwhelming  and  pre-dominantly  civil  flavour;  (c)\nwould the quashing  involve  settlement  of  entire  or  almost  the  entire\ndispute; (d) the compromise/settlement between parties  and/or  other  facts\nand the circumstances render possibility  of conviction  remote  and  bleak;\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\">(e) not to quash would cause extreme injustice and would not serve  ends  of\njustice and (f) not to quash would result in  abuse  of  process  of  court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_12\">10.         Shri P.P. Rao, learned senior  counsel  for  the  petitioner  in\nSpecial Leave Petition (Crl.) No. 5921 of 2009 submitted  that  Section  482\nof the Code is complete answer to the reference made to  the  larger  Bench.\nHe analysed Section 482 and Section 320  of  the  Code  and  submitted  that\nSection 320 did not limit or affect the inherent powers of the  High  Court.\nNotwithstanding Section 320, High Court can  exercise  its  inherent  power,\ninter alia, to prevent abuse of the process of any  court  or  otherwise  to\nsecure the ends of justice.  To secure the ends of justice  is  a  wholesome\nand definite guideline. It requires formation of opinion by  High  Court  on\nthe basis of material on record as to whether  the  ends  of  justice  would\njustify quashing of a particular criminal complaint, FIR  or  a  proceeding.\nWhen the Court exercises its inherent power under Section 482 in respect  of\noffences which are not compoundable taking into account the  fact  that  the\naccused and the complainant have  settled  their  differences  amicably,  it\ncannot  be  viewed  as  permitting  compounding  of  offence  which  is  not\ncompoundable.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">11.         Mr. P.P. Rao, learned senior counsel submitted that in cases  of\ncivil wrongs which also constitute criminal offences,  the  High  Court  may\npass order under Section 482 once both parties  jointly  pray  for  dropping\nthe criminal proceeding initiated by one of  them  to  put  an  end  to  the\ndispute and restore peace between the parties.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_14\">12.          Mr.  V.  Giri,  learned  senior  counsel  for  the   respondent\n(accused) in Special Leave Petition (Crl.) No. 6138 of 2006  submitted  that\nthe real question  that  needs  to  be  considered  by  this  Court  in  the\nreference is whether Section 320(9) of the Code creates a bar or  limits  or\naffects the inherent powers of the High  Court  under  Section  482  of  the\nCode. It was submitted that Section 320(9) does not create a  bar  or  limit\nor affect the inherent powers of the High Court in the  matter  of  quashing\nany criminal proceedings. Relying upon various decisions of this  Court,  it\nwas submitted that it has been consistently held that  the  High  Court  has\nunfettered powers under Section 482 of  the  Code  to  secure  the  ends  of\njustice and prevent abuse of the process of the  Court.  He  also  submitted\nthat on compromise between the  parties,  the  High  Court  in  exercise  of\npowers under Section 482 can quash the criminal  proceedings,  more  so  the\nmatters arising from matrimonial dispute, property dispute, dispute  between\nclose relations, partners or business concerns which  are  predominantly  of\ncivil, financial or commercial nature.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_15\">13.         Learned counsel for the petitioner  in  Special  Leave  Petition\n(Crl.) No. 8989 of 2010 submitted that the court should have  positive  view\nto quash the proceedings  once  the  aggrieved  party  has  compromised  the\nmatter with the wrong doer. It was submitted  that  if  the  court  did  not\nallow the quashing of FIR or complaint or criminal case  where  the  parties\nsettled their dispute amicably, it would encourage the parties to speak  lie\nin the court and witnesses would become hostile and the criminal  proceeding\nwould not end in conviction. Learned counsel submitted that the court  could\nalso consider the two questions (1) can there be  partial  quashing  of  the\nFIR qua accused  with  whom  the  complainant/aggrieved  party  enters  into\ncompromise. (2) can the court quash the proceedings in the cases which  have\nnot arisen from the matrimonial or  civil  disputes  but  the  offences  are\npersonal in nature like grievous hurt (S.326), attempt  to  murder  (S.307),\nrape (S.376), trespassing (S.452) and kidnapping (S.364, 365) etc.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_16\">14.          Mr.  P.  P.  Malhotra,  learned  Additional  Solicitor  General\nreferred to the scheme of the Code.

Similar  situation  may  follow  in  a  complaint  case.\nLearned Additional Solicitor General submitted that power under Section  482\nof the Code  cannot  be  invoked  in  the  non-compoundable  offences  since\nSection  320(9)  expressly  prohibits  the  compounding  of  such  offences.\nQuashing of criminal proceedings of the offences which are  non-compoundable\nwould negative the  effect  of  the  order  of  framing  charges  or  taking\ncognizance and therefore quashing would amount to taking away the  order  of\ncognizance passed by the Magistrate.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">15.         Learned Additional Solicitor General would submit that when  the\nCourt takes cognizance or frames charges,  it  is  in  accordance  with  the\nprocedure established by law.  Once the court  takes  cognizance  or  frames\ncharges, the method to  challenge  such  order  is  by  way  of  appropriate\napplication to the superior court under the provisions of the Code.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"861510\" id=\"span_11\">16.          If  power under Section 482 is exercised, in relation  to  non-\ncompoundable offences, it will amount to what is prohibited by law and  such\ncases cannot be brought within the parameters ‘to secure ends  of  justice’.\nAny  order  in  violation  and  breach  of  statutory  provisions,   learned\nAdditional Solicitor General would submit, would be a case against the  ends\nof justice.

In the exercise of  this  wholesome  power,  the  High\n           Court is entitled to quash a  proceeding  if  it  comes  to  the\n           conclusion that allowing the proceeding to continue would be  an\n           abuse of the process of the Court or that the  ends  of  justice\n           require that the proceeding ought to be quashed. The  saving  of\n           the High Court&#x27;s inherent powers, both  in  civil  and  criminal\n           matters, is designed to achieve a salutary public purpose  which\n           is that  a  court  proceeding  ought  not  to  be  permitted  to\n           degenerate into a weapon of  harassment  or  persecution.  In  a\n           criminal case, the veiled object behind a lame prosecution,  the\n           very nature of the  material  on  which  the  structure  of  the\n           prosecution rests and the like would justify the High  Court  in\n           quashing the proceeding in the interest of justice. The ends  of\n           justice are higher than the ends of mere law though justice  has\n           got  to  be  administered  according  to  laws   made   by   the\n           legislature.  The  compelling   necessity   for   making   these\n           observations is that without a proper realisation of the  object\n           and purpose of the provision which seeks to  save  the  inherent\n           powers of the High Court to do justice between the State and its\n           subjects, it would be impossible to  appreciate  the  width  and\n           contours of that salient jurisdiction.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">23.         The Court then observed that the considerations  justifying  the\nexercise of inherent powers for securing the ends of justice naturally  vary\nfrom case to case and a jurisdiction as wholesome as the  one  conferred  by\nSection 482 ought not to be encased  within  the  straitjacket  of  a  rigid\nformula.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"646292\" id=\"span_16\">24.

State  and  others</a>[13],  the  Court\nexplained the width and amplitude of the inherent power of  the  High  Court\nunder Section 482 vis-à-vis revisional power under Section 397 as follows:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">           “10.  …….The  opening  words  of  Section  482  contradict  this\n           contention because nothing of the Code, not  even  Section  397,\n           can affect the amplitude of the inherent power preserved  in  so\n           many terms by the language of Section 482. Even  so,  a  general\n           principle pervades this branch of law when a specific  provision\n           is made: easy resort to inherent power is not right except under\n           compelling  circumstances.  Not  that  there   is   absence   of\n           jurisdiction but that inherent power should not invade areas set\n           apart for specific power under the same Code. In Madhu  Limaye’s\n           case this Court has exhaustively and, if I may say so with great\n           respect, correctly  discussed  and  delineated  the  law  beyond\n           mistake. While it is true  that  Section  482  is  pervasive  it\n           should not subvert legal interdicts written into the same  Code,\n           such, for instance, in Section  397(2).  Apparent  conflict  may\n           arise in some situations between the two provisions and a  happy\n           solution\n\n\n\n\n              “would be to say that the bar provided in sub-section (2)  of\n              Section 397 operates only in exercise of the revisional power\n              of the High Court, meaning thereby that the High  Court  will\n              have no power of revision in relation  to  any  interlocutory\n              order. Then in accordance with one or  the  other  principles\n              enunciated above, the inherent power  will  come  into  play,\n              there being no other provision in the Code for the redress of\n              the grievance of the aggrieved party. But then, if the  order\n              assailed is purely of an interlocutory character which  could\n              be corrected in exercise of the revisional power of the  High\n              Court under the 1898 Code, the  High  Court  will  refuse  to\n              exercise its inherent power. But in case the  impugned  order\n              clearly brings about a situation which is  an  abuse  of  the\n              process of the Court or for the purpose of securing the  ends\n              of justice interference  by  the  High  Court  is  absolutely\n              necessary, then nothing contained in Section 397(2) can limit\n              or affect the exercise of the  inherent  power  by  the  High\n              Court. But such cases would be few and far between. The  High\n              Court must exercise the inherent power  very  sparingly.  One\n              such case would be the desirability  of  the  quashing  of  a\n              criminal proceeding initiated illegally,  vexatiously  or  as\n              being without jurisdiction”.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">           In short, there is no total ban  on  the  exercise  of  inherent\n           power  where  abuse  of  the  process  of  the  court  or  other\n           extraordinary situation excites the  court&#x27;s  jurisdiction.  The\n           limitation is self-restraint, nothing more. The  policy  of  the\n           law is clear that interlocutory orders, pure and simple,  should\n           not be taken up to  the  High  Court  resulting  in  unnecessary\n           litigation and delay. At the other  extreme,  final  orders  are\n           clearly capable of being  considered  in  exercise  of  inherent\n           power, if glaring injustice stares the court  in  the  face.  In\n           between is a tertium quid, as Untwalia, J. has  pointed  out  as\n           for example, where it is more than a purely interlocutory  order\n           and less than a final disposal. The  present  case  falls  under\n           that category where the accused complain of  harassment  through\n           the court&#x27;s process. Can we state that in  this  third  category\n           the inherent power can be exercised? In the words  of  Untwalia,\n           J.: (SCC p. 556, para 10)\n\n\n\n\n              “The answer is obvious that  the  bar  will  not  operate  to\n              prevent the abuse of the  process  of  the  Court  and/or  to\n              secure the ends of justice. The label of the  petition  filed\n              by an aggrieved party  is  immaterial.  The  High  Court  can\n              examine the matter in an appropriate case under its  inherent\n              powers. The present case undoubtedly falls  for  exercise  of\n              the power of the High Court in accordance with Section 482 of\n              the 1973 Code, even assuming, although  not  accepting,  that\n              invoking  the  revisional  power  of  the   High   Court   is\n              impermissible.”\n\n\n           I am, therefore clear in my mind that the inherent power is  not\n           rebuffed in the case situation before us. Counsel on both sides,\n           sensitively responding to our allergy for  legalistics,  rightly\n           agreed that the fanatical insistence on the formal filing  of  a\n           copy of the order under cessation need not take up this  court&#x27;s\n           time. Our conclusion concurs with the concession of  counsel  on\n           both sides that merely because a copy of the order has not  been\n           produced, despite its presence in the records in the  court,  it\n           is not possible for me to hold that the  entire  revisory  power\n           stands frustrated and the inherent power stultified.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">26.         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1484899\" id=\"span_18\">In <a href=\"/doc/1484899/\" id=\"a_88\">Simrikhia  v.  Dolley  Mukherjee  and  Chhabi  Mukherjee  and\nanother</a>[14], the Court considered the scope of Section 482 of the Code in  a\ncase where on dismissal of petition under Section  482,  a  second  petition\nunder Section 482 of the Code was made. The  contention  before  this  Court\nwas that the  second  petition  under  Section  482  of  the  Code  was  not\nentertainable; the exercise of power under Section 482 on a second  petition\nby the same party on the same ground virtually amounts  to   review  of  the\nearlier order and is contrary to the spirit of Section 362 of the  Code  and\nthe High Court was in error in having quashed the  proceedings  by  adopting\nthat course. While accepting this argument, this Court held as follows :</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">           “3.    ……The inherent power under Section  482  is  intended  to\n           prevent the abuse of the process of the court and to secure ends\n           of justice. Such power cannot be exercised to do something which\n           is expressly barred under the Code. If any consideration of  the\n           facts by way of review is not permissible under the Code and  is\n           expressly barred, it is  not  for  the  court  to  exercise  its\n           inherent power to reconsider the matter and record a conflicting\n           decision. If there had been change in the circumstances  of  the\n           case, it would be in order for the High Court  to  exercise  its\n           inherent  powers  in  the  prevailing  circumstances  and   pass\n           appropriate orders to secure the ends of justice or  to  prevent\n           the abuse of the process of the court. Where there  is  no  such\n           changed circumstances and the decision has to be arrived  at  on\n           the facts that existed as on the date of the earlier order,  the\n           exercise of the power to reconsider the same materials to arrive\n           at  different  conclusion  is  in  effect  a  review,  which  is\n           expressly barred under Section 362.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">           5. Section 362 of the Code expressly provides that no court when\n           it has signed its judgment or final order disposing of  a  case,\n           shall alter or review the same except to correct a  clerical  or\n           arithmetical error save  as  otherwise  provided  by  the  Code.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_29\">           Section 482 enables the High Court to make such order as may  be\n           necessary to give effect to any  order  under  the  Code  or  to\n           prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure\n           the ends of justice. The inherent powers, however, as  much  are\n           controlled by principle and precedent as are its express  powers\n           by statute. If a matter is covered by an express letter of  law,\n           the court cannot give a go-by to the  statutory  provisions  and\n           instead  evolve  a  new  provision  in  the  garb  of   inherent\n           jurisdiction.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\">           <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"484465\" id=\"span_19\">7.

The Court went on to explain the  exercise  of\ninherent power by the High Court  in paragraph 6 (Pg.94) of  the  Report  as\nunder :</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\">           “6.   ………It  envisages  three  circumstances  under  which   the\n           inherent jurisdiction may be  exercised,  namely,  (i)  to  give\n           effect to an order under the Code, (ii) to prevent abuse of  the\n           process of court, and (iii) to  otherwise  secure  the  ends  of\n           justice. It is neither possible nor desirable to  lay  down  any\n           inflexible rule which would  govern  the  exercise  of  inherent\n           jurisdiction. No legislative enactment  dealing  with  procedure\n           can provide for all  cases  that  may  possibly  arise.  Courts,\n           therefore, have inherent powers apart from express provisions of\n           law which are necessary for proper discharge  of  functions  and\n           duties imposed upon them by law.  That  is  the  doctrine  which\n           finds expression in the  section  which  merely  recognizes  and\n           preserves inherent  powers  of  the  High  Courts.  All  courts,\n           whether civil or criminal possess, in the absence of any express\n           provision, as inherent in their constitution, all such powers as\n           are necessary to do the right and to undo a wrong in  course  of\n           administration of justice on the principle  quando  lex  aliquid\n           alicui concedit, concedere videtur et id sine quo res ipsae esse\n           non potest (when the law gives a person anything  it  gives  him\n           that without which it cannot  exist).  While  exercising  powers\n           under the section, the court does not function  as  a  court  of\n           appeal or revision.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1014506\" id=\"span_24\">Inherent  jurisdiction  under  the  section\n           though wide has to be exercised sparingly,  carefully  and  with\n           caution and only when such exercise is justified  by  the  tests\n           specifically <a href=\"/doc/1014506/\" id=\"a_96\">laid down in</a>  the  section  itself.

It  would  be  an  abuse  of\n           process of the court to allow any action which would  result  in\n           injustice and prevent promotion of justice. In exercise  of  the\n           powers court would be justified to quash any  proceeding  if  it\n           finds that initiation/continuance of it amounts to abuse of  the\n           process  of  court  or  quashing  of  these  proceedings   would\n           otherwise serve the ends of justice……..”\n\n\nThe Court in paragraph 9 (Pg. 96) further stated :</span>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">           <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1014506\" id=\"span_25\">“9.  ………the powers possessed by the High Court under Section 482\n           of the Code are very wide and the very plenitude  of  the  power\n           requires great caution in its exercise.

Undoubtedly, the High Court possesses inherent powers under\n           <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_99\">Section 482</a> of the Code of Criminal  Procedure.  These  inherent\n           powers of the High Court are meant to act ex debito justitiae to\n           do real and substantial justice, for the administration of which\n           alone it exists, or to prevent  abuse  of  the  process  of  the\n           court.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">           19.

The  Court  would  be\n           justified in exercising the  power  when  it  is  imperative  to\n           exercise the power in order to prevent injustice.  In  order  to\n           understand the nature and scope of power under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_101\">Section 482</a>  CrPC\n           it has become necessary to recapitulate the ratio of the decided\n           cases.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_50\">           20. Reference to the  following  cases  would  reveal  that  the\n           Courts have consistently taken the view that they must  use  the\n           court&#x27;s extraordinary power only to prevent injustice and secure\n           the ends of justice. We have largely inherited the provisions of\n           inherent powers from the English  jurisprudence,  therefore  the\n           principles decided by the English courts would be  of  relevance\n           for us. It is generally agreed that the Crown Court has inherent\n           power to protect its process from abuse. The English courts have\n           also used inherent power to achieve the same objective.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_51\">           39. Careful analysis of all these judgments clearly reveals that\n           the exercise of inherent powers would  entirely  depend  on  the\n           facts  and  circumstances  of   each   case.   The   object   of\n           incorporating inherent powers in the Code is to prevent abuse of\n           the process of the court or to secure ends of justice.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"558734\" id=\"span_27\">32           In  <a href=\"/doc/558734/\" id=\"a_102\">Devendra  and  others  v.

It is trite that  although\n           the power possessed by the High Court under the  said  provision\n           is very wide but it is not unbridled.

The High Court, in  exercise  of  its  jurisdiction  under\n           <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_143\">Section 482</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, and  this  Court,\n           in terms of <a href=\"/doc/500307/\" id=\"a_144\">Article 142</a> of the Constitution of India, would  not\n           direct quashing of a case involving crime  against  the  society\n           particularly when both the learned Special  Judge  as  also  the\n           High Court have found that a prima facie case has been made  out\n           against the appellant herein for framing the charge.”\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_43\">39.         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1282121\" id=\"span_44\">In Shiji alias <a href=\"/doc/1282121/\" id=\"a_145\">Pappu and  others  vs.  Radhika  and  another</a>[33]\nthis Court considered the exercise of  inherent  power  by  the  High  Court\nunder Section 482 in a matter where the offence was not compoundable as  the\naccused was already involved in commission of the offences punishable  under\n<a href=\"/doc/203036/\" id=\"a_146\">Sections 354</a> and <a href=\"/doc/764237/\" id=\"a_147\">394</a> IPC. The High Court  rejected  the  prayer  by  holding\nthat the offences with    which appellants were charged  are  not  ‘personal\nin nature’ to justify quashing the criminal proceedings on the  basis  of  a\ncompromise arrived at between  the  complainant  and  the  appellants.  This\nCourt considered earlier decisions of this Court, the  provisions  contained\nin Sections 320 and 394 of the Code and in paragraphs 17, 18  and  19  (pgs.\n712 and 713) of the Report held as under:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_62\">           “17. It is manifest  that  simply  because  an  offence  is  not\n           compoundable under <a href=\"/doc/91933/\" id=\"a_148\">Section 320</a> CrPC is by itself no  reason  for\n           the High Court to refuse exercise of its power under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_149\">Section 482</a>\n           CrPC. That power can in our opinion be exercised in cases  where\n           there is no chance of recording a conviction against the accused\n           and the entire exercise of a trial is destined to be an exercise\n           in futility. There is a subtle distinction  between  compounding\n           of offences by the parties before the trial court or  in  appeal\n           on the one hand and the exercise of power by the High  Court  to\n           quash the prosecution under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_150\">Section 482</a> CrPC on the other. While\n           a  court  trying  an  accused  or  hearing  an  appeal   against\n           conviction, may not be competent to  permit  compounding  of  an\n           offence based on a settlement arrived at between the parties  in\n           cases where the offences are not compoundable under Section 320,\n           the High Court may quash the prosecution even in cases where the\n           offences  with  which  the  accused  stand  charged   are   non-\n           compoundable. The  inherent  powers  of  the  High  Court  under\n           <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_151\">Section 482</a> CrPC are not for that purpose controlled by  <a href=\"/doc/91933/\" id=\"a_152\">Section\n           320</a> CrPC.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_63\">           18. Having said so, we must hasten to add that the plenitude  of\n           the power under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_153\">Section 482</a> CrPC by itself, makes it  obligatory\n           for the High Court to exercise the same  with  utmost  care  and\n           caution. The width and the nature of the  power  itself  demands\n           that its exercise is sparing and only in cases  where  the  High\n           Court is, for reasons to be recorded, of  the  clear  view  that\n           continuance of the prosecution would be nothing but an abuse  of\n           the process of law. It is neither necessary nor proper for us to\n           enumerate the situations in which the exercise  of  power  under\n           Section 482 may be justified. All that we need to  say  is  that\n           the exercise of power must be for securing the ends  of  justice\n           and only in cases where  refusal  to  exercise  that  power  may\n           result in the abuse of the process of law. The High Court may be\n           justified in declining interference if  it  is  called  upon  to\n           appreciate  evidence  for  it  cannot  assume  the  role  of  an\n           appellate court while dealing with a petition under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_154\">Section  482</a>\n           of the Criminal Procedure Code. Subject to the above,  the  High\n           Court will have to consider the facts and circumstances of  each\n           case to determine whether it is a fit case in which the inherent\n           powers may be invoked.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_64\">           19. Coming to the case at hand, we are  of  the  view  that  the\n           incident in question had its genesis in a  dispute  relating  to\n           the access to the two plots which are adjacent to each other. It\n           was not a case of broad daylight robbery for gain. It was a case\n           which has its origin in the civil dispute between  the  parties,\n           which dispute has, it appears, been resolved by them. That being\n           so, continuance of the prosecution where the complainant is  not\n           ready to support the allegations which are now described by  her\n           as arising out of some “misunderstanding and misconception” will\n           be  a  futile  exercise  that  will  serve  no  purpose.  It  is\n           noteworthy that the two alleged eyewitnesses,  who  are  closely\n           related to the complainant, are also no longer supportive of the\n           prosecution version. The continuance of the proceedings is  thus\n           nothing but an empty formality. <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_155\">Section 482</a> CrPC could, in  such\n           circumstances, be justifiably  invoked  by  the  High  Court  to\n           prevent abuse of the process of law  and  thereby  preventing  a\n           wasteful exercise by the courts below”.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_65\">40.          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"96245872\" id=\"span_45\">In  <a href=\"/doc/96245872/\" id=\"a_156\">Ashok  Sadarangani  and  Anr.  vs.  Union  of   India   and\nothers</a>[34],  the issue under consideration was whether an offence which  was\nnot compoundable under the provisions of the Code could be  quashed.    That\nwas a case where   a  criminal case   was  registered  against  the  accused\npersons under <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_157\">Sections 120-B</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1317063/\" id=\"a_158\">465</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1985627/\" id=\"a_159\">467</a>, <a href=\"/doc/556166/\" id=\"a_160\">468</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1466184/\" id=\"a_161\">471</a> of IPC.

The power under  <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_216\">Section  482</a>\n           of the Cr.P.C. is to be exercised ex-debito Justitiae to prevent\n           an abuse of process of Court.

It  will  always  depend\n           upon the facts and circumstances of each case. The  power  under\n           <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_217\">Section 482</a> of the Cr.P.C. has  no  limits.  However,  the  High\n           Court will exercise  it  sparingly  and  with  utmost  care  and\n           caution. The exercise of power has to be with circumspection and\n           restraint. The Court is a vital and an extra-ordinary  effective\n           instrument to maintain and control social order. The Courts play\n           role of paramount importance in  achieving  peace,  harmony  and\n           ever-lasting congeniality in society. Resolution of a dispute by\n           way of a  compromise  between  two  warring  groups,  therefore,\n           should attract the immediate and prompt  attention  of  a  Court\n           which should endeavour to give full effect to  the  same  unless\n           such compromise  is  abhorrent  to  lawful  composition  of  the\n           society or would promote savagery.”\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_50\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1365975\" id=\"span_68\">46.         A three-Judge Bench of the Bombay High Court in  <a href=\"/doc/1365975/\" id=\"a_218\">Abasaheb  Yadav\nHonmane v. State of Maharashtra</a>[40] dealt with the  inherent  power  of  the\nHigh Court under Section 482 of the  Code  vis-à-vis  the  express  bar  for\ncompounding of the non-compoundable offences in Section 320(9) of the  Code.\nThe High Court referred to various decisions of  this  Court  and  also  the\ndecisions of the various High Courts and then stated as follows :</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_83\">            “The power of compounding on one hand and quashing of  criminal\n           proceedings in exercise of inherent powers  on  the  other,  are\n           incapable  of  being  treated  as  synonymous  or  even   inter-\n           changeable in law. The conditions precedent and satisfaction  of\n           criteria in each of these cases are distinct and different.  May\n           be, the only aspect where  they  have  any  commonality  is  the\n           result of exercise of such power in favour of  the  accused,  as\n           acquittal is the end result in  both  these  cases.  Both  these\n           powers are to be exercised  for  valid  grounds  and  with  some\n           element of objectivity. Particularly, the power of quashing  the\n           FIR or criminal proceedings by the Court by taking  recourse  to\n           inherent powers is expected to be used sparingly  and  that  too\n           without losing sight of impact of such  order  on  the  criminal\n           justice delivery system. It may be obligatory upon the Court  to\n           strike a balance between the nature of the offence and the  need\n           to pass an order in exercise of inherent powers, as  the  object\n           of criminal law is protection of public by  maintenance  of  law\n           and order.”\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_51\">47.         Section 320 of the Code articulates public  policy  with  regard\nto the compounding of offences. It catalogues the offences punishable  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_219\">IPC</a> which may be compounded by the parties without permission of  the  Court\nand the composition of certain offences with the permission  of  the  court.\nThe offences punishable under  the  special  statutes  are  not  covered  by\nSection 320.   When an offence is compoundable under Section 320,  abatement\nof such offence or an attempt to commit such offence or  where  the  accused\nis liable under Section 34 or 149 of the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_220\">IPC</a> can also be compounded  in  the\nsame manner. A person who is under 18 years of age  or  is  an  idiot  or  a\nlunatic is not competent to contract compounding of  offence  but  the  same\ncan be done on his behalf with the permission of the court.  If a person  is\notherwise  competent  to  compound   an   offence   is   dead,   his   legal\nrepresentatives may also compound the offence with  the  permission  of  the\ncourt.  Where the accused has been  committed  for  trial  or  he  has  been\nconvicted and the appeal is pending, composition can only be done  with  the\nleave of the court to which he has been committed or with the leave  of  the\nappeal court, as the case may be.  The revisional court  is  also  competent\nto allow any person to compound any offence who is  competent  to  compound.\nThe consequence of the  composition  of  an  offence  is  acquittal  of  the\naccused. Sub-section (9) of Section 320 mandates that no  offence  shall  be\ncompounded except as provided by this Section. Obviously,  in  view  thereof\nthe composition of an offence has to be in accord with Section  320  and  in\nno other manner.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_52\">48.         The question is with regard to the inherent power  of  the  High\nCourt in quashing the criminal  proceedings  against  an  offender  who  has\nsettled his dispute with the victim of the crime but the crime in  which  he\nis allegedly involved is not compoundable under Section 320 of the Code.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_53\">49.         Section 482 of the Code, as its very  language  suggests,  saves\nthe inherent power of the High Court which it has by virtue of  it  being  a\nsuperior court to prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise  to\nsecure the ends of justice. It begins  with  the  words,  ‘nothing  in  this\nCode’ which means that the provision  is  an  overriding  provision.   These\nwords leave no manner of doubt that none  of  the  provisions  of  the  Code\nlimits or restricts the inherent power. The guideline for exercise  of  such\npower is provided in Section 482  itself  i.e.,  to  prevent  abuse  of  the\nprocess of any court or otherwise to secure the ends  of  justice.   As  has\nbeen repeatedly stated that Section  482  confers  no  new  powers  on  High\nCourt; it merely safeguards  existing  inherent  powers  possessed  by  High\nCourt necessary to prevent abuse of the process of any Court  or  to  secure\nthe ends of justice.   It is equally well settled that the power is  not  to\nbe resorted to if there is specific provision in the Code  for  the  redress\nof the grievance  of  an  aggrieved  party.  It  should  be  exercised  very\nsparingly and it should not be exercised as against the express bar  of  law\nengrafted in any other provision of the Code.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_54\">50.         In different situations, the inherent power may be exercised  in\ndifferent ways to achieve its ultimate objective. Formation  of  opinion  by\nthe High Court before it exercises  inherent  power  under  Section  482  on\neither of the twin objectives, (i) to prevent abuse of the  process  of  any\ncourt or (ii) to secure the ends of justice, is a sine qua non.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_55\">51.         In the very nature of  its  constitution,  it  is  the  judicial\nobligation of the High Court to undo a wrong in course of administration  of\njustice or to prevent continuation of unnecessary judicial process. This  is\nfounded on the legal maxim quando lex aliquid  alicui  concedit,  conceditur\net id sine qua res ipsa esse non  potest.   The  full  import  of  which  is\nwhenever anything is authorised, and especially if, as  a  matter  of  duty,\nrequired to be done by law, it is found impossible to do that  thing  unless\nsomething else not authorised in express terms be also  done,  may  also  be\ndone, then that something else will be supplied  by  necessary   intendment.\nEx debito justitiae is inbuilt in such exercise; the whole  idea  is  to  do\nreal, complete and substantial  justice  for  which  it  exists.  The  power\npossessed by the High Court under  Section  482  of  the  Code  is  of  wide\namplitude but requires exercise with great caution and circumspection.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_56\">52.         It needs no emphasis that exercise  of  inherent  power  by  the\nHigh Court would entirely depend on the  facts  and  circumstances  of  each\ncase. It is neither permissible nor  proper  for  the  court  to  provide  a\nstraitjacket formula  regulating  the  exercise  of  inherent  powers  under\nSection 482. No precise and inflexible guidelines can also be provided.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_57\">53.         Quashing of offence or criminal proceedings  on  the  ground  of\nsettlement between  an  offender  and  victim  is  not  the  same  thing  as\ncompounding  of  offence.  They  are  different  and  not   interchangeable.\nStrictly speaking, the power of compounding of offences  given  to  a  court\nunder Section 320 is materially different  from  the  quashing  of  criminal\nproceedings by the High Court in exercise of its inherent  jurisdiction.  In\ncompounding of offences, power of a criminal court is circumscribed  by  the\nprovisions contained in Section 320 and  the  court  is  guided  solely  and\nsquarely thereby while, on the other hand, the formation of opinion  by  the\nHigh Court for quashing  a   criminal  offence  or  criminal  proceeding  or\ncriminal complaint is guided by the material on record  as  to  whether  the\nends of justice would justify such exercise of power although  the  ultimate\nconsequence may be acquittal or dismissal of indictment.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_58\">54.         Where High Court quashes a criminal proceeding having regard  to\nthe fact that dispute between the  offender  and  victim  has  been  settled\nalthough offences are not compoundable,  it  does  so  as  in  its  opinion,\ncontinuation of  criminal proceedings will  be an exercise in  futility  and\njustice in the case demands that the dispute between the parties is  put  to\nan end and peace is restored;  securing  the  ends  of  justice  being   the\nultimate guiding factor. No  doubt,  crimes  are  acts  which  have  harmful\neffect on the public and consist in wrong  doing  that  seriously  endangers\nand threatens well-being of society and it is not safe to leave  the  crime-\ndoer only because he and the victim have settled  the  dispute  amicably  or\nthat the victim has been paid compensation, yet  certain  crimes  have  been\nmade compoundable in law, with or  without  permission  of  the  Court.   In\nrespect of serious offences  like  murder,  rape,  dacoity,  etc;  or  other\noffences of mental depravity under <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_221\">IPC</a> or offences of moral turpitude  under\nspecial  statutes,  like  <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_222\">Prevention  of  Corruption  Act</a>  or  the  offences\ncommitted by public servants while working in that capacity, the  settlement\nbetween offender and victim can have no legal sanction  at  all.    However,\ncertain offences which overwhelmingly and predominantly bear  civil  flavour\nhaving arisen out of civil, mercantile, commercial,  financial,  partnership\nor such  like  transactions  or  the  offences  arising  out  of  matrimony,\nparticularly relating to dowry, etc.  or  the   family  dispute,  where  the\nwrong is basically to victim and the offender and victim  have  settled  all\ndisputes between them amicably, irrespective of the fact that such  offences\nhave not been made compoundable, the High Court may within the framework  of\nits inherent power, quash the criminal proceeding or criminal  complaint  or\nF.I.R if it is satisfied that on the  face  of  such  settlement,  there  is\nhardly any likelihood of offender being convicted and by  not  quashing  the\ncriminal proceedings, justice shall be  casualty and  ends of justice  shall\nbe defeated. The above list is illustrative and not exhaustive.   Each  case\nwill depend on  its  own  facts  and  no  hard  and  fast  category  can  be\nprescribed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_59\">55.         B.S. Joshi1, Nikhil Merchant2, Manoj  Sharma3  and  Shiji  alias\nPappu33 do illustrate the principle  that  High  Court  may  quash  criminal\nproceedings or FIR or complaint in exercise  of  its  inherent  power  under\nSection 482 of the Code and Section 320 does not limit or affect the  powers\nof the High Court under Section  482.  Can  it  be  said  that  by  quashing\ncriminal proceedings in B.S. Joshi1, Nikhil  Merchant2,  Manoj  Sharma3  and\nShiji  alias  Pappu33,  this  Court  has  compounded  the   non-compoundable\noffences indirectly? We do not think so.  There does exist  the  distinction\nbetween compounding of an offence  under  Section  320  and  quashing  of  a\ncriminal case by the High Court in exercise of inherent power under  Section\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_60\">482.   The  two  powers  are  distinct  and  different   although   ultimate\nconsequence may be same viz., acquittal  of  the  accused  or  dismissal  of\nindictment.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_61\">56.    We find no  incongruity  in  the  above  principle  of  law  and  the\ndecisions  of  this  Court  in  Simrikhia14,   Dharampal15,   Arun   Shankar\nShukla16, Ishwar Singh23, Rumi Dhar (Smt.).28 and Ashok  Sadarangani34.  The\nprinciple propounded in Simrikhia14 that the inherent  jurisdiction  of  the\nHigh Court cannot be invoked to override express bar provided in law  is  by\nnow well settled. In Dharampal15, the Court observed  the  same  thing  that\nthe inherent powers under Section 482 of the Code  cannot  be  utilized  for\nexercising  powers  which  are  expressly  barred  by  the  Code.    Similar\nstatement of law is made in Arun Shankar Shukla16. In  Ishwar  Singh23,  the\naccused was alleged to have committed an offence  punishable  under  <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_223\">Section\n307</a>, IPC and with reference to Section 320 of the Code,  it  was  held  that\nthe offence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_224\">Section 307</a> IPC was  not  compoundable  offence\nand there  was  express  bar  in  Section  320  that  no  offence  shall  be\ncompounded if it is not compoundable under the Code. In Rumi  Dhar  (Smt.)28\nalthough the accused had paid the entire due amount as  per  the  settlement\nwith the bank in the matter of recovery before the Debts Recovery  Tribunal,\nthe accused was being  proceeded  with  for  commission  of  offences  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_225\">Section 120-B</a>/<a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_226\">420</a>/<a href=\"/doc/1985627/\" id=\"a_227\">467</a>/<a href=\"/doc/556166/\" id=\"a_228\">468</a>/<a href=\"/doc/1466184/\" id=\"a_229\">471</a> of the IPC along with the  bank  officers  who\nwere being prosecuted under <a href=\"/doc/1259316/\" id=\"a_230\">Section 13(2)</a> read with 13(1)(d)  of  <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_231\">Prevention\nof Corruption Act</a>. The  Court  refused  to  quash  the  charge  against  the\naccused by holding that the Court would not quash a case involving  a  crime\nagainst the society when a prima facie case has been made  out  against  the\naccused for framing the charge. Ashok Sadarangani34  was again a case  where\nthe  accused  persons  were  charged  of  having  committed  offences  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_232\">Sections 120-B</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1317063/\" id=\"a_233\">465</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1985627/\" id=\"a_234\">467</a>, <a href=\"/doc/556166/\" id=\"a_235\">468</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1466184/\" id=\"a_236\">471</a>, IPC and  the  allegations  were  that\nthe accused  secured the credit facilities  by  submitting  forged  property\ndocuments as collaterals and utilized such facilities in  a   dishonest  and\nfraudulent manner by  opening  letters  of  credit  in  respect  of  foreign\nsupplies of goods, without actually bringing  any  goods  but  inducing  the\nbank to negotiate the letters of credit in favour of foreign  suppliers  and\nalso by misusing the cash-credit  facility.  The  Court  was  alive  to  the\nreference made in one of the present matters and also the decisions in  B.S.\nJoshi1, Nikhil Merchant2 and  Manoj  Sharma3  and  it  was  held  that  B.S.\nJoshi1, and Nikhil Merchant2 dealt with different factual situation  as  the\ndispute involved had overtures  of  a  civil  dispute  but  the  case  under\nconsideration in Ashok Sadarangani34 was more on the  criminal  intent  than\non a civil aspect.  The decision in Ashok Sadarangani34  supports  the  view\nthat the criminal matters involving overtures of a civil dispute stand on  a\ndifferent footing.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_62\">57.         The position that emerges  from  the  above  discussion  can  be\nsummarised thus:  the power  of  the  High  Court  in  quashing  a  criminal\nproceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its inherent  jurisdiction  is\ndistinct and different  from  the  power  given  to  a  criminal  court  for\ncompounding the offences under Section 320 of the Code.  Inherent  power  is\nof wide plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has  to  be  exercised\nin accord with the guideline engrafted in such power viz; (i) to secure  the\nends of justice or (ii) to prevent  abuse of the process of  any  Court.  In\nwhat cases power to quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R  may\nbe exercised where the offender and victim have settled their dispute  would\ndepend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no  category  can  be\nprescribed. However, before exercise of such  power,  the  High  Court  must\nhave due regard to the nature and gravity of the crime. Heinous and  serious\noffences of mental depravity or offences like murder,  rape,  dacoity,  etc.\ncannot be fittingly quashed even though the victim or  victim’s  family  and\nthe offender have settled the dispute. Such  offences  are  not  private  in\nnature and  have  serious  impact  on  society.  Similarly,  any  compromise\nbetween the victim and offender  in relation to the offences  under  special\nstatutes like <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_237\">Prevention of Corruption Act</a>  or  the  offences  committed  by\npublic servants while working in that capacity etc; cannot provide  for  any\nbasis for quashing criminal proceedings involving  such  offences.  But  the\ncriminal cases having  overwhelmingly  and  pre-dominatingly  civil  flavour\nstand on different footing for the purposes of  quashing,  particularly  the\noffences arising from commercial, financial, mercantile, civil,  partnership\nor such like transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony  relating\nto dowry, etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is  basically  private\nor personal in nature and the parties have resolved  their  entire  dispute.\nIn this category of cases, High Court may quash criminal proceedings  if  in\nits view, because of the compromise between the  offender  and  victim,  the\npossibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation  of  criminal\ncase would put  accused  to  great  oppression  and  prejudice  and  extreme\ninjustice would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal  case  despite\nfull and complete settlement  and  compromise  with  the  victim.  In  other\nwords, the High Court must consider whether it would be unfair  or  contrary\nto the interest of justice to  continue  with  the  criminal  proceeding  or\ncontinuation of  the  criminal  proceeding  would  tantamount  to  abuse  of\nprocess of law despite settlement and  compromise  between  the  victim  and\nwrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate  that\ncriminal case is put to an end and if the answer to  the  above  question(s)\nis in affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its  jurisdiction  to\nquash the criminal proceeding.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_63\">58.
