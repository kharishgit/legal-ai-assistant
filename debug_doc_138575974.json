He   is   an   honest   and   hardworking   officer   and   has \n\n\ntaken   drastic   steps   to   curb   terrorism   in   the   State   in   early   1990s.   The \n\n\nterrorists had planned a diabolical act and an attempt was made on his \n\n\nlife,   wherein   his   three   bodyguards   were   killed   and   three   others   were \n\n\nseriously   injured.   The   officer   himself   suffered   grievous   injuries.   The \n\n\nterrorists had also even chased him up to England when he went there \n\n\nfor a social visit. They had planned to attack the said officer. They were \n\n\narrested   by   the   police   and   put   to   trial   and   also   stood   convicted.

More so, as the judgment in \n\n\nappeal   against   acquittal   had   been   passed   by   the   Court   on   11.5.2007 \n\n\nupholding   the   judgment   of   acquittal,   the   Court   has   become  functus  \n\n\nofficio  and   it had no competence to reopen the case vide order dated \n\n\n30.5.2007.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">6.

More so, the proceedings that continued after \n\n\nthe   said   judgment,   by   illegally   reopening   the   case,   were   a   result   of \n\n\njudicial bias of  Mr. Justice X, which was just  to take revenge against \n\n\nShri S.S. Saini, who had conducted an inquiry against Mr. Justice X and \n\n\nthus, all such proceedings are liable to be quashed. None of the parties \n\n\nhad ever named Mr. S.S. Saini in connection with any of the cases.   It  \n\n\nwas   Mr.   Justice   X,   who,   on   his   personal   knowledge,   mentioned   his \n\n\nname in court order dated 5.10.2007.  Such a course is not permissible \n\n\nin law.  More so, so far as Balwant Singh Multani&#x27;s case is concerned, \n\n\nhis   father   Darshan   Singh   Multani   (at   the   relevant   time   an   officer   of \n\n\nIndian Administrative Service) had approached the High Court for the \n\n\nsame  relief and the case stood dismissed in the year 1991 and he had \n\n\nnot   taken   up   the   matter   any   further.     Thus,   the   proceedings   attained \n\n\nfinality.    Application  of Mr.  Multani   could  not  have  been   entertained \n\n\nafter the expiry of 16 years.  The same position existed in respect of the \n\n\napplication   filed   by   Davinder   Pal   Singh   Bhullar   (who   had   been \n\n\nconvicted and awarded a death sentence in another case and the same \n\n\nstood   confirmed   by   this   Court)   in   respect   of   abduction   of   his   father \n\n\nBalwant Singh Bhullar and uncle Manjit Singh in the year 1991 without \n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                                                                      1</span>\n\n\f\nfurnishing any explanation for delay of 16 years. More so, Mrs. Jagir \n\n\nKaur, sister of Balwant Singh Bhullar, had filed Crl. W.P. No. 1062 of \n\n\n1997 for production of Balwant Singh Bhullar, which stood dismissed \n\n\nvide order dated 15.7.1997 only on the ground of delay. A second writ \n\n\npetition   for  habeas   corpus  is   not   maintainable   and   is   barred     by   the \n\n\nprinciples of res judicata. The CBI submitted that investigation of  the \n\n\nsaid alleged abduction be not tagged with that of the involvement of the \n\n\nofficer   and   disappearance   of   Balwant   Singh   Multani,   as   both   the \n\n\nincidents   were   separate   and   independent   and   had   no   connection   with \n\n\neach other. The High Court after taking note of the said submissions in \n\n\nits   order   dated   6.11.2007   illegally   clubbed   both   the   said   applications. \n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_22\">The   applications   filed   by   Davinder   Pal   Singh   Bhullar   and   Darshan \n\n\nSingh Multani could not be filed/entertained in the disposed of criminal \n\n\nappeal.   Had   the   said   applications   been   filed   independently,   the   same \n\n\ncould   be   rejected   as   being   filed   at   a   much   belated   stage.   Even \n\n\notherwise, the said applications could have gone to a different Bench. \n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\">Thus,   by   entertaining   those   applications   in   a   disposed   of   criminal \n\n\nappeal, the Bench presided over by Mr. Justice X   violated the roster \n\n\nfixed   by   the   Chief   Justice.   Thus,   the   proceedings   are   liable   to   be \n\n\nquashed.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                                                                     1</span>\n\n\f\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_24\">8.

The   two-fold   aim   of \n\n\ncriminal   justice   is   that   &quot;guilt   shall   not   escape   nor   innocence   suffer.&quot; \n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_25\">Allegations made against the Presiding Judge are scandalous and false \n\n\nand do not require any consideration whatsoever.

It  is wrong  that  his  name   has been \n\n\nadded by the Presiding Judge in the Bench for his personal revenge on \n\n\nhis personal knowledge. So far as names of two proclaimed offenders, \n\n\nwho   had   been   killed   in   an   encounter   are   concerned,   it   has   been \n\n\nmentioned   in   the   chargesheet   itself   that   Navneet   Singh   and   Gurjant \n\n\nSingh, proclaimed  offenders, had been killed in encounters. However, \n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                                                                          1</span>\n\n\f\nsuch fact could not be brought to the notice of the High Court by the  \n\n\npublic   prosecutor.   The   State   of   Punjab   filed   an   application   for \n\n\nintervention but did not raise any issue of bias or prejudice against the \n\n\nPresiding Judge of  the Bench. The Union Territory of Chandigarh has \n\n\napproached this Court against the same impugned judgment and order \n\n\nand special leave petition has been dismissed  in limine.

The test of real likelihood of bias is whether a reasonable person, \n\n\nin possession of relevant information, would have thought that bias was \n\n\nlikely and whether the adjudicator was likely to be disposed to decide \n\n\nthe  matter  only   in  a  particular  way.    Public   policy   requires that  there \n\n\nshould   be   no   doubt   about   the   purity   of   the   adjudication \n\n\nprocess/administration of justice.   The Court has to proceed observing \n\n\nthe   minimal   requirements   of  natural   justice,   i.e.,   the   Judge   has   to   act \n\n\nfairly   and   without   bias   and   in   good   faith.     A   judgment   which   is   the \n\n\nresult of bias or want of impartiality, is a nullity and the trial  &quot;coram  \n\n\nnon judice&quot;.

He   cannot   act   as  \n\n         Judge   of   a   cause   in   which   he   himself   has   some  \n\n         interest   either  pecuniary   or  otherwise   as  it   affords  \n\n         the strongest proof against neutrality.

This     rule     applies     to     the  \n\n         judicial   and     administrative     authorities required  \n\n         to act judicially or quasi-judicially.&quot;  \n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_52\">20.    Thus, it is evident that the allegations of judicial bias are required \n\n\n       to   be   scrutinised   taking   into   consideration   the   factual   matrix   of \n\n\n       the case in hand. The court must bear in mind that a mere ground \n\n\n       of appearance of bias and not actual bias is enough to vitiate the \n\n\n       judgment/order.   Actual   proof   of   prejudice   in   such   a   case   may \n\n\n       make the case of the party concerned stronger, but such a proof is \n\n\n       not required. In fact, what is relevant is the reasonableness of the \n\n\n       apprehension   in   that   regard   in   the   mind   of   the   party.   However, \n\n\n       once   such   an   apprehension   exists,   the   trial/judgment/order   etc. \n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">                                                                                       2</span>\n\n\f\n       stands vitiated for want of impartiality.

DOCTRINE OF WAIVER:\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_54\">21.      In  Manak   Lal  (Supra),   this   Court   held   that   alleged   bias   of   a \n\n\nJudge/official/Tribunal does not render the proceedings invalid if it is \n\n\nshown   that   the   objection   in   that   regard   and   particularly   against   the \n\n\npresence of the said official in question, had not been taken by the party \n\n\neven though the party knew about the circumstances giving rise to the \n\n\nallegations   about   the   alleged   bias   and   was   aware   of   its   right   to \n\n\nchallenge the presence of such official. The Court further observed that \n\n\nwaiver   cannot   always   and   in   every   case   be   inferred   merely   from   the \n\n\nfailure of the party to take the objection.  &quot;Waiver can be inferred only \n\n\nif and after it is shown that the party knew about the relevant facts and \n\n\nwas aware of his right to take the objection in question.&quot;   \n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_55\">                 Thus, in a given case if a party knows the material facts and is  \n\n\nconscious of his legal rights in that matter, but fails to take the plea of \n\n\nbias at the earlier stage of the proceedings, it creates an effective bar of \n\n\nwaiver against him.  In such facts and circumstances, it would be clear \n\n\nthat the party wanted to take a chance to secure a favourable order from \n\n\nthe   official/court   and   when   he   found   that   he   was   confronted   with   an \n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">                                                                                     2</span>\n\n\f\nunfavourable order, he adopted the device of raising the issue of bias. \n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_56\">The issue of bias must be raised by the party at the earliest. \n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_57\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"82872698\" id=\"span_35\">(See:  M/s. <a href=\"/doc/82872698/\" id=\"a_45\">Pannalal Binjraj &amp; Ors. v.

It   is   evident   from   the   above   that   inherent   powers   can   be \n\n\nexercised only to prevent the abuse of the process of the court and to \n\n\nsecure the ends of justice. However, powers can be used provided there \n\n\nis   no   prohibition   for   passing   such   an   order   under   the   provisions   of \n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_107\">Cr.P.C</a>.   and   there   is   no   provision   under   which   the   party   can   seek \n\n\nredressal of its grievance. Under the garb of exercising inherent powers, \n\n\nthe   Criminal   Court   cannot   review   its   judgment.   Such   powers   are \n\n\nanalogous to the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/56600062/\" id=\"a_108\">Section 151</a> CPC and can be exercised \n\n\nonly to do real and substantial justice. The rule of inherent powers has \n\n\nits source in the maxim  &quot;Quadolex aliquid alicui   concedit, concedere  \n\n\nvidetur id sine quo ipsa, ess uon potest&quot; which means that when the law \n\n\ngives anything to anyone, it gives also all those things without which \n\n\nthe thing itself could not exist. The order cannot be passed by-passing \n\n\nthe   procedure   prescribed   by   law.   The   court   in   exercise   of   its   power \n\n\nunder   <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_109\">Section   482</a>   Cr.P.C.   cannot   direct   a   particular   agency   to \n\n\ninvestigate the matter or to investigate a case from a particular angle or \n\n\nby   a   procedure   not   prescribed   in   <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_110\">Cr.P.C</a>.

The High Court under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_111\">Section 482</a> \n\n\nCr.P.C. is crowned with a statutory power to exercise control over the \n\n\nadministration   of   justice   in   criminal   proceedings   within   its   territorial \n\n\njurisdiction.   This   is   to   ensure   that   proceedings   undertaken   under   the \n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_112\">Cr.P.C</a>.   are   executed   to   secure   the   ends   of   justice.   For   this,   the \n\n\nLegislature has empowered the High Court with an inherent authority \n\n\nwhich is repository under the Statute.  The Legislature therefore clearly \n\n\nintended   the   existence   of   such   power   in   the   High   Court   to   control \n\n\nproceedings   initiated   under   the   <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_113\">Cr.P.C</a>.   Conferment   of   such   inherent \n\n\npower might be   necessary to prevent the miscarriage of justice and to \n\n\nprevent any form of injustice. However, it is to be understood that it is \n\n\nneither   divine   nor   limitless.   It   is   not   to   generate   unnecessary \n\n\nindulgence.   The   power   is   to   protect   the   system   of   justice   from   being \n\n\npolluted during the administration of justice under the Code.  The High \n\n\nCourt can intervene where it finds the abuse of the process of any court  \n\n\nwhich means, that wherever an attempt to secure something by abusing \n\n\nthe   process   is   located,   the   same   can   be   rectified   by   invoking   such \n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_79\">                                                                                      3</span>\n\n\f\npower.  There has to be a nexus and a direct co-relation to any existing  \n\n\nproceeding,   not   foreclosed   by   any   other   form   under   the   Code,   to   the \n\n\nsubject matter for which such power is to be exercised.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_94\">        Application under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_114\">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. lies before the High Court \n\n\nagainst   an   order   passed   by   the   court   subordinate   to   it   in   a   pending \n\n\ncase/proceedings.     Generally,   such   powers   are   used   for   quashing \n\n\ncriminal proceedings in appropriate cases.  Such an application does not \n\n\nlie   to   initiate   criminal   proceedings   or   set   the   criminal   law   in   motion. \n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_95\">Inherent   jurisdiction   can   be   exercised   if   the   order   of   the   Subordinate \n\n\nCourt results in the abuse of the &quot;process&quot; of the court and/or calls for \n\n\ninterference   to  secure  the  ends  of  justice.

Inherent   jurisdiction   can   be   exercised   if \n\n\ninjustice   done   to   a   party,   e.g.,   a   clear   mandatory   provision   of   law   is \n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_80\">                                                                                          3</span>\n\n\f\noverlooked   or   where   different   accused   in   the   same   case   are   being \n\n\ntreated differently by the Subordinate Court.   \n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_97\">         An   inherent   power   is   not   an     omnibus   for   opening   a \n\n\npandorabox, that too for issues that are foreign to the main context.  The \n\n\ninvoking of the power has to be for a purpose   that is connected to a \n\n\nproceeding   and   not   for   sprouting   an     altogether   new   issue.   A   power \n\n\ncannot exceed its own authority beyond its own creation.  It is not that a \n\n\nperson is remediless. On the contrary, the constitutional remedy of writs \n\n\nare available.

Strict  \n\n\nadherence   of   this   procedure   is   essential   for   maintaining   judicial \n\n\ndiscipline and proper functioning of the Court. No departure from this \n\n\nprocedure is permissible.</span></span></span></span></span></span>\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_104\">          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1233173\" id=\"span_91\">In  <a href=\"/doc/1233173/\" id=\"a_126\">Prakash   Chand</a>  (Supra),   this   Court   dealt   with   a   case \n\n\nwherein   the   Chief   Justice   of   Rajasthan   High   Court   had   withdrawn   a \n\n\npart-heard   matter   from   one   Bench   and   directed   it   to   be   listed   before \n\n\nanother   Bench.

Thus,   in   view   of   the   above,   it   is   evident   that   a   constitutional \n\n\ncourt can direct the CBI to investigate into the case provided the court \n\n\nafter   examining   the   allegations   in   the   complaint   reaches   a   conclusion \n\n\nthat   the   complainant   could   make   out   prima   facie,   a   case   against   the \n\n\naccused.     However,   the   person   against   whom   the   investigation   is \n\n\nsought, is to be impleaded  as a party and must  be given a reasonable \n\n\nopportunity of being heard.   CBI cannot be directed to have a roving \n\n\ninquiry   as   to   whether   a   person   was   involved   in   the   alleged   unlawful \n\n\nactivities.    The  court can  direct CBI  investigation only in exceptional \n\n\ncircumstances   where   the   court   is   of   the   view   that   the   accusation   is \n\n\nagainst   a   person   who   by   virtue   of   his   post   could   influence   the \n\n\ninvestigation and it may prejudice the cause of the complainant, and it \n\n\nis   necessary   so   to   do   in   order   to   do   complete   justice   and   make   the  \n\n\ninvestigation credible.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_116\">INSTANT CASES :\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_117\">49.

It is evident from the judgment and order dated 11.5.2007 that \n\n\nCriminal Misc. No.152-MA of 2007 stood dismissed.  The order sheet \n\n\ndated 30.5.2007 reveals that in spite of the disposal of the said criminal \n\n\nappeal it had been marked therein as &quot;put up for further hearing&quot; and \n\n\nthe order dated 30.5.2007 reveals the directions given to the Trial Court \n\n\nto furnish a detailed report as to the measures taken by it to bring the \n\n\nproclaimed   offenders,   namely   Navneet   Singh,   Manjit   Singh, \n\n\nManmohan Singh, Gurjant Singh and Balwant Singh before the Court \n\n\nand the case was adjourned for 2nd July, 2007. \n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_119\">51.

While   in   another   copy,   it   is   not   in   the   order   sheet \n\n\ndated 11.5.2007 but on the order sheet dated 30.5.2007. In view of this \n\n\nconfusion,   this   Court   vide   order   dated   17.3.2011   has   called   for   the \n\n\noriginal record.

However,   the   case   was   adjourned   for   19.9.2007.

The   Police   by   filing   the   replies   had   adopted   the   delaying \n\n\ntactics   only   to   derail   the   process   of   the   court   without   bringing   the \n\n\nproclaimed   offenders   to   justice.

The CBI was further directed to investigate the \n\n\ncase   properly,   as   no   worthwhile   steps   were   being   taken   by   the \n\n\nChandigarh Police. \n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_108\">                                                                                        4</span>\n\n\f\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_121\">             The order dated 5.10.2007 passed by the Bench shows that the \n\n\nCBI had been impleaded as  respondent in the petition suo motu by the \n\n\ncourt.     The   CBI   submitted   its   reply   to   the   Crl.Misc.

The   matter   suddenly \n\n\nappeared   before   the   Bench   on   30.5.2007   and   the   Court   directed   the \n\n\nPolice to furnish information regarding the proclaimed offenders and a \n\n\ndetailed report as to the measures taken to procure the presence of  the \n\n\nsaid   proclaimed   offenders,   namely,   Navneet   Singh,   Manjit   Singh, \n\n\nManmohan Singh, Gurjant Singh and Balwant Singh so that they may  \n\n\nface  trial.   However, after hearing the matter  on few  dates,  the  Court \n\n\nvide order dated 5.10.2007 closed the chapter of proclaimed offenders \n\n\nobserving as under:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">          &quot;Since   the   police   of   U.T.   Chandigarh   has   now  \n\n          woken up, that the proclaimed offenders have to be  \n\n          brought to justice and are making efforts to procure  \n\n          their presence, we feel that there is no need for the  \n\n          Special   Investigation   Team   (S.I.T.)     The   Inspector  \n\n          General of Police, Union Territory, Chandigarh had  \n\n          been   directed   by   this   Court   vide   order   dated  \n\n          5.9.2007   to   set   up   a   Special   Investigation   Team  \n\n          (S.I.T.) for this purpose.  At this stage, now, there is  \n\n          no   need   for   this   Special   Investigation   Team.    The  \n\n          Inspector   General   of   Police,   UT,   Chandigarh   is  \n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_111\">                                                                                       5</span>\n\n\f\n         directed to disband the Special Investigation Team \n\n         and   proceed   as   per   law   in   the   normal   course   to  \n\n         procure   the   presence   of   the   proclaimed   offenders,  \n\n         who are allegedly in foreign countries.&quot;   (Emphasis \n\n         added) \n\n\n\n\n          Therefore, it is evident that the court was very much anxious to  \n\n\nknow   about   the   proclaimed   offenders,   however,   after   getting   certain \n\n\ninformation, the Court stopped monitoring the progress in procuring the \n\n\npresence of any of those proclaimed offenders.  By this time, the Court  \n\n\nalso came to know that applicant Darshan Singh Multani&#x27;s son had also \n\n\nbeen killed.  Therefore, the chapter regarding the proclaimed offenders \n\n\nwas closed. There was no occasion for the Court to proceed further with \n\n\nthe   matter   and   entertain   the   applications   under   <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_137\">Section   482</a>   Cr.P.C., \n\n\nfiled  by  Darshan  Singh Multani  and  Davinder Pal  Singh  Bhullar.    At \n\n\nthis stage, the Court started probing regarding  missing  persons.   The \n\n\nquestion   does   arise   as   to   whether   applications   under   <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_138\">Section   482</a> \n\n\nCr.P.C. could be entertained in a disposed of appeal or could be  heard \n\n\nby a Bench to which the roster has not been assigned by Hon&#x27;ble the \n\n\nChief Justice.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_129\">         In view of the law referred to hereinabove, the Bench was not \n\n\ncompetent  to entertain the said applications and even if the same  had \n\n\nbeen   filed  in  the  disposed  of  appeal,  the  court  could  have  directed  to \n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_112\">                                                                                  5</span>\n\n\f\nplace   the   said   applications   before   the   Bench   dealing   with   similar \n\n\npetitions.   \n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_130\">55.       It is evident from the order dated 30.5.2007 that in spite of the \n\n\nfact   that   the   appeal   stood   disposed   of   vide   judgment   and   order   dated \n\n\n11.5.2007,   there   appears   an   order   in   the   file:   &quot;put   up   for   further \n\n\nhearing&quot;.     That   means   the   matter   is   to   be   heard   by   the   same   Bench \n\n\nconsisting   of   Judges   `X&#x27;   and   `A&#x27;.     However,   the   matter   was   listed \n\n\nbefore another Bench on 2.7.2007 and the said Bench directed to list the \n\n\nmatter before DB-IV after taking the appropriate order from the Chief \n\n\nJustice.  In absence of the  Chief Justice, the senior most Judge passed \n\n\nthe order on 5.7.2007 to list the matter before the DB-IV. The matter  \n\n\nremained   with   the   Presiding   Judge,   though   the   other   Judge   changed \n\n\nmost of the time, as is evident from the subsequent order sheets.  Order \n\n\nsheet dated 30.5.2007 reveals that it was directed to put up the case for \n\n\nfurther hearing. Thus, it should have been heard by the Bench as it was \n\n\non 30.5.2007. \n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_131\">56.       In   the   counter   affidavit   filed   by   Davinder   Pal   Singh   Bhullar, \n\n\nrespondent no.1 before this Court, it has been stated as under:\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_132\">          &quot;W,X,   Y&amp;Z     That   in   reply   to   these   grounds,   it   is  \n\n          submitted   that   the   answering   respondent   being  \n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_113\">                                                                                      5</span>\n\n\f\nbehind the bars awaiting his death sentence moved  \n\nan   application   through   his   counsel   in   the   Hon&#x27;ble  \n\nHigh Court, when he came to know from the news  \n\nitem published in the news paper regarding marking  \n\nof CBI enquiry in the case of abduction of Balwant  \n\nSingh   Multani   an   Engineer,   son   of   Mr.   Darshan  \n\nSingh Multani a retired IAS Officer, who was then a  \n\nserving   officer.    When   the   answering   respondent  \n\nfound that Mr. Sumedh Singh Saini has now been  \n\ntaken   to   task   by   the   Hon&#x27;ble   Division   Bench   of  \n\nPunjab   and   Haryana   High   Court,   the   answering  \n\nrespondent also moved the Hon&#x27;ble High Court for  \n\nseeking   enquiry   regarding   the   abduction   and  \n\nmurder of his father and his maternal uncle who  \n\nwere   abducted   by   the   lawless   police   officials  \n\nheaded by Mr. Sumedh Singh Saini the then SSP  \n\nof   Chandigarh   and   the   Hon&#x27;ble   Bench   extended  \n\nthe   scope   of   the   enquiry   vide   order   dated  \n\n6.11.2007.    So  the  delay   is not  worthy   to  be  taken  \n\nnote of as the past record of the Mr. Sumedh Singh  \n\nSaini   which   has   been   mentioned   in   preliminary  \n\nsubmissions   clearly   shows   that   he   was   able   to  \n\nthreaten   and   overawe   an   Hon&#x27;ble   Punjab   and  \n\nHaryana High Court Judge in year 1995 and even  \n\nthough   he   has   been   charged   by   a   court   for  \n\nabduction   for   murder   of   three   individuals   in   year  \n\n1995, but the trial of the case is still pending in the  \n\nyear 2008.   So throughout this period the manner  \n\nin which Mr. Sumedh Singh Saini has been able to  \n\nsubvert   judicial   processes   did   not   allow   the  \n\nrespondent to move a court of law and now when  \n\nan Hon&#x27;ble Division Bench has shown courage to  \n\nuphold the majesty of law, that the respondent also  \n\ngathered   his   courage   to   move   the   Hon&#x27;ble   High  \n\nCourt, with the hope that at some time justice would  \n\nprevail.&quot;  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_133\">                                          (Emphasis added)\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_114\">                                                                     5</span>\n\n\f\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_134\">57.       So   far   as   the   issue   in   respect   of   the   proclaimed \n\n\ncomplainants/offenders is concerned, the document was before the High \n\n\nCourt   to   show   that   a   letter   had   been   sent   by   the   U.S   Department   of \n\n\nJustice   Federal   Wing   of   Investigation   to   the   CBI   disclosing   that \n\n\nManmohan Jit Singh had died on December 2006. Thus, information in \n\n\nrespect   of   one   of   the   proclaimed   offenders   was   with   the   court.   The \n\n\njudgment of the Trial Court was before the High Court under challenge. \n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_135\">Thus, the High Court could have taken note of the proclaimed offender \n\n\nand there was no new material that came before the High Court on the \n\n\nbasis   of   which   proceedings   could   be   revived.   The   chargesheet   in   the \n\n\nTrial Court itself revealed that two persons had died.  It appears that the \n\n\nState counsel also failed to bring these facts to the notice of the court.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_136\">58.       The   impugned   order   dated   5.10.2007   though   gives   an \n\n\nimpression  that  the High  Court was  trying to  procure  the presence   of \n\n\nthe proclaimed offenders but, in fact, it was to target the police officers,  \n\n\nwho had conducted the inquiry against Mr. Justice X.  The order reads \n\n\nthat   particular   persons   were   eliminated   in   a   false   encounter   by   the \n\n\npolice and it was to be ascertained as to who were the police officers \n\n\nresponsible for it, so that they could be brought to justice.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_115\">                                                                                        5</span>\n\n\f\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_137\">59.       There   could   be   no   justification   for   the   Bench   concerned   to \n\n\nentertain applications filed under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_139\">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. as miscellaneous \n\n\napplications in a disposed of appeal.   The law requires that the Bench \n\n\ncould   have   passed   an   appropriate   order   to   place   those   applications \n\n\nbefore   the   Bench   hearing   482   <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_140\">Cr.P.C</a>.   petitions   or   place   the   matters \n\n\nbefore the  Chief Justice for appropriate orders.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_138\">60.       As the High Court after rejecting the applications for leave to \n\n\nappeal   had   passed   several   orders   to   procure   the   presence   of   the \n\n\nproclaimed   offenders  so  that they  could be  brought to justice,   neither  \n\n\nthe State of Punjab nor Mr. S.S. Saini could be held to be the persons  \n\n\naggrieved by such orders and therefore, there could be no question of \n\n\nraising   any   protest   on   their   behalf   for   passing   such   orders   even   after \n\n\ndisposal of the application for leave to appeal as such orders were rather \n\n\nin their favour.   The appellants became aggrieved only and only when \n\n\nthe   High   Court   entertained   the   applications   filed   under   <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_141\">Section   482</a> \n\n\nCr.P.C.   for   tracing   out   the   whereabouts   of   certain   persons   allegedly \n\n\nmissing for the past  20 years. Such orders did not have any  connection \n\n\nwith the incident in respect of which the application for leave to appeal  \n\n\nhad been entertained and rejected.   An application for leave to appeal \n\n\nthat has been dismissed against an order of acquittal cannot provide a \n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_116\">                                                                                        5</span>\n\n\f\nplatform  for   an   investigation   in   a   subject   matter   that   is  alien   and   not \n\n\ndirectly concerned with the subject matter of appeal.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_139\">        Mr.   K.N.   Balgopal,   learned   Senior   counsel   appearing   for   the \n\n\nrespondents has submitted that the issue of bias must be agitated by a \n\n\nparty concerned at the earliest and it is not permissible to raise it at such \n\n\na belated stage.   The legal proposition in this regard is clear that if   a  \n\n\nperson has an opportunity to raise objections and fails to do so, it would \n\n\namount   to   waiver   on   his   part.     However,   such   person   can   raise \n\n\nobjections only if he is  impleaded as a party-respondent in the case and \n\n\nhas an opportunity to raise an objection on the ground of bias.   In the \n\n\ninstant case, neither the State of Punjab nor Mr. S.S. Saini have been \n\n\nimpleaded as respondents. Thus, the question of waiver on the ground \n\n\nof bias by either of them does not arise. \n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_140\">61.       Undoubtedly, in respect of such missing persons earlier habeas  \n\n\ncorpus  petitions had been filed by the persons concerned in 1991 and \n\n\n1997 which had been dealt with by the courts in accordance with law. \n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_141\">The writ petition for habeas corpus filed by Mrs. Jagir Kaur in respect \n\n\nof   Balwant   Singh   Bhullar   had   been   dismissed   in   1997   only   on   the \n\n\nground of delay.   We fail to understand how a fresh petition in respect \n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_117\">                                                                                         5</span>\n\n\f\nof   the   same   subject   matter   could   be   entertained   after   10   years   of \n\n\ndismissal of the said writ petition.  \n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_142\">62.           A second writ petition for issuing  a writ of  habeas corpus  is \n\n\nbarred by principles of  res judicata.   The doctrine of  res judicata  may \n\n\nnot apply in case a writ petition under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_142\">Article 32</a> of the Constitution is \n\n\nfiled  before  this Court  after  disposal  of a  habeas corpus  writ petition \n\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_143\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution by the High Court. However, it is \n\n\nnot possible to re-approach the High Court for the same relief by filing \n\n\na fresh writ petition for the reason that it would be difficult for the High \n\n\nCourt to set aside the order made by another Bench of the same court. \n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_143\">In case, a petition by issuing Writ of Habeas Corpus is dismissed by the \n\n\nHigh   Court   and   Special   Leave   Petition   against   the   same   is   also \n\n\ndismissed,  a petition under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_144\">Article 32</a> of the Constitution, seeking the \n\n\nsame relief would not be maintainable. \n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_144\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"924262\" id=\"span_118\">(See: <a href=\"/doc/924262/\" id=\"a_145\">Ghulam Sarwar v.

Thus, in view of the above, the law in the issue emerges that a \n\n\ncase   is   to   be   decided   on   its   facts   taking   into   consideration   whether \n\n\nreally new issues have been agitated or the facts raised  in subsequent \n\n\nwrit petition could not be known to the writ petitioner while filing the \n\n\nearlier writ petition.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_152\">          Be that as it may, the parties concerned had not filed fresh writ \n\n\npetitions,   rather   chosen,   for   reasons   best   known   to   them   applications \n\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_154\">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C., which could not have been entertained. \n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_153\">66.

Shri S.S. Saini had filed  \n\n\nreports against Mr. Justice X.  The Chief Justice of Punjab and Haryana \n\n\nHigh Court confronted Mr. Justice X with the said reports.

This Committee   even \n\n\nexamined  one Superintendent of Police of the intelligence wing   who \n\n\nhad worked directly under Shri S.S. Saini while conducting the enquiry. \n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_155\">67.       The   High   Court   has   adopted   an   unusual   and   unwarranted \n\n\nprocedure,   not   known   in   law,   while   issuing   certain   directions.     The \n\n\ncourt not  only  entertained  the applications  filed  by  Shri  Davinder Pal \n\n\nSingh Bhullar and Darshan Singh Multani in a disposed of appeal but \n\n\nenlarged the scope of CBI investigation from proclaimed offenders to \n\n\nother   missing   persons.     The   court   directed   the   CBI   to   treat   affidavits \n\n\nhanded over by the applicant Shri Bhullar who admittedly had inimical  \n\n\nrelation with Shri S.S. Saini, as statement of eye-witnesses. The court  \n\n\nfurther  directed  the  CBI   to  change   the  names   of witnesses  to  witness \n\n\n(A), (B) or (C) and record their statements under <a href=\"/doc/497457/\" id=\"a_155\">Section 164</a> Cr.P.C. so \n\n\nthat they could not resile at a later stage.  We fail to understand how the \n\n\ncourt could direct the CBI to adopt such an unwarranted course. \n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_156\">68.       The High Court accepted certain documents submitted by Shri \n\n\nR.S.

When the matter came  up for hearing on 2.4.2008, in spite of \n\n\nthe fact that the matter was heard throughout by a particular Division \n\n\nBench,     Mr.   Justice   X   alone   held   the   proceedings,   and   accepted   the \n\n\nstatus report of the CBI  sitting singly, as the proceedings reveal that the \n\n\nother Judge was not holding court on that day.   The order sheet dated \n\n\n2.4.2008 reads as under:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">            &quot;Status report, which has been presented by the CBI in \n\n            Court in a sealed cover, is taken in custody.\n\n\n            Hon&#x27;ble Mr. Justice Harbans Lal, who has to hear the \n\n            case   along   with   me,   as   it   is   a   part-heard   case,   is   not \n\n            holding court today.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">\n            To come up on 4.4.2008.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">                                                                      Sd/-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">                                                                      Judge&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_158\">70.       The   FIR   unquestionably   is   an   inseparable   corollary   to   the \n\n\nimpugned orders which are a nullity.   Therefore, the very birth of the \n\n\nFIR, which is a direct consequence of the impugned orders cannot have \n\n\nany lawful existence.

The order impugned has rightly been challenged to be a nullity \n\n\nat least on three grounds, namely, judicial bias; want of jurisdiction by \n\n\nvirtue of application of the provisions of Section 362 Cr.P.C. coupled \n\n\nwith the principles of constructive  res judicata; and the Bench had not \n\n\nbeen assigned the roster to entertain petitions under Section 482 Cr.P.C. \n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_160\">The entire judicial process appears to have been drowned to achieve a \n\n\nmotivated result which we are unable to approve of. \n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_161\">72.       It   is   a   settled   legal   proposition   that   if   initial   action   is   not   in \n\n\nconsonance   with   law,   all   subsequent   and   consequential   proceedings \n\n\nwould fall through for the reason that illegality strikes at the root of the \n\n\norder.

The error in the impugned orders of the High Court transgresses \n\n\njudicious   discretion.
