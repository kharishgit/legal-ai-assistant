The  Court  formulated  the\nfollowing two questions for consideration:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">(i)  Can cognizance of an  offence  punishable  under  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_1\">Section  138</a>  of  the\nNegotiable Instruments Act 1881 be taken on the basis of a  complaint  filed\nbefore the expiry of  the  period  of  15  days  stipulated  in  the  notice\nrequired to be served upon the drawer of the cheque in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_2\">Section  138</a>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">(c)   of   the Act aforementioned? And,\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">(ii)  If answer to question No.1 is in the  negative,  can  the  complainant\nbe       permitted      to     present     the      complaint          again\nnotwithstanding the fact that the  period  of  one  month  stipulated  under\n<a href=\"/doc/595945/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 142 (b)</a> for the filing of such a complaint has expired?\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_3\">2.          The two-Judge Bench  in  that  order  noticed  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_4\">Section  138</a>  and\n<a href=\"/doc/595945/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 142</a> of the Negotiable Instruments Act,  1881  (“<a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_6\">NI  Act</a>”)  and  also\nreferred to the two decisions  of  this  Court,  namely,  (1)  Narsingh  Das\nTapadia[1] and (2) Sarav Investment &amp; Financial Consultancy[2].   The  Bench\nalso noticed the judgments of  High  Courts  of  Calcutta,  Orissa,  Bombay,\nPunjab and Haryana, Andhra Pradesh, Allahabad,  Gauhati,  Rajasthan,  Delhi,\nMadhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Madras, Jammu and  Kashmir  and  Karnataka\nand observed that judicial opinion on the first question  was   split  among\nthe High Courts in the country and so also the two decisions of  this  Court\nin Narsingh Das Tapadia1 and  Sarav  Investment  &amp;  Financial  Consultancy2.\nEven amongst the two High Courts, namely, Jammu and Kashmir  and  Karnataka,\nthe Bench noticed  that  the  decisions  on  the  first  question  were  not\nuniform.  It was felt by the  two-Judge  Bench  that  the  conflict  in  the\njudicial  pronouncements  needed  to  be   resolved   authoritatively   and,\naccordingly, referred the above two questions for consideration by a  three-\nJudge Bench of this Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">3.    This is how the matter has been placed before us.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">4.    It is not necessary to narrate the facts in  detail.   Suffice  it  to\nrefer to factual matrix noted in the referral order which is as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">The appellant  filed  a  complaint  under  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_7\">Section  138</a>  of  the  Negotiable\nInstruments Act against respondent No.1 Smt. Savitri Pandey in the Court  of\nAdditional Civil Judge (J.D.)/Magistrate, Sonbhadra in the  State  of  Uttar\nPradesh.      The respondent&#x27;s case was that  four  cheques  issued  by  the\naccused-respondent in  his  favour  were  dishonoured,  when  presented  for\nencashment. A notice calling upon the respondent-drawer  of  the  cheque  to\npay the amount covered by the cheques was issued and duly  served  upon  the\nrespondent as required under <a href=\"/doc/1440901/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 138 (c)</a> of The  Negotiable  Instruments\nAct, 1881. No payment was, however, made by the accused  till  7th  October,\n2008 when a complaint under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 138</a> of the Act aforementioned was  filed\nbefore the Magistrate. Significantly enough the notice  in  question  having\nbeen served  on  23rd  September,  2008,  the  complaint  presented  on  7th\nOctober, 2008 was filed before expiry of the stipulated period of  15  days.\nThe Magistrate all the same took cognizance of the offence on 14th  October,\n2008 and issued summons to the accused, who then assailed the said order  in\na petition under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 482</a>  of  the  Cr.P.C.  before  the  High  Court  of\nJudicature at Allahabad. The  High  Court  took  the  view  that  since  the\ncomplaint had been filed within 15 days of the service  of  the  notice  the\nsame was clearly premature and the order passed  by  the  Magistrate  taking\ncognizance of the offence on the basis of such a complaint is  legally  bad.\nThe High Court accordingly quashed the complaint and the entire  proceedings\nrelating thereto in terms of its order impugned in the present appeal.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_6\">5.          Before we advert to the two decisions of this Court in  Narsingh\nDas  Tapadia1  and  Sarav  Investment  &amp;  Financial  Consultancy2,  and  few\ndecisions of the High Courts, we think it proper to refer  to  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_11\">Sections  138</a>\nand <a href=\"/doc/595945/\" id=\"a_12\">142</a> of the NI Act.  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act, as it stands today  after\namendment by Act 55 of 2002, defines the ingredients of the offence and  the\npunishment that would follow in the event of such  an  offence  having  been\ncommitted   and    the    proviso    appended    thereto    makes    certain\neventualities/conditions precedent for the commission of offence.  It  reads\nas under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">138.

The  said\nprovision, after amendment by Act 55 of 2002, is as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">142. Cognizance of offences.-Notwithstanding anything contained in the  <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_15\">Code\nof      Criminal      Procedure</a>,      1973      (2      of      1974)      -\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">                       (a) no court shall take  cognizance  of  any  offence\npunishable under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_16\">section 138</a> except upon a complaint, in  writing,  made  by\nthe payee or, as the case may be, the holder in due course  of  the  cheque;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">                 (b) such complaint is made within one month of the date  on\nwhich the cause of action arises under clause (c) of the proviso to  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_17\">section\n138</a>:                               Provided  that  the   cognizance   of   a\ncomplaint may be taken by the Court after  the  prescribed  period,  if  the\ncomplainant satisfies the Court that he had sufficient cause for not  making\na complaint within such period.                    (c) no court inferior  to\nthat of a Metropolitan Magistrate or a  Judicial  Magistrate  of  the  first\nclass shall try any offence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_18\">section 138</a>.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_10\">7.          It may not be out of place to mention here that  entire  <a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_19\">Chapter\nXVII of the NI Act</a> was brought in the statute  by  Act  66  of  1988  w.e.f.\n01.04.1989.  This Chapter comprises of <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_20\">Sections 138</a> to <a href=\"/doc/177946336/\" id=\"a_21\">147</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_11\">8.          The other two provisions  which  deserve  mention  are  <a href=\"/doc/255245/\" id=\"a_22\">Sections\n2(d)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/686759/\" id=\"a_23\">190</a> of the Code of  Criminal  Procedure,  1973  (“Code”).   <a href=\"/doc/328668/\" id=\"a_24\">Section\n2(d)</a> defines complaint in the context of the Code as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">2(d)&quot;complaint&quot; means  any  allegation  made  orally  or  in  writing  to  a\nMagistrate, with a view to his taking action  under  this  Code,  that  some\nperson, whether known or unknown, has committed an  offence,  but  does  not\ninclude a police report.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_12\">9.          Chapter XIV of the Code bears the  title  ‘Conditions  Requisite\nfor Initiation  of  Proceedings’.   This  chapter  has  only  one  provision\nnamely,  Section  190.   Section  190  makes  provision  for  cognizance  of\noffences by Magistrates.  It reads as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">190. Cognizance of offences by Magistrates. – (1) Subject to the  provisions\nof this Chapter, any Magistrate of the first class, and  any  Magistrate  of\nthe second class specially empowered in this behalf under  sub-section  (2),\nmay take cognizance of any offence—\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">       (a)    upon  receiving  a  complaint  of   facts   which   constitute\nsuch offence;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_13\">      (b)   upon a police report of such facts;\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_14\">       (c)    upon    information   received   from   any    person    other\nthan a police officer, or upon his  own  knowledge,  that               such\noffence has been committed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_15\">      (2)   The Chief Judicial Magistrate may empower any Magistrate of  the\nsecond class to take cognizance under sub-section (1) of  such  offences  as\nare within his competence to inquire into or try.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_16\">10.         Before the decision of this Court in Narsingh Das Tapadia1,  six\nHigh Courts had occasion to consider  the  question  whether  the  complaint\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act was maintainable when the stipulated  period\nof 15 days of the receipt of the notice as provided in  clause  (c)  of  the\nproviso appended to  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_26\">Section  138</a>  had  not  expired.   The  first  of  such\ndecisions, decided as early as on 29.07.1992 is of the Bombay High Court  in\nRakesh Nemkumar Porwal[3]. The Division Bench of the Bombay High Court  held\nthat as the complaint was presented within the period  of  15  days  of  the\nservice  of  notice  effected  on  the  accused,  the  complaint   was   not\nmaintainable for commission of offence under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 138</a> of the  NI  Act  as\nno offence can be said to have been committed on the  date  of  lodgment  of\nthe complaint.  Reading <a href=\"/doc/1440901/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 138(c)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/595945/\" id=\"a_29\">Section  142  (b)</a>  together,  the\nDivision Bench of the Bombay High Court held that no offence can be said  to\nhave been committed until and unless the period of  15  days  as  prescribed\nunder clause 138(c) has in fact elapsed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">11.         The above view taken by the Division Bench of  the  Bombay  High\nCourt is echoed by the High Courts of Punjab and Haryana  (Ashok  Verma)[4],\nAndhra Pradesh (N. Venkata Sivaram Prasad)[5], Karnataka  (Ashok  Hegde)[6],\nOrissa (Sri Niranjan Sahoo)[7] and Jammu and Kashmir (M/s  Harpreet  Hosiery\nRehari)[8].\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">12.         In the case of Ashok Verma4,  the  argument  of  the  petitioner\naccused before the Punjab and Haryana High Court was  that  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_30\">Section  138</a>  of\nthe NI Act envisaged a clear 15 days notice to the drawer of the cheque  and\nthe time was to be computed from the date of the receipt of the notice,  but\nthe impugned complaint had been filed before the expiry of 15 days  and  the\ncomplaint was liable to  be  quashed  on  this  ground.   Dealing  with  the\nargument, the Punjab and Haryana High Court referred to the decision of  the\nBombay High Court in Rakesh  Nemkumar  Porwal3  and  on  going  through  the\nprovisions of <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 138</a> held as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">A perusal of the above section shows that  while  the  section  defines  the\nnecessary ingredients of the offence and punishment that can be awarded  for\nthe commission of the offence, the proviso to  the  section  lays  down  the\nconditions precedent for the commission of the offence.  According  to  this\nproviso the necessary ingredients of the offence are  that  the  cheque  was\npresented to the bank within a period of six months from the date  on  which\nit was drawn or the period of its validity,  that  the  cheque  is  returned\nunpaid because of insufficiency of funds or that the amount  of  the  cheque\nexceeded the amount arranged to be paid from the bank and the payee  gave  a\nnotice to the drawer claiming the amount within 15 days of  the  receipt  of\nthe information from the bank regarding the return of  the  cheque  and  the\ndrawer failed to make payment within 15 days of the receipt of  the  notice.\nUnder Sub-clause (c) of the proviso a 15 days time is granted to the  drawer\nof the cheque to make payment and unless this period elapsed and no  payment\nwas made, the drawer was not liable for  any  offence  under  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 138</a> of\nthe Act.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_19\">13.         The Division Bench of  the  Andhra  Pradesh  High  Court  in  N.\nVenkata Sivaram Prasad5 was confronted with the question as to  whether  the\nMagistrate can take cognizance of the complaint  given  in  the  case  under\nconsideration and proceed with the trial of the complaint after  the  expiry\nof 15 days as prescribed under <a href=\"/doc/1440901/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 138(c)</a> of the NI Act.   The  question\nthat fell for consideration before the Andhra Pradesh  High  Court  involved\nthe aspect whether the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 138</a> can be said to be  complete\nonly if the drawer fails to pay the amount within 15 days of the receipt  of\nthe notice as contemplated in proviso (c)  to  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_35\">Section  138</a>.   The  Division\nBench took into consideration the provisions contained in  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_36\">Section  138</a>  and\n<a href=\"/doc/595945/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 142</a> of the NI Act  and  so  also  <a href=\"/doc/328668/\" id=\"a_38\">Section  2(d)</a>,  <a href=\"/doc/328668/\" id=\"a_39\">Section  2(n)</a>  and\nSection 190 of the Code and held that until and  unless  the  criteria  laid\ndown in <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 138</a> are complied with, it would not constitute  an  offence.\nThe Division Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court held:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">Proviso (c) clearly stipulates that the Section does not  apply  unless  the\ndrawer of the cheques fails to make the payment to the payee within 15  days\nof the receipt of the said notice. Thus, the payee has  been  given  liberty\nto make the payment within 15 days of the receipt of the notice even  though\nthe cheque was returned by the Bank unpaid. Hence, the  reading  of  Proviso\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">(c) to <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 138</a> clearly denotes that it would not be an  offence  if  the\ndrawer pays the amount within a period of 15 days as  a  specified  therein.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_20\">In such circumstances, there could not have been any complaint alleging  the\nviolation of <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 138</a>.  The  pre-offence  period  granted  to  the  payee\nshould   be   construed   strictly,   otherwise   the   very   purpose    of\n<a href=\"/doc/1440901/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 138(c)</a> of the Negotiable Instruments Act would  be  frustrated.  The\ncomplainant  should  be  able  to   point   out   to   the   offence   under\n<a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 138</a> when the complaint was filed. When the complaint is  filed  even\nbefore the offence is completed, it cannot be said that the offence is  made\nout and, therefore, such complaint is invalid in the eye of law. As  already\nnoticed, under <a href=\"/doc/595945/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 142</a> of the Act, no Court  shall  take  cognizance  of\nany offence  punishable  under  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 138</a>,  except  upon  a  complaint  in\nwriting made by the payee. Therefore, the necessary ingredient enabling  the\nMagistrate to take cognizance of the offence  is  that  there  should  be  a\ncomplaint in writing by the payee and the said complaint should disclose  an\noffence under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 138</a>. In the complaint made by  the  respondent  before\nthe Magistrate, no offence could have been disclosed as the time  prescribed\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_48\">Section 138</a>, Proviso (c) was not exhausted by the time  the  complaint\nwas presented to the Magistrate. Even by the date  of  service  of  summons,\nthere was no further complaint in writing to the effect that even after  the\nexpiry of 15 days period as mentioned in proviso (c), the drawer  failed  to\npay the amount.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">14.         The Andhra Pradesh High Court  in  N.  Venkata  Sivaram  Prasad5\nalso considered the question in light of Section 190 of the  Code  and  held\nas under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">The matter may also be viewed from the provisions of  <a href=\"/doc/686759/\" id=\"a_49\">Section 190</a>,  Cr.P.C.,\nwhere the Magistrate is empowered to take cognizance  of  any  offence  upon\nreceiving a complaint of facts which constitute such  an  offence.  We  have\nalready referred to the definition of the &#x27;complaint&#x27; in <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_50\">Cr.P.C</a>.  Therefore,\nfor taking cognizance of the offence, there should  have  been  a  complaint\ncontaining the facts which constitute an offence. Unless the offence  is  ex\nfacie disclosed in the complaint, the Magistrate cannot have any  competence\nto take cognizance of the offence and proceed further. In the present  case,\non the facts stated in the complaint, there could not  be  any  offence.  As\nthe complaint on the  basis  of  which  the  Magistrate  proceeded  to  take\ncognizance is not a complaint at all in the eye  of  law,  the  question  of\nproceeding with the case on the basis of such complaint does not  arise.  In\nthe instant case, the  Magistrate  had  no  means  of  knowing  whether  the\noffence was completed subsequent to the date of the  complaint  because,  as\nalready stated, there was  no  further  written  complaint  as  required  by\n<a href=\"/doc/595945/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 142(a)</a>. The subsequent events on completion of the offence can  only\ncome to the knowledge of the Court by way of  complaint  in  writing.  Apart\nfrom the original complaint which does not disclose any  offence,  there  is\nno further complaint. As rightly  pointed  out  by  the  learned  Additional\nPublic Prosecutor, when the special law specifies not only  the  ingredients\nof the offence but also the procedure, the requirements have to be  strictly\ncomplied with. Hence, we are of the opinion that the  Court  cannot  proceed\nwith  the  case  even  after  the   lapse   of   time   as   prescribed   by\nSection 138(c) of Negotiate Instruments Act.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">It was, thus, held by the Andhra Pradesh  High  Court  that  the  Magistrate\nshould not have acted upon a premature complaint which was not  a  complaint\nat all in the eye of law.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_22\">15.         In Ashok Hegde6, the single Judge of the  Karnataka  High  Court\nwhile dealing with the contention raised by the petitioner therein that  the\ncomplainant has not given 15 days’ time to the  petitioner  as  contemplated\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1240817/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 138(b)</a> of the NI Act  and  the  complaint  was  premature  and\nshould not have been entertained, the  single  Judge  held,  “…..  from  the\nabove, it is clear that he received the notice  back  on  21.09.1989.   Even\naccepting  that  the  petitioner  refused  the  notice  on  20.09.1989,  the\nrespondent ought to have filed this complaint after the expiry  of  15  days\nfrom the date of receipt of the notice.  The  date  of  issuance  of  notice\ncannot be taken into account……..  Therefore, the cause  of  action  had  not\narisen to file the complaint against the petitioner and  the  complaint  was\npremature…….”\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_23\">16.         The Orissa High Court in Sri Niranjan Sahoo7 also took the  view\nthat if the complaint case is filed before expiry of 15 days as provided  in\nclause (c) to the proviso of <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_53\">Section 138</a>, then  cognizance  of  the  offence\ncannot be taken in view of the provision in clause (b) of  <a href=\"/doc/595945/\" id=\"a_54\">Section  142</a>  and\nconsequentially the complaint was liable to be quashed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_24\">17.         The view of Jammu  and  Kashmir  High  Court  in  M/s.  Harpreet\nHosiery Rehari8  is to the effect that under the law drawer has got 15  days\nto make the payment from the receipt of notice of dishonour of  the  cheque.\nIt is only thereafter that an action under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act can  be\ninitiated against the defaulting party.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">18.         It was after the above decisions  of  the  various  High  Courts\nthat the decision of this Court in Narsingh Das Tapadia1 came.  In  Narsingh\nDas Tapadia1, which was decided on 06.09.2000, the two-Judge Bench  of  this\nCourt noted the facts as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">…… that the respondent borrowed a sum of Rs.2,30,000 from the appellant  and\nissued a post-dated cheque in his favour. When the cheque was presented  for\ndemand on      3-10-1994, the same was dishonoured by the bank on  6-10-1994\ndue to “insufficient funds”. The appellant demanded  the  accused  to  repay\nthe amount vide his  telegrams  sent  on      7-10-1994  and  17-10-1994.  A\nnotice was also issued to the respondent on 19-10-1994  demanding  to  repay\nthe amount. Despite receipt of  the  notice  on  26-10-1994  the  respondent\nneither paid the  amount  nor  gave  any  reply.  To  prove  his  case,  the\nappellant-complainant  examined  three  witnesses  and   proved   documents,\nExhibits P-1 to P-6. In his statement under <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_56\">Section 313</a> CrPC the  respondent\ndenied the  allegations  but  refused  to  lead  any  defence  evidence.  On\nanalysis of the evidence and after hearing the counsel for the parties,  the\ntrial court concluded as under:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">“The complainant established that the accused borrowed Rs.2,30,000 from  him\nand the accused issued Ext. P-3, cheque and the cheque was returned  due  to\ninsufficiency of funds and the accused did not repay the amount in spite  of\nreceipt of notice from the complainant and hence the accused is  liable  for\npunishment under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_57\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act.”\n\nAs noticed earlier, the appeal filed by the respondent was dismissed on  19-\n4-1997.  The  High  Court  found  that  as   the   notice   intimating   the\ndishonourment of cheque was served  upon  the  accused  on  26-10-1994,  the\nappellant-complainant could not file the complaint unless the expiry  of  15\ndays’ period. It was found on facts that the complaint  filed  on  8-11-1994\nwas returned after finding some defect in it.  However,  when  refiled,  the\nCourt took the cognizance on  17-11-1994.  The  High  Court  held  that  the\noriginal complaint having been filed on 8-11-1994 was premature  and  liable\nto be dismissed.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">19.         This Court in Narsingh Das Tapadia1  considered  the  provisions\ncontained in clause (c) of the proviso to <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_58\">Section 138</a>  and  <a href=\"/doc/595945/\" id=\"a_59\">Section  142</a>  of\nthe NI Act and also considered  the  expression  “taking  cognizance  of  an\noffence” and held that mere presentation  of  the  complaint  on  08.11.1994\nwhen  it  was   returned   to   the  complainant  on  the  ground  that  the\nverification was not signed by the counsel, could not be  termed  to  be  an\naction of the Magistrate taking cognizance within  the  meaning  of  <a href=\"/doc/595945/\" id=\"a_60\">Section\n142</a> of the NI Act.  The two-Judge Bench did not  approve  the  view  of  the\nHigh Court and held that the High Court erroneously held  the  complaint  as\npremature.  Consequently, the judgment of the High Court was set  aside  and\nthe conviction of the respondent  under  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_61\">Section  138</a>  of  the  NI  Act  was\nupheld.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\">20.         After the decision of this Court in Narsingh Das  Tapadia1,  the\nKarnataka High Court in Arun Hegde[9] did not accept the contention  of  the\naccused that the complaint filed under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_62\">Section 138</a> on 15th  day  of  service\nof notice of demand was premature and as  such  not  maintainable.   Relying\nupon Narsingh Das Tapadia1, the single Judge of the Karnataka High Court  in\nArun Hegde9 held that if the complaint was found to  be  premature,  it  can\nawait maturity or be returned to the complainant for filing  later  and  its\nmere presentation at  an  earlier  date  need  not  necessarily  render  the\ncomplaint liable to be dismissed or confer any right  upon  the  accused  to\nabsolve himself from the criminal liability for the offence committed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">21.         In Hem Lata Gupta[10],  the Allahabad High Court  while  dealing\nwith the complaint filed before expiry of 15 days, after  relying  upon  the\ndecision of this Court in Narsingh Das Tapadia1 held that the bar of  expiry\nof 15 days from the date of service of notice is for taking  cognizance  and\nnot for filing complaint.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">22.         In Mahendra Agarwal[11], the Rajasthan High  Court  adopted  the\nreasoning that was made by this Court in  Narsingh  Das  Tapadia1  and  held\nthat mere presentation of the complaint in  the  court  cannot  be  held  to\nmean, that its  cognizance  had  been  taken  by  the  Magistrate.   If  the\ncomplaint is found to be premature, it can await maturity or be returned  to\nthe complainant for filing later and its mere  presentation  at  an  earlier\ndate need not necessarily render the complaint liable  to  be  dismissed  or\nconfer any right upon the accused  to  absolve  himself  from  the  criminal\nliability for the offence committed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\">23.          In  Bapulal  B.  Kacchi[12],  the  Madhya  Pradesh  High  Court\nconsidered the matter  against  the  order  passed  by  the  Sessions  Judge\nsetting aside the order passed by the Chief  Judicial  Magistrate,  Shajapur\nwhereby he refused to register the complaint under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_63\">Section  138</a>  of  the  NI\nAct against the accused as it was found to be premature since 15  days  from\nthe date of receipt of the notice by  the  accused  had  not  elapsed.   The\nSessions Judge set aside the order of the Chief Judicial Magistrate  dealing\nwith criminal revision filed by  the  accused.  Madhya  Pradesh  High  Court\nfollowed the decision of this Court in Narsingh Das Tapadia1 and  held  that\nthe order of the Chief Judicial Magistrate in dismissing the  complaint  was\nwrong and that order was rightly set aside by the revisional court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\">24.         The Gauhati High Court in Yunus Khan[13] relying  upon  Narsingh\nDas Tapadia1  took the view that mere presentation of  a  complaint  in  the\nCourt of Judicial  Magistrate  does  not  mean  that  Magistrate  has  taken\ncognizance of the same.   Though the complaint was filed under  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_64\">Section  138</a>\nof the NI Act in the Court of Judicial Magistrate  when  only  13  days  had\nelapsed from the date of receipt of the notice and the requisite  period  of\n15 days was not yet completed but when the Magistrate  took  cognizance,  15\ndays had elapsed from the date of the receipt of the  notice  and  thus  the\ncomplaint already stood validly  instituted  and  the  prosecution  launched\nagainst the accused on the basis of such a complaint could not be  held  bad\nin law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\">25.         A single Judge of Delhi High Court in Zenith Fashion  Makers[14]\n  was concerned with the case arising from the following facts:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">The complaint under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_65\">Section 138</a> of Negotiable Instrument Act  was  filed  by\nthe respondent for dishonour of two cheques No. 615385  dated  20.7.2003  of\nRs. 8,00,000/- and No.615387 dated  20.9.2003  of  Rs.3,00,000/-.  Both  the\ncheques were dishonoured on account of insufficiency of  funds.  The  return\nmemo of the bank is dated 20.9.2003. The legal notice  under  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_66\">Section 138</a> of\nNegotiable Instruments Act was issued on 15.10.2003 through  Regd.  Post  as\nwell as through speed post. The postal acknowledgment card shows service  on\n18.10.2003. The complainant pleaded that the notices were duly received  but\nno payment in respect of the dishonoured cheques was made within 15 days  of\nthe notice as was required by  the  law  as  well  as  by  the  notice.  The\ncomplaint is presented on 31.10.2003.  The  Magistrate  took  cognizance  on\n31.10.2003 itself and directed issue of process on the  same  day.  What  is\ncontended in this petition under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_67\">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. is that the  notice  of\ndemand being  of  15.10.2003,  dispatched  on  17.10.2003  and  received  on\n18.10.2003, the complaint was filed within 15 days after service  of  notice\nand hence was pre-mature as the cause of action could accrue only  after  15\ndays of the notice, i.e., on 3.11.2003.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_33\">Despite the fact that the complaint was presented before the  expiry  of  15\ndays of service of notice and the Magistrate  took  cognizance  also  before\nthe expiry of 15 days, the  High  Court  strangely  held  that  a  premature\ncomplaint under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_68\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act cannot be quashed  on  the  ground\nof pre-maturity since there was no plea on the side of the accused  that  he\nwould have paid the cheque amount had the complainant given it the  required\ntime.  The Delhi High Court while doing so relied upon the decision of  this\nCourt in Narsingh Das Tapadia1 and also  invoked  the  maxim  ‘Actus  curiae\nneminem gravabit’, an act of the Court shall prejudice no man.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_34\">26.         The Allahabad High Court in Ganga Ram Singh[15]  took  the  view\nthat if the complaint was filed under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_69\">Section  138</a>  of  the  NI  Act  before\nexpiry of 15 days of statutory  notice,  the  concerned  court  should  have\nwaited and allowed the complainant  to  establish  its  case  or  cognizance\nshould have been taken after the expiry of the stipulated period instead  of\ndismissing the complaint outright as premature.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_35\">27.            A single Judge of the Madras High Court,  following  Narsingh\nDas Tapadia1 held that though the complaint was preferred three  days  short\nof the time to be availed by the accused to settle the dues  but  since  the\nMagistrate  had  taken  cognizance  of  the  complaint  presented   by   the\ncomplainant after the 15 days time granted under  the  statutory  notice  to\nsettle the amount due to complainant, the complaint  cannot  be  quashed  on\nthe ground that it was filed prematurely.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\">28.         In S. Janak Singh[16], the Jammu and Kashmir High  Court    took\nthe view with regard to presentation of  complaint  before  the  accrual  of\ncause of action that though the complaint under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_70\">Section 138</a> of  the  NI  Act\nhaving been filed before the accrual of cause of action, the same could  not\nbe legally entertained by  the  trial  court.   Relying  upon  Narsingh  Das\nTapadia1, it was held that if the complaint was found to  be  premature,  it\ncan await maturity or be returned to the complainant for  filing  later  and\nits mere presentation at an earlier date need  not  necessarily  render  the\ncomplaint liable to be  dismissed  or  confer  any  right  upon  accused  to\nabsolve himself from the criminal liability for the offence committed.   The\nview of the single Judge of the Jammu and Kashmir High Court is  founded  on\nthe decision of this Court in Narsingh Das Tapadia1.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">29.         For about 7 years since the decision was given by this Court  in\nNarsingh  Das  Tapadia1,  the  various  High  Courts,  as  indicated  above,\ncontinued to take the view that presentation of a  complaint  under  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_71\">Section\n138</a> of the NI Act before the accrual of the cause of action does not  render\nit not maintainable if cognizance had been taken  by  the  Magistrate  after\nexpiry of 15 days of the period of notice.  In such matters,  no  illegality\nor impropriety found to have been committed  by  the  Magistrate  in  taking\ncognizance upon such complaint.   This  legal  position,  however,  was  not\naccepted by a two-Judge Bench decision of this Court in Sarav  Investment  &amp;\nFinancial Consultancy2.  Dealing with the provision  under  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_72\">Section  138</a>  of\nthe NI Act, this Court held that <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_73\">Section 138</a> contained  a  penal  provision;\nit was a special  statute.   Having  regard  to  the  purport  of  the  said\nprovision as also in view  of  the  fact  that  it  provides  for  a  severe\npenalty,  the  provision  warrant  a  strict   construction.    This   Court\nemphasized that clause (c) of the proviso to <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_74\">Section 138</a> provides  that  the\nholder of the cheque must be given an opportunity to pay the  amount  within\n15 days of the receipt of the notice.  Complaint, thus,  can  be  filed  for\ncommission of an offence by drawee of the cheque only 15 days after  service\nof the notice.  In Sarav Investment &amp; Financial  Consultancy2,  this  Court,\nthus, held that service of notice in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_75\">Section  138</a>  proviso  (b)  of\nthe <a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_76\">NI Act</a> was a part of cause of  action  for  lodging  the  complaint  and\ncommunication to the accused about the fact of dishonouring of  the  cheques\nand calling upon him to pay the amount within  15  days  was  imperative  in\ncharacter.  It is true that in Sarav Investment  &amp;  Financial  Consultancy2,\nthere is no reference  of  the  decision  of  this  Court  in  Narsingh  Das\nTapadia1.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">30.         Sarav Investment &amp; Financial Consultancy2     led  to  the  view\nbeing taken by the High Courts that a complaint under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_77\">Section 138</a> of the  NI\nAct filed before expiry of 15 days of service of notice  was  premature  and\nsuch complaint could not be treated as complaint  in  the  eye  of  law  and\ncriminal proceedings initiated are liable to be quashed.  This is seen  from\nthe view of the Calcutta High Court in Sandip Guha[17] and the  judgment  of\nthe Himachal Pradesh High Court in Rattan Chand[18].\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_39\">31.         <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_78\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act comprises of the main provision  which\ndefines the ingredients of the offence and the punishment that would  follow\nin the event of such an offence having  been  committed.  Appended  to  this\nSection is also a proviso which has three clauses, viz., (a), (b)  and  (c).\nThe offence under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_79\">Section 138</a> is made effective only on fulfillment  of  the\neventualities contained in clauses (a), (b) and  (c)  of  the  proviso.  For\ncompletion of an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_80\">Section 138</a>  of  the  NI  Act  not  only  the\nsatisfaction of the ingredients of offence set out in the main part  of  the\nprovision is necessary  but  it  is  also  imperative  that  all  the  three\neventualities mentioned in clauses (a), (b)  and  (c)  of  the  proviso  are\nsatisfied. Mere issuance  of  a  cheque  and  dishonour  thereof  would  not\nconstitute an offence by itself under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_81\">Section 138</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\">32.         <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_82\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act has been analysed  by  this  Court  in\nKusum Ingots &amp; Alloys Ltd.[19] wherein this Court said  that  the  following\ningredients are required to  be  satisfied  for  making  out  a  case  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_83\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">(i) a person must have drawn a cheque on an account maintained by him  in  a\nbank for payment of a certain amount of money to another person from out  of\nthat account for the discharge of any debt or other liability;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">(ii) that cheque has been presented to the  bank  within  a  period  of  six\nmonths from the date on which it is  drawn  or  within  the  period  of  its\nvalidity, whichever is earlier;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">(iii) that cheque is returned by the bank unpaid, either because the  amount\nof money standing to the credit of the account  is  insufficient  to  honour\nthe cheque or that it exceeds the amount  arranged  to  be  paid  from  that\naccount by an agreement made with the bank;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">(iv) the payee or the holder in due course of the cheque makes a demand  for\nthe payment of the said amount of money by giving a notice  in  writing,  to\nthe drawer of the cheque, within 15 days of the receipt  of  information  by\nhim from the bank regarding the return of the cheque as unpaid;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">(v) the drawer of such cheque fails to make payment of the  said  amount  of\nmoney to the payee or the holder in due course of the cheque within 15  days\nof the receipt of the said notice.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_41\">33.         We are in agreement with the above analysis.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\">34.         In K.R. Indira[20], a two-Judge Bench  of  this  Court  observed\nthat the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_84\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act could be completed  if  all\nthe above components are satisfied.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_43\">35.         Insofar as  the  present  reference  is  concerned,  the  debate\nbroadly centers around clause (c) of the proviso to <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_85\">Section 138</a>  of  the  NI\nAct. The requirement of clause (c) of the proviso is that the drawer of  the\ncheque must have failed to make the payment of  the  cheque  amount  to  the\npayee within 15 days of the  receipt  of  the  notice.  Clause  (c)  of  the\nproviso offers a total period of 15 days to the  drawer  from  the  date  of\nreceipt of  the  notice  to  make  payment  of  the  cheque  amount  on  its\ndishonour.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_44\">36.         Can an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_86\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act be said  to  have\nbeen committed when the period provided in clause (c)  of  the  proviso  has\nnot expired? <a href=\"/doc/328668/\" id=\"a_87\">Section 2(d)</a> of the Code  defines  ‘complaint’.   According  to\nthis definition, complaint means any allegation made orally  or  in  writing\nto a Magistrate with a view to taking his action against a  person  who  has\ncommitted an offence. Commission of an offence is a sine qua non for  filing\na complaint and for taking cognizance of such offence.  A  bare  reading  of\nthe provision contained in clause (c) of the proviso makes it clear that  no\ncomplaint can be filed for an offence  under  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_88\">Section  138</a>  of  the  NI  Act\nunless the period of 15 days has elapsed. Any complaint  before  the  expiry\nof 15 days from the date  on  which  the  notice  has  been  served  on  the\ndrawer/accused is no complaint at all in the eye of  law.   It  is  not  the\nquestion of prematurity of the  complaint where it is  filed  before  expiry\nof 15 days from the date on which notice has been served on him,  it  is  no\ncomplaint at all under law. As a matter of fact, <a href=\"/doc/595945/\" id=\"a_89\">Section 142</a> of the NI  Act,\ninter alia, creates a legal bar on the Court from taking  cognizance  of  an\noffence  under  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_90\">Section  138</a>  except  upon  a  written  complaint.  Since  a\ncomplaint filed under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_91\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act  before  the  expiry  of  15\ndays  from  the  date  on  which  the  notice  has  been   served   on   the\ndrawer/accused is no complaint in the eye of law, obviously,  no  cognizance\nof an offence can be taken on the basis of such  complaint.  Merely  because\nat the time of taking cognizance by the Court, the period  of  15  days  has\nexpired  from  the  date  on  which  notice   has   been   served   on   the\ndrawer/accused, the Court is not  clothed  with  the  jurisdiction  to  take\ncognizance of an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_92\">Section 138</a> on a complaint filed  before  the\nexpiry of 15 days from the date of receipt of notice by the  drawer  of  the\ncheque.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_45\">37.          A complaint filed before expiry of 15 days  from  the  date  on\nwhich notice has been served on drawer/accused cannot be  said  to  disclose\nthe cause of action in terms of clause (c) of the  proviso  to  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_93\">Section  138</a>\nand upon such complaint which does not disclose  the  cause  of  action  the\nCourt is not competent to take cognizance.  A conjoint  reading  of  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_94\">Section\n138</a>, which defines as to when and under what circumstances  an  offence  can\nbe said to have been committed, with <a href=\"/doc/595945/\" id=\"a_95\">Section 142(b)</a>  of  the  NI  Act,  that\nreiterates the position of the point of time when the cause  of  action  has\narisen, leaves no manner of doubt that no offence can be said to  have  been\ncommitted unless and until the  period  of  15  days,  as  prescribed  under\nclause (c) of the proviso to <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_96\">Section 138</a>, has, in fact, elapsed.  Therefore,\na Court is barred in law from taking cognizance of  such  complaint.  It  is\nnot open to the Court to take cognizance of such a complaint merely  because\non the date of consideration or taking cognizance thereof  a  period  of  15\ndays  from  the  date  on  which  the  notice  has  been   served   on   the\ndrawer/accused has elapsed. We have no doubt that  all  the  five  essential\nfeatures of <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_97\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act, as noted  in  the  judgment  of  this\nCourt in Kusum Ingots &amp; Alloys Ltd.19 and which we have  approved,  must  be\nsatisfied for a complaint to be filed  under  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_98\">Section  138</a>.  If  the  period\nprescribed in clause (c) of the proviso to  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_99\">Section  138</a>  has  not  expired,\nthere is no commission of an offence nor accrual  of  cause  of  action  for\nfiling of complaint under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_100\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_46\">38.         We, therefore, do not approve the view taken by  this  Court  in\nNarsingh Das Tapadia1 and so also  the  judgments  of  various  High  Courts\nfollowing Narsingh Das Tapadia1 that if the complaint under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_101\">Section  138</a>  is\nfiled before expiry of 15 days from  the  date  on  which  notice  has  been\nserved on the drawer/accused the same is premature and if  on  the  date  of\ntaking cognizance a period of 15 days from the date of service of notice  on\nthe drawer/accused has expired,  such  complaint  was  legally  maintainable\nand, hence, the same is overruled.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\">39.         Rather, the view taken by  this  Court  in  Sarav  Investment  &amp;\nFinancial Consultancy2 wherein this Court held that  service  of  notice  in\nterms of <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_102\">Section 138</a> proviso (b) of the <a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_103\">NI Act</a> was a part of  the  cause  of\naction for lodging the complaint and communication to the accused about  the\nfact of dishonouring of the cheque  and  calling  upon  to  pay  the  amount\nwithin 15 days was imperative  in  character,  commends  itself  to  us.  As\nnoticed by us earlier, no complaint can be maintained against the drawer  of\nthe cheque before the expiry of 15 days from the date of receipt  of  notice\nbecause the drawer/accused cannot be said  to  have  committed  any  offence\nuntil then. We approve the decision of this  Court  in  Sarav  Investment  &amp;\nFinancial Consultancy2 and also the judgments of the High Courts which  have\ntaken the view following this judgment that the complaint under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_104\">Section  138</a>\nof the NI Act filed before the expiry of 15 days of service of notice  could\nnot be treated as a complaint in the eye of  law  and  criminal  proceedings\ninitiated on such complaint are liable to be quashed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_48\">40.         Our answer to question (i) is, therefore, in the negative.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_49\">41.         The other question is that if the answer to question (i)  is  in\nthe negative, can the complainant be  permitted  to  present  the  complaint\nagain notwithstanding the fact that  the  period  of  one  month  stipulated\nunder <a href=\"/doc/595945/\" id=\"a_105\">Section 142(b)</a> for the filing of such a complaint has expired.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_50\">42.         <a href=\"/doc/595945/\" id=\"a_106\">Section 142</a> of the NI Act prescribes the mode and  so  also  the\ntime within which a complaint for an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_107\">Section  138</a>  of  the  NI\nAct can be filed. A complaint made under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_108\">Section 138</a> by  the  payee  or  the\nholder in due course of the cheque has to be in  writing  and  needs  to  be\nmade within one month from the date on which the cause of action has  arisen\nunder clause (c) of the proviso to <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_109\">Section 138</a>.  The  period  of  one  month\nunder <a href=\"/doc/595945/\" id=\"a_110\">Section 142(b)</a> begins from the date on which the cause of  action  has\narisen under clause (c) of the proviso  to  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_111\">Section  138</a>.  However,  if  the\ncomplainant satisfies the Court that he had sufficient cause for not  making\na complaint within the prescribed period of one month, a  complaint  may  be\ntaken by the Court after the prescribed period. Now,  since  our  answer  to\nquestion (i) is in the negative, we observe that the payee or the holder  in\ndue course of the cheque may file a fresh complaint within  one  month  from\nthe date of decision in the criminal case  and,  in  that  event,  delay  in\nfiling the complaint will be treated  as  having  been  condoned  under  the\nproviso to clause (b) of <a href=\"/doc/595945/\" id=\"a_112\">Section 142</a> of the NI Act. This direction shall  be\ndeemed to be applicable to all such pending cases where the  complaint  does\nnot proceed further in view of our  answer  to  question  (i).  As  we  have\nalready held that a complaint filed before the expiry of 15  days  from  the\ndate of receipt of notice issued under clause (c) of the proviso to  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_113\">Section\n138</a> is not maintainable, the complainant cannot be permitted to present  the\nvery same complaint at any later stage. His remedy is only to file  a  fresh\ncomplaint; and if the same could not be filed  within  the  time  prescribed\nunder <a href=\"/doc/595945/\" id=\"a_114\">Section 142(b)</a>, his recourse is to seek the benefit  of  the  proviso,\nsatisfying  the  Court  of  sufficient  cause.  Question  (ii)  is  answered\naccordingly.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_51\">43.
