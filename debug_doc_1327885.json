AND ORS.\n\nDATE OF JUDGMENT: 23/02/2000\n\nBENCH:\nK.T. THOMAS &amp; D.P. MOHAPATRA\n\nJUDGMENT:</pre>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_1\">JUDGMENT\n\n2000 (1) SCR 1120\n\n\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by D.P. MOHAPATRA, J. Leave\ngranted.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_2\">The common question that arises for consideration in these appeals is\nwhether a company and its Directors can be proceeded against for having\ncommitted an offence under section 138 ot the Negotiable Instru-ments Act,\n1881 (for short &#x27;the <a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_1\">NI Act</a>&#x27;) alter the company has been declared sick\nunder the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/438563/\" id=\"a_2\">The Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions)\nAct, 1985</a> (for short &#x27;SICA&#x27;) before the expiry of the period for payment of\nthe cheque amount. The answer to the question depends on interpretation of\n<a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_3\">section 138</a> of the NI Act and its interaction with the relevant provisions\nof SICA. Since the relevant facts involved in all the cases are similar and\na common question of law arises in all the cases they were heard together\nand they are being disposed of by this judgment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">The factual positions about which there is no dispute may be stated thus :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">Post-dated cheques were issued on behalf ot the company in favour of the\ncomplainant in course of business of (he company. When the complainant\npresented the cheques in the bank they were returned without payment. Then\nthe complainant issued notice to the company and/or its Directors stating\nthe facts of dishonour of the cheques and demanding payment. Since no\npayment was made within the period of 15 days stipu-lated under the <a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_4\">NI Act</a>\nthe payee filed complaint against the company and/or its Directors alleging\ninter-alia that they had committed an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_5\">section 138</a> of the NI\nAct. Before the cheques were presented in the bank or after the bank\ndeclined to honour the cheques the drawer company was declared sick under\nthe provisions of the SICA by the Board of Industrial and Financial\nReconstruction (for short &#x27;BIFR&#x27;). On receipt of the summons from the Court\nin the criminal case registered on the basis of the complaint the accused\ncompany and/or its Directors filed petitions under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_6\">section 482</a> of the Code\nof Criminal Procedure or under <a href=\"/doc/1331149/\" id=\"a_7\">Article 227</a> of the Constitution seeking\nquashing of the complaint/proceeding in the criminal case, mainly on the\nground that in view of the provisions in <a href=\"/doc/1550523/\" id=\"a_8\">section 22</a> of SICA the criminal\ncase instituted against them for commission of the alleged offence under\n<a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_9\">section 138</a> NI Act is misconceived and compelling the accused to face trial\nin the case will amount to abuse of the process of Court. The High Court\nhaving declined to interfere in the proceeding and dismissed the petitions\nfiled by the accused, they have filed these appeals challenging the order\npassed by the High Court.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">The main thrust of the arguments of the learned counsel appearing for the\nappellants is that on the company being declared sick by the BIFR no steps\ncould be taken by the complainants for realisation of the amounts said to\nbe due to them and therefore the criminal proceeding initiated against the\ndrawer company and its Director on the allegation that the cheques drawn in\nfavour of the complainant were dishonoured by the bank is misconceived and\nshould be quashed; alternatively it is their contention that the\nproceedings in the criminal case should be stayed or suspended till the\naccused company becomes a functional and viable unit. On behalf of the\nappellants reliance is placed on <a href=\"/doc/1550523/\" id=\"a_10\">sections 22</a> and 22-A of the SICA.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">The learned counsel appearing for the respondents on the other hand contend\nthat on the undisputed fact situation of the case a prima-facie case under\n<a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_11\">section 138</a> of the NI Act is made out against the accused and on being\nsatisfied about this position the learned magistrate took cognizance of the\noffence and ordered issue of summons to the appellants. It is their\nsubmission that <a href=\"/doc/1550523/\" id=\"a_12\">section 22</a> has no application to, criminal proceedings and\nthat the said section does not bar payment of dues by the accused company\nor its Directors; an embargo is placed only on the creditors from realising\ntheir dues from the company by a proceeding for winding up or execution or\ndistress. It is also the submission of learned counsel for the respondents\nthat the criminal case cannot be said to be a proceeding for realisation of\nmoney due from the company.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">Before dealing with the rival contentions raised on behalf of the parties\nit will be convenient to note relevant provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_13\">NI Act</a> and SICA.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\"><a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_14\">Sections 138</a> to <a href=\"/doc/686130/\" id=\"a_15\">141</a> of the NI Act which are relevant for the purpose of the\ncase are quoted hereunder :\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">&quot;138.

In the\nexplanation to the section clarification is made that the phrase &quot;debt or\nother liability&quot; means a legally enforceable debt or other liability.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_17\"><a href=\"/doc/686130/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 141</a> NI Act is a provision specifically dealing with the offen-ces\nby companies. Therein it is laid down, inter alia, that if the person\ncommitting an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_36\">section 138</a> NI Act is a company, every person\nwho, at the time the offence was committed, was in charge of, and was\nresponsible to the company for the conduct of the business of the company,\nas well as the company, shall be deemed to be guilty of the offence and\nshall be liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly. Under the\nproviso to sub-section (1) it is laid down that nothing contained in this\nsub-section shall rendered any person liable to punishment if he proves\nthat the offence was committed without his knowledge, or that he had\nexercised all due diligence to prevent the commission of such offence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_18\">Sub-section (2) of the Section makes any director/manager/secretary or\nother officer of the company in connivance or any neglect on the part of\nwhom, an offence under the Act has been committed by the Company, such\ndirector/manager/secretary or other officer is deemed to be guilty of that\noffence and shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished\naccordingly.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">From the facts of the case alleged by the complainant gist of which has\nbeen noted earlier the position is clear that no exception can be taken\nagainst the order of the Magistrate taking cognizance of the offence under\n<a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_37\">section 138</a> NI Act against the appellants. Undisputedly the cheques were\ndrawn by the appellants for payment of certain amount of money due to the\ncomplainant, from the account in the bank and the said cheques were\ndishonoured by the bank and the amount remained unpaid even after lapse of\n15 days from the date of the notice issued by the complainant after the\ncheques were dishonoured. Therefore, the ingredients of <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_38\">section 138</a> being\nprima facie established from the complaint and the documents filed with it,\nthe Magistrate rightly took cognizance of the offence and issued summons to\nthe appellants.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_20\">The next question for consideration is whether under the provisions of the\nSICA there was any legal impediment lor payment of the amount for which the\ncheques were drawn and for that reason the appellants cannot be taken to\nhave committed an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_39\">section 138</a> NI Act. A bare reading of the\n<a href=\"/doc/1550523/\" id=\"a_40\">section 22</a> of the SICA makes the position clear that during pendency of an\ninquiry under <a href=\"/doc/1426531/\" id=\"a_41\">section 16</a> or during the preparation of a scheme referred to\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1269397/\" id=\"a_42\">section 17</a> or during implementation of a sanctioned scheme or\npendency of an appeal under <a href=\"/doc/1339273/\" id=\"a_43\">section 25</a>, no proceed-ings for winding up of\nthe industrial company or for execution, distress or the like against any\nof the properties of the industrial company or for the appointment of a\nreceiver in respect thereof and no suit for the recovery of money or for\nenforcement of any security against the industrial company or of any\nguarantee in respect of any loans or advance granted to the industrial\ncompany, shall lie or be proceeded with further, except with the consent of\nthe Board or, the Appellate Authority, as the case may be. The section only\ndeals with proceedings for recovery of money or for enforce-ment of any\nsecurity or a guarantee in respect of any loans or advance granted to the\ncompany and a proceedings for winding up of the company. The section does\nnot refer to any criminal proceeding. In M/s. B.S.I. Ltd. &amp; Anr. v. Gift\nHoldings Pvt. Ltd., Criminal Appeal No. 847 of (1999) we held that pendency\nof proceeding under <a href=\"/doc/1550523/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 22(1)</a> of SICA alone is not sufficient to get\nabsolved from the liability under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">A contention was raised on behalf of the appellants that if the criminal\ncase is proceeded with and the appellants are convicted and sentenced to\nfine then it will be necessary to realise the amount of fine from the\nassets of the company which would be impermissible in view of the\nprovisions of <a href=\"/doc/1550523/\" id=\"a_46\">section 22</a> of the SICA. We have no hesitation in rejecting\nthis contention. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"326620\" id=\"span_2\">In fact the same contention was considered by us at length\nin M/s. <a href=\"/doc/326620/\" id=\"a_47\">BSI Ltd. v. Gift Holdings, (Criminal Appeal No.</a> 847 of 1999) and it\nwas repelled. In our considered view the contention is premature and far-\nfetched as the occasion to realise fine from the accused company or its\ndirectors will arise only in case they are convicted and sentence of fine\nis imposed against them. That is not a ground to hold that the criminal\nproceeding should be foreclosed at the threshold.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_22\">Another contention which was raised on behalf of the appellant in this\nconnection is that if the Directors of the company on being convicted are\narrested and kept in jail the efforts of the BIFR for reconstruc-\ntion/revival of the company will not be possible and in that event the very\npurpose of inquiry by the BIFR will be rendered futile. The contention is\ntoo remote and the apprehension far-fetched. We reject the said conten-\ntion.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_23\">In our considered view <a href=\"/doc/1550523/\" id=\"a_48\">section 22</a> SICA does not create any legal impediment\nfor instituting and proceeding with a criminal case on the allegations of\nan offence under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_49\">section 138</a> of the NI Act against a company or its\nDirectors. The section as we read it only creates an embargo against\ndisposal of assets of the company for recovery of its debts. The purpose of\nsuch an embargo is to preserve the assets of the company from being\nattached or sold for realisation of dues of the creditors. The section does\nnot bar payment of money by the company or its directors to other persons\nfor satisfaction of their legally enforceable dues.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_24\">The question that remains to be considered is whether section 22 A of SICA\naffects a criminal case for an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_50\">section 138</a> NI Act. In the\nsaid section provision is made enabling the Board to make an order in\nwriting to direct the sick industrial company not to dispose of, except\nwith the consent of the Board, any of its assets - (a) during the period of\npreparation or consideration of the scheme under <a href=\"/doc/1423396/\" id=\"a_51\">section 18</a>; and (b) during\nthe period beginning with the recording of opinion by the Board for winding\nup of the company under sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/232831/\" id=\"a_52\">section 20</a> and up to\ncommencement of the proceedings relating to the winding up before the\nconcerned High Court. This exercise of the power by the Board is condi-\ntioned by the prescription that the Board is of the opinion that such a\ndirection is necessary in the interest of the sick industrial company or\nits creditors or shareholders or in the public interest. In a case in which\nthe BIFR has submitted its report declaring a company as &#x27;sick&#x27; and has\nalso issued a direction under section 22-A restraining the company or its\ndirectors not to dispose of any of its assets except with consent of the\nBoard then the contention raised on behalf of the appellants that a\ncriminal case for the alleged offence under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_53\">section 138</a> NI Act cannot be\ninstituted during the period in which the restraint order passed by the\nBIFR remains operative cannot be rejected outright. Whether the contention\ncan be accepted or not will depend on the facts and circumstances of the\ncase. Take for instance, before the date on which the cheque was drawn or\nbefore expiry of the statutory period of 15 days after notice, a restraint\norder of the BIFR under Section 22-A was passed against the company then it\ncannot be said that the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_54\">section 138</a> NI Act was completed. In\nsuch a case it may reasonably be said that the dishonouring of the cheque\nby the bank and failure to make payment of the amount by the company and/or\nits Directors is for reasons beyond the control of the accused. It may also\nbe contended that the amount claimed by the com-plainant is not recoverable\nfrom the assets of the company in view of the ban order passed by the BIFR.\nIn such circumstances it would be unjust and unfair and against the intent\nand purpose of the statute to hold that the Directors should be compelled\nto face trial in a criminal case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_25\">Except in the circumstances noted above we do not find any good reason for\naccepting the contentions raised by the learned counsel for the appellants\nin favour of the prayer for quashing the criminal proceedings or for\nkeeping the proceedings in abeyance. It will be open to the appellants to\nplace relevant materials in this regard before the learned Magistrate\nbefore whom the cases are pending and the learned Magistrate will ex-amine\nthe matter keeping in mind the discussions made in this judgment. We make\nit clear that we have not considered the question whether in the facts and\ncircumstances of a particular case <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 138</a> NI Act is attracted or not,\nfor that is a question to be considered by the Court at the appropriate\nstage of the case in the light evidence on record. The appeals are disposed\nof on the terms aforesaid.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n",
