In Cr.  A. No. 300 of 1971, accused Nos.\t1 to\n5 were convicted under<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_7\"> S. 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_8\">148</a> I.P.C. by both the  Courts\nbelow.\nThe alleged occurrence giving rise to the prosecution of the\nappellants  took place on the night between December 13\t and\n14  at\tabout  2 a.m. as a  result  of\tpolitical  animosity\nbetween\t  two\tgroups\tof  people-the\tMarxists   and\t the\nagriculturists\tcalled the &quot;Karshak Sangham&quot;, in  Puthupally\nvillage in Kottayam, Kerala.  The eyewitnesses, for fear  of\nretaliation,  did not report the crime to the police.\tOnly\non  the next day, a member of the local panchayat (P.W.\t 2),\nlodged the F.I.R. at 8 A.M. at Kottayam East Police Station,\n9 K.M. away from the place of occurrence.\nBefore\tthis  Court,  the following points  were  raised  on\nbehalf\tof the appellants :-(i) that the  first\t information\nreport\tis  highly belated and (ii) that  the  alleged\teye-\nwitnesses  did not lodge the complaint because they  had  in\nfact not witnessed the occurrence, and the accused have been\nfalsely implicated.  Partly allowing the appeal,\nHELD  :\t (i) The First Information Report  relating  to\t the\ncommission of an offence is not a condition precedent to the\nsetting in motion of a criminal investigation. [23 C]\nR. V. Khwaja, I.L.R. [1945] Lah. 1, referred to.\nNor  does the statute provide that such\t information  report\ncan  only  be made by on eye-witness.  F.I.R.  is  not\teven\nconsidered a substantive piece of evidence.  It can only  be\nused to corroborate or contradict the informants evidence in\ncourt.\t But this information when recorded is the basis  of\nthe  case  set up by the informant.  It is  very  useful  if\nrecorded before there is time and opportunity to  embellish,\nor before the informants&#x27; memory fades.\nUndue  or unreasonable delay lodging the F.I.R.,  therefore,\ngives rise to suspicion which put the Court on guard to look\nfor  the possible motive and the explanation for  the  delay\nand  consider  its  effect on  the  trustworthiness  of\t the\nprosecution  version.  No duration of time in  the  abstract\ncan be fixed as reasonably for giving information of a crime\nto  the\t police,  the question of reasonable  time  being  a\nmatter for determination by the court in each case. [23 E]\n(ii) In\t the , present case, the eye-witnesses were afraid\nto  go\tto the police station during night  time  and  their\nevidence could not be shaken in cross-examination Keeping in\nview  the  local  tense atmosphere and\tthe  effect  of\t the\nghastly\t  murder   on  the   eye-witnesses,   their   strong\ndisinclination\tto go and lodge the report during the  night\nafter the alleged\n17\nOccurrence,  which  seems quite normal,\t cannot.  by  itself\narouse\tany suspicion about the prosecution case.   Further,\nthe  prosecution version as a whole, has also been  accepted\nby both the Courts below for reasons which cannot be said to\nbe  unsound or implausible.  Therefore, the delay in  making\nthe F.I.R. has reasonably been explained by the\t prosecution\nwitnesses.\n(iii)  It is not disputed and indeed both the  Courts  below\nhave  found that on December 12, 1970, there was full  moon,\nand  ,is  such,\t there was moon-light at  the  time  of\t the\noccurrence.  The nearest street light was about 130 ft. away\ntowards\t the  west  and the nearest  electric  post  on\t the\neastern\t side  was  about  90 ft. away\tfrom  the  place  of\noccurrence.  The light of the lorry, which was at the place,\nalso helped eye witnesses to clearly see who the  assailants\nwere.\tThe  concurrent conclusion of the two  Courts  below\nleaves\tno doubt that the witnesses present at the place  of\noccurrence  were in a position to clearly see  and  identify\nthe  accused  persons  who  \\were  not\tstrangers  to  them.\nTherefore,  conviction of accused Nos.\t1 to 5 under<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_9\"> S.\t 302</a>\nI.P.C.\tand<a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_10\"> S. 148</a> is upheld as also the Sentence  under  <a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_11\">S.\n148</a> I.P.C. Accused No. 6 has also been rightly found  guilty\nand his sentence is also confirmed.\n(iv)As\tregards accused Nos. 7 to 10, they did not  form  an\nunlawful  assembly  with the common object  of\tkilling\t the\ndeceased.  Therefore, they are acquitted.\nKhanna J. (dissenting) Held (i) From the evidence on  record\nit was difficult to subscribe to the view that the witnesses\nrefrained from reporting the matter to the police soon after\nthe  occurrence because of fear.  The witnesses had not\t got\ninto  the lorry while the accused were on foot.\t  It&#x27;  would\nnot have taken the lorry more than 15 or 20 minutes to reach\nthe  police  station.  Further, it cannot be said  that\t the\nwitnesses  were not conscious of the necessity of  informing\nthe police about the occurrence.\n(ii) Even  if the witnesses were afraid to go to the  police\nstation in the night, they could have gone to the station in\nthe  morning because they did not remain confined  in  their\nhomes;\tbut were moving about and go to different places  on\nthe following morning, there is no satisfactory\t explanation\nas  to why they did not go to the police station and make  a\nreport.\t Their failure to report to the police the following\nday, creates considerable doubts about the veracity of their\nevidence.\nThulia Kali v. State of Tamil Nadu Cr.\tA. 165/71 decided on\nFebruary 25, 1972, referred to.\n(iii)\t  Further, the prosecution evidence is of a partisan\ncharacter.\n(iv) The  circumstances\t of the case tend to show  that\t the\ndeceased  was killed at late hour during the night  between\nDecember  13  and 14, 1970 when he was coming from  a  place\nwhere  he  had\ttaken toddy.  The fact that  no\t report\t was\nlodged\twith the police during the night and no one went  to\nthe  village or raised a hue and cry tends to show  that  no\none  was  present  along with the  deceased  at\t that  time.\nTherefore;  it is not possible to sustain the conviction  of\nthe  accused appellants on the evidence adduced in the case.\n\n\n\nJUDGMENT:</pre>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_1\">CRIMINAL APPELLANT JURISDICTION : CRIMINAL Appeals Nos.\t 300\niiid 263 of 1971.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_2\">Appeals\t front\tthe jud-ii-ient and order dated\t August\t 24,\n1971  of the Hi,-h Court in Criiiiin,,ii Appeals Nos.  6(1)-\nto  168 ti)d  R.

Kuruvilla who met them at\t the\nPuthupully  junction requested them to accompany him to\t the\nhouse of Yesu Kathanar (Christian priest) (P.W. 5) which was\non  the western side of Puthupally junction.

On  seeing them P.W.  3\tstopped\t his\nlorry.\t One Achankunju was also in the lorry with  P.W.  3.\nAfter stopping the lorry P.W. 3 told these four persons that\naccused\t no.  2 and others were coming that way\t armed\twith\ndeadly weapons.\t P.W. 3 accordingly asked these four persons\nnot  to\t proceed towards Puthupally junction, at  the  same\ntime  offering to take them in his lorry.  By the time\tthis\nconversation  was over the accused had already\treached\t the\nscene of occurrence.  As soon as they arrived there  accused\nno.  1\tApren  Joseph  struck a blow  with  his\t chopper  on\nKuruvilla&#x27;s  head.

The  sole\targument  vehemently\npressed\t upon  us  is, that no one saw\tthe  deceased  bring\nmurdered  and the accused have been falsely  implicated,  on\naccount\t of  enmity, by the prosecution witnesses  who\thave\ndeposed to an imaginary story concocted by them.  &#x27;there  is\nof  course no dispute that there was  considerable  ill-will\nbetween\t the  workers  of the Marxist  party  in  the  local\nPuthupalli  area  and the members of  the  Krishak  Sangham.\nIndeed,\t even  according to the accused, there\thad  been  a\nquarrel between these two groups about 20 days prior to\t the\noccurrence  in dispute.\t Some. of the accused  persons\twere\ninvolved in-other criminal cases as well.  But enmity as  is\nwell-known is a doubleedged weapon.  Whereas the accused may\nrely  on it in support of their plea of\t false\timplication,\nthe  prosecution on the other ,hand may\t legitimately  argue\nthat this provided the necessary motive for the offence.  It\nis that none of the persons who claim to have been with\t the\ndeceased  since\t about 10-30 p.m. right up to  the  time  of\noccurrence informed the police or made any attempt to do so:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">nor did K. Achan Kunju who was sitting in the lorry next  to\nMathayi\t (P.W.\t3).   Mathayi, however, does  state  in\t his\nevidence  that he made an attempt to contact the  police  on\ntelephone  but the telephone line being out of order he\t did\nnot  succeed.  This, he did, from the house  of\t Attupurathu\nPunnachan where he stopped for this purpose on his way\tback\nhome  from  the\t house of Achan (P.W.  5).   The  contention\nforcefully pressed before us is that P.W. 3 who was  driving\nthe  lorry could have driven straight to the police  station\nand   lodged  the  necessary  information.   Indeed  &#x27;\t the\nsubmission proceeds like this.\tAfter having left the  scene\nof the alleged murder P.W. 3 and his companions in the lorry\ncould and should have gone straight to the police station to\nlodge  the first information report.

This should have been considered to  be\tmore\nimportant  than\t going to his home.  The fact that  none  of\nthese persons considered it important enough or even  proper\nto  go and lodge the first information report shows that  no\none witnessed the murder and the whole story deposed by\t the\nprosecution witnesses in court is a concoction which is\t the\noutcome of the fertile brain of P.Ws. 1, 3, 4 and 5 and does\nnot represent the truth.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">Now  first  information report is a report relating  to\t the\ncommission.  of an offence given to the police and  recorded\nby  it\tunder  s. 154, Cr.

The bad condition of the  road,\nnot permitting the lorry to go faster than six or ten  miles\nper hour. as stated by\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">26</span>\nP.W. 3, may also have consciously or unconsciously  deterred\nthem,  to  some extent, from risking a visit to\t the  police\nstation\t during the night.  In this connection it would\t not\nbe unimportant to bear in mind that P.W. 3 did not possess a\ndriving\t licence  and he would naturally have  hesitated  in\ndriving\t the  lorry to the police station.   The  concurrent\nconclusions  of the two courts ,below on this point  deserve\nserious consideration and cannot ,be lightly brushed  aside.\nBut  that apart, it would also need a ,highly  creative\t and\nfertile brain to cook up an imaginary story embodying in it,\nthe peculiar features of the prosecution case, and that also\nwithin\ta short span of time, after learning of the  on\t the\nmorning of December 14, 1970 and before making the statement\nto the police at noon the same day as deposed by P.Ws. 1 and\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">14.   In  fact\tP.W. 2, a member of  Panchayat,\t who  is  no\npartisan and whose statement is corroborated by P.W. 14 had,\nalready\t informed the police (per Ex.

This\t adds to the vulnerability  of\tthe  defence\nversion.   Features which seem peculiar for their  insertion\nin  an imaginary story which could hardly be  circulated  so\nearly as to reach P.W. 2 to enable him to go to the spot and\nthen to go to lodge the F.I.R. at 9 a.m. are (i) bringing on\nthe scene (a) a lorry driven by its owner (P.W. 3) who\tdoes\nnot  belong  to Karshak Sanghani and who normally  does\t not\ndrive that lorry and does not even possess a driving licence\nbut has employed a wholetime driver for the said lorry;\t (b)\nthe other eye witnesses along with the companion of P.W.  3,\nKadiyathuruthil\t Achan\tKunju  who has\tnot  appeared  as  a\nwitness, (ii) to make P.W. 3 drive the eye witnesses to the\nhouse of Achan for dropping them there. after having dropped\nKadiayathuruthil Achan Kunju on the road, and finally  (iii)\non  his way back home to make P.W. 3 attempt  unsuccessfully\nto  contact  the  police  on telephone\tfrom  the  house  of\nAttupurathu  Punnachan.\t What is more intriguing is that  as\nmany  as ten accused persons should have been  involved\t but\nonly five assigned overt acts in the murder and one only  an\ninjury\twith a wooden spear to P.W. 4, the  rest  (including\naccused\t no  10, the Secretary of the Marxist  Party)  being\nonly  involved as members of the unlawful assembly.

To begin with it is not\nunderstood  where  was the necessity of introducing  P.W.  3\ninstead\t of  his driver.  And then what was the\t reason\t for\nbringing Kadiyathuruthil Achan Kunju in the picture when  he\nwas  not  to appear as a witness.  It is also  not  easy  to\nunderstand,   on   the\t evidence  and\t in   the   peculiar\ncircumstances  of  this\t case, as  to  how  the\t prosecution\nwitnesses deposing about the occurrence, other than P.W.  3,\nmanaged to get together for consultation, after learning  of\nthe  murder and then how, where and when, did  they  contact\nP.W. 3 with the object of prevailing upon him to take up the\nimportant role in this drama and subscribe to this imaginary\nstory.\t P.W. 3 was cross-examined at great length  but\t his\ncredibility was not at all shaken.  He said in a  forthright\nmanner that he had &#x27; reached his house on the fateful  night\nat about 2 a.m. and on the following morning at about 6 or 7\nO&#x27;clock he went to Eramalloor from where he returned at 5.30\np.m. and it was then that he learnt about Kunju&#x27;s death.  He\nhad, however, narrated the incident to his wife and  brother\non  reaching his house at 2 a.m. His statement was  recorded\nby the police at about 7 p.m. on his return from Eramalloor.\nHis testimony appears to be straightforward and\t impressive,\nand it has been believed by the courts below.  No convincing\narguconcoctedstory  P.W. 3 could not reasonably have  been\nassigned a role ofsuch\tvital importance.   Indeed,  his\npresence  seems\t to  be a strong factor\t which\trenders\t the\ndefence\t theory incredible and establishes the truth of\t the\nprosecution  version.  But apart from the inherent  weakness\nof the theory of the story having been concocted to  falsely\nimplicate the accused persons, the prosecution version as  a\nwhole has also been accepted by both the trial court and the\nHigh Court for reasons which cannot be said to be unsound or\nimplausible.   In  fact,  there\t appears to  be\t a  ring  of\nintrinsic truth in this version.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">The trial court believed the version given by P.W. 4 as also\nthe  testimony of, P. Ws. 1, 3 and 5. P.W. 5 was not an\t eye\nwitness to the occurrence but he fully corroborated that the\ndeceased  and  P.Ws 1, 4 and Baby had gone to him  by  11.30\np.m.  and later at 1.30 a.m. The three persons,\t other\tthan\nthe  deceased,\treturned  to him and  informed\thim  of\t the\noccurrence.  The trial court felt that P.W. 5 had no  reason\nto  falsely swear against the accused.\tThe story  given  by\nP.Ws,  1,  3 and 4 was considered by the trial court  to  be\nconsistent  and reliable.

It  is no longer necessary  to\ngive  reasons for the lesser penalty. The  determination  of\nsentence   in  a  given\t case  depends\ton  a\tvariety\t  of\nconsiderations, the more important being, the nature of\t the\ncrime,\tthe  manner  of its  commission.  the  motive  which\nimpelled  it  and  the\tcharacter  and\tantecedents  of\t the\naccused.  So far as the accused before us are concerned it\n3 0\nappears\t that in their excessive zeal for their\t party\tthey\nfelt unduly provoked by the success of the meeting organised\nby  the\t Karshak Sangham and being  misguided  by  political\nintolerance and cult of violence they committed the offences\nin  question  soon after the said meeting.   We,  therefore,\nfeel  that the interest of justice would be fully served  in\nthis case if we substitute the sentence of imprisonment\t for\nlife  for the sentence of death.

We have reduced the sentence of death to that\t &#x27;of\nlife  imprisonment  on accused nos.  1 to 5  in\t this,\tcase\nbecause\t of  the peculiar circumstances\t already  mentioned.\nThe sentence under s. 148 I.P.C. would be concerned with the\nsentence under s. 302 I.P.C.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_27\">The  appeals are, accordingly disposed of as stated in\tthis\njudgment.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_28\">KHANNA,\t J.

As regards accused 6 to 10, it was observed\tthat\nit  was not necessary to show that they had  committed\tsome\nillegal\t overt\tact  or\t had been  guilty  of  some  illegal\nomission.    In\t  the  opinion\tof   the   High\t  Court,-the\ncircumstances  of the case showed that all the accused\twere\nmembers\t of an unlawful assembly and that the common  object\nof that assembly was to do away with Kunju deceased, who had\nearlier\t on that day organized the meeting.  In the  result,\naccused 6 to 10 were also convicted as mentioned earlier.\nIt  cannot be disputed that Kunju deceased died as a  result\nof    the  various injuries which were inflicted  upon\thim.\nAccording  to  Dr. George Paul, who  performed\tpost  mortem\nexamination  on\t the  body of the deceased,  there  were  21\ninjuries  on the body of the deceased, out of which  7\twere\nincised\t wounds,  one  was a stab wound\t and  two  were\t cut\nwounds.\t  Besides that, there were four\t contused  abrasions\nand 7 abrasions.

As against  that,\nDr.  Mahmood  on behalf of the State has canvassed  for\t the\ncorrectness of the view taken by the High Court.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">35</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_45\">This Court normally does not interfere with the appraisement\nof evidence of the trial court and the High Court, but\tthat\nfact would not prevent this Court from interfering if it  is\nfound  on  scrutiny  of the evidence that  it  suffers\tfrom\nglaring\t infirmities.\tAs many as five\t persons  have\tbeen\nsentenced  to death in this case and five others  have\tbeen\nsentenced   to\tundergo\t imprisonment  for  life.    It\t  is\nessential, in my opinion, that the evidence should be  clear\nand  cogent, so as to bring the charge home to\tthe  accused\nbeyond all reasonable doubt.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_46\">According  to the prosecution case, Pappu (PW 1) and  Joseph\n(PW 4) were going with Kunju deceased from the house of Yesu\nPW at about I am when Kunju was attacked by the party of the\naccused.   Mathayi  (PW\t 3) claims  to\thave  witnessed\t the\noccurrence because, according to him, he arrived at the spot\nshortly\t before the occurrence in his lorry after  paying  a\nvisit  to a contractor.\t It is also in the evidence  of\t the\nthree  witnesses  that\tsoon after the\taccused\t had  caused\ninjuries to Kunju and the latter had fallen down, Pappu\t and\nMathayi\t PW  s along with Baby, who too was with  them,\t got\ninto  Mathews&#x27; lorry which was then driven away by  Mathayi.\nThe  conduct  of  these\t witnesses if  they  had,  in  fact,\nwitnessed  the occurrence after that was most unnatural\t for\nnone, of them made any serious attempt to inform the  police\nabout  the occurrence.\tIt is in the evidence of  the  above\nmentioned  witnesses that at first Achan-Kunju\twas  dropped\nfrom  the lorry at the next junction at a distance of  about\none  furlong  from the scene of occurrence.  Thereafter\t the\nlorry  was  taken  by Mathayi at the request  of  Pappu\t and\nothers\tto the house of Yesu PW and Pappu PW, Joseph PW\t and\nBaby  were  dropped there in front of  that  house.  Mathayi\nthereafter  took the lorry to his own house.  Pappu,  Joseph\nand  Baby  after  informing Yesu about\tthe  occurrence\t are\nstated to have slept at Yesu&#x27;s house, while Mathayi remained\nat  his own house. There is nocogent explanation as  to\t why\nthe above mentioned witnesses did not go at that time in the\nlorry  to  the police station and lodge a report  about\t the\noccurrence.  If, in fact, a murderous assault had been\tmade\non  Kunju deceased in their presence, this would  have\tbeen\nthe  normal  reaction of the eye witnesses. No\tattempt\t was\nmade  in the judgment of Narayana Pillai J., who  wrote\t the\nmain judgment of the High Court, to find any explanation for\nthe above conduct of the eye witnesses. Moidu J., who  added\na  small  note,\t mentioned that the  above  was\t indeed\t the\nprincipal  contention which had been advanced on  behalf  of\nthe  accused.In\t the  opinion  of  the\tlearned\t Judge,\t the\nwitnesses could not have dared to go out of the place  where\nthey were staying for the night after the gruesome murder. I\nfind  it  difficult  to\t subscribe  to\tthe  view  that\t the\nwitnesses  reframed from reporting the matter to the  police\nsoon after the occurrence because of fear.  The witnesses\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">36</span>\nhad got into the lorry, while the accused were on foot.\t The\npolice\tstation\t was at a distance of only  nine  kilometers\nfrom  the place of occurrence.\tIt would not have taken\t the\nlorry  more  than  15  or 20 minutes  to  reach\t the  police\nstation.  There could be no apprehension in the minds of the\nwitnesses that they would be overtaken and assaulted by\t the\naccused because the accused were on foot while the witnesses\nhad the advantage of being in a lorry.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_47\">It also cannot be said that the witnesses were not conscious\nof   the  necessity  of\t informing  the\t police\t about\t the\noccurrence.   According\t to Mathayi (PW 3), he went  to\t the\nhouse of one Attupurathu Punnachan before going to his house\nand tried to send telephonic intimation to the police.\t The\nwitness\t added that he could not contact the police  because\nthe telephone line was out of order.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_48\">Another\t unnatural feature of the conduct of Pappu,  Mathayi\nand  Joseph  PWs is that they made no attempt to see  as  to\nwhat  was the condition of Kunju deceased after the  assault\nand  whether  the deceased needed some\tThe  witnesses\twere\napparently  not\t aware at the time they left  the  scene  of\noccurrence  that Kunju had died because according  to  their\nevidence  they\tshouted at that time to the accused  not  to\nkill  Kunju.   Had  Kunju  died\t in  the  presence  of\t the\nwitnesses,  there  would  have\tbeen  no  occasion  for\t the\nwitnesses to shout to the accused at the time they left\t not\nto kilt the deceased.  Indeed, according to Mathayi (PW\t 3),\nhe came to know of the death of Kunju only on the&#x27; following\nday  at\t 5.30 p.m. It may also be observed in  this  context\nthat  the evidence of Dr. Paul, who performed  post  mortem\nexamination  on\t the body of the deceased,  shows  that\t the\ndeceased  might\t have  survived\t for  some  time  after\t the\nassault.  It also cannot be said that the witnesses did\t not\ngo  out of fear after the occurrence to the place where\t the\ndeceased  was lying because in the normal course  of  events\nthe assailants do not remain at the spot of occurrence after\nthe assault.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_49\">Even if it may be assumed that Pappu, Mathayi and Joseph PWs\nwere  afraid to go to the police station in the darkness  of\nthe  night,  there  appears to be  no  justification  cogent\nreason\tfor  their not reporting the matter  to\t the  police\nearly oil the following morning-.  It is in evidence that on\nthe following morning the about.  According to Pappu (PW  1)\nhe went to Puthupally in a bus on the following morning\t and\npassed\tthrough\t the spot where the dead body of  Kunju\t was\nlying.\t The witness did not step down from the bus  despite\nthe fact that he saw the dead body lying there.\t Mathavi (PW\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_50\">3) admits that he went on the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">37</span>\nfollowing  morning  at 6 a.m. to Erumeli and  returned\tfrom\nthat  place  at 5.30 p.m. Joseph PW states that he  went  to\nVakathanam  Hospital  by bus at 7.15 a.m. on  the  following\nmorning.  If the three eye witnesses could move about and go\nto  different places on the following morning, there  is  no\nsatisfactory  explanation as to why they did not go  to\t the\npolice station and make a report about the occurrence if, in\nfact,  Kunju  deceased\thad been subjected  to\ta  murderous\nassault\t in their presence.  The failure of  Pappu,  Mathayi\nand  Joseph PWs to report the matter to the  police  creates\nconsiderable  doubt  about the veracity of the\tevidence  of\nthese  witnesses  that\tthey had seen  the  accused  causing\ninjuries to the deceased.  This Court in the case of  Thulia\nKali v. State of Tamil Nadu (Criminal Appeal No. 165 of 1971\ndecided\t on  February 25, 1972) stressed the  importance  of\nmaking prompt report to the police regarding the  commission\nof cognizable offence.\tIt was observed :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">\t      &quot;First  information report in a criminal\tcase\n\t      is  an extremely vital and valuable  piece  of\n\t      evidence for the purpose of corroborating, the\n\t      oral  evidence  adduced  at  the\ttrial.\t The\n\t      importance of &#x27;the above report can hardly  be\n\t      overestimated  from  the\tstandpoint  of\t the\n\t      accused.\tThe object of insisting upon  prompt\n\t      lodging of the report to the police in respect\n\t      of commission of an offence is to obtain early\n\t      information  regarding  the  circumstances  in\n\t      which  the crime was committed, the  names  of\n\t      the  actual  culprits and the part  played  by\n\t      them  as\twell as the names of  eye  witnesses\n\t      present at the scene, of occurrence.  Delay in\n\t      lodging  the  first information  report  quite\n\t      often  results  in embellishment\twhich  is  a\n\t      creature\tof  afterthought.   On\taccount\t  of\n\t      delay, the report not only gets bereft of\t the\n\t      advantage of spontaneity, danger creeps in  of\n\t      the    introduction   of\t coloured    version\n\t      exaggerated  account or concocted story  as  a\n\t      result  of deliberation and consultation.\t  It\n\t      is,  therefore,  essential that the  delay  in\n\t      lodging of the first information report should\n\t      be satisfactorily explained.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_51\">Apart from the above infirmity in the evidence of three\t eye\nwitnesses,  I  find that the prosecution evidence  is  of  a\npartisan  character and not such on which implicit  reliance\ncan  be\t placed.   Pappu  (PW 1) admits\t that  there  was  a\ncriminal case between his cousin and the fifth accused\tfive\nor  six\t months before the present  occurrence.\t  Pappu\t was\nasked  whether be was a member of the Karshaka Sangham.\t  He\ndenied\tthis fact though he admitted that he had paid  money\nto Kunju for the meeting of Karshaka Sangham which had\tbeen\nearlier\t held  on the day of occurrence.   The\tevidence  of\nJoseph PW, however, shows that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">38</span>\nPappu  is  a member of Karshaka Sangham.  Joseph  PW  admits\nthat  there  were two cases against him\t for  good  conduct.\nJoseph\tand  two others were also sentenced to pay  fine  in\nconnection with an assault on a tapper.\t There was also some\nproperty dispute in which Joseph and Kunju were arraigned as\naccused\t but  they were acquitted.  Joseph is  a  member  of\nKarshaka Sangham and was earlier also cited as a witness  in\na case against the accused.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_52\">The prosecution has tried to seek corroboration of the\tevi-\ndence  of eye witnesses from the testimony of Yesu ( PW\t 5),\nwho  has  deposed that on the night of occurrence  at  first\nKunju  deceased\t came  to his house  accompanied  by  Pappu,\nJoseph\tand  Baby, and that subsequently Pappu,\t Joseph\t and\nBaby  came to the house and informed him of the\t occurrence.\nYesu,  as  already  stated  earlier,  is  the  President  of\nKarshaka Sangham in Eramalloor.\t It is admitted by Yesu that\nhe was accused in a case concerning the church.\t He was also\naccused\t in another criminal case.  One other case had\tbeen\nfiled against him.  Shortly before his evidence in court  he\nwas  accused  in  a  case filed in  the\t court\tof  District\nMagistrate.   Yesu was also a prosecution witness in a\tcase\nin the Court of Sub-Divisional Magistrate Kottayam in  which\ncertain\t remarks  were made against Yesu.   Yesu  thereafter\nfiled  a petition in the High Court for expunging those\t re-\nmarks.\tYesu was asked whether a finding had been given in a\ncivil  case  that he had forged a document.   Yesu  admitted\nthat  there had been such a case, but according to  him,  it\nrelated to the correction of a document.  It further in\t the\nevidence  of  Yesu  that the police had sent  up  for  trial\nYesu&#x27;s\tson and four others for causing injuries to  accused\nNo.  10. In view of the above, I find it difficult to  place\nmuch reliance upon his testimony.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_53\">Reference has also been made by Dr. Mahmood to the fact that\nan incised wound was found on the person of Joseph PW by Dr.\nNair when he examined Joseph on the morning of December\t 14,\n1970.\tIt is urged that the aforesaid injury was caused  to\nJoseph\tby accused No. 6 with a wooden spear.  The  presence\nof the said injury, according to the learned counsel,  lends\nassurance to the testimony of Joseph that he was present  at\nthe  scene  of\toccurrence.  In this  respect  I  find\tthat\naccording  to  Dr.  Paul,  who\tis  Assistant  Professor  of\nForensic  Medicine  in\tMedical\t College,  Trivendrum,\t the\nincised\t wound could not be caused with a wooden  spear\t and\nthat such a spear would cause only a lacerated injury.\t Dr.\nPauL&#x27;s\ttestimony  thus\t creates some  doubt  regarding\t the\nreliability  of\t the prosecution evidence  that\t Joseph\t had\nreceived  injury with a wooden spear at the hand of  accused\nNo.  6.\t In any case the aforesaid injury  could  have\tbeen\ncaused\t in  a\tvariety\t of  circumstances  and\t would\t not\nnecessarily  show  that Joseph was present at the  scene  of\noccurrence.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">\t\t\t     39</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_54\">The  circumstances of the case tend to show that  Kunju\t de-\nceased\twas killed at a late hour during the  night  between\nDecember 13 and December 14, 1970 when he was coming from  a\nplace where he had taken toddy.\t The fact that no report was\nlodged\twith the police during the night and no one went  to\nthe, village abadi and raised hue and cry tends to show that\nno  one\t was present along with the deceased at\t that  time.\nHis  dead body, it seems, was discovered in the morning\t and\nthereafter a report was lodged by Markose who admittedly was\nnot  a\twitness of the occurrence.  Markose  in\t the  report\nmentioned  the names of only accused 1, 2, 3, 7 and  8\tand,\naccording to him, he had heard that someone out of them\t had\nkilled Kunju deceased.\tIn my opinion, it is not possible to\nsustain\t the  conviction of the accused\t appellants  on\t the\nevidence adduced in the case.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_55\">I,  therefore, accept the appeal, set aside  the  conviction\nand acquit the accused.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">40</span>\n\n\n\n",
