The prosecution case was that he  and\t the\ndeceased  were last seen together in village J\ton  November\n10, 1974 by PW. 7, owner of a dhaba-cum-liquor shop, and PW.\n8, and all of them had consumed liquor. The deceased had  by\nthen become tipsy. Thereafter the appellant and the deceased\nhad  boarded  a truck driven by A-2 and\t A-3,  the  cleaner.\nWhile  they were going in the truck there ensued  a  quarrel\nbetween\t them  over  some money matters\t and  the  appellant\nattacked  the deceased with an iron screw driver,  and\twhen\nthe  latter was half dead all the accused severed  his\thead\nwith  an  iron saw and burried the trunk under\tstones.\t The\nhead was hidden at a different place. Three days later,\t PW-\n6, chowkidar of a neighboring village noticed the dead\tbody\nand  reported the matter to PW-10, the village pradhan,\t who\naccompanied  him to the spot. PW-6 lodged the FIR  the\tnext\nmorning. On receiving information that the deceased and\t the\nappellant  were\t seen consuming liquor on  November  10\t the\nSub-Inspector, PW-27, and PW-10 went to appellant&#x27;s  village\nand  took him for identification to village J, where  PWs  7\nand  8\tidentified  him as one seen in the  company  of\t the\ndeceased  and  having  consumed liquor.\t The  appellant\t was\nthereafter taken to PW-10&#x27;s village and PW-27 proceeded\t for\nfurther\t investigation.\t The appellant then made  an  extra-\njudicial  confession to PW-10 of having committed the  crime\nwith the help of A-2 and A-3. PW-10 passed on that  informa-\ntion to PW-27 the next day following which the accused\twere\narrested. Thereafter A-2 made a statement under<a href=\"/doc/412448/\" id=\"a_10\"> s. 27</a> of\n106\nthe  <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_11\">Evidence Act</a> leading to the&#x27; discovery of\tthe  severed\nhead.  The  weapon of offence was also recovered.  The\tHigh\nCourt confirmed the conviction and sentence of the appellant\nbut acquitted the other two of the charge under<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_12\"> s. 302</a> IPC.\nAllowing the appeal by special leave, the Court,\n    HELD:  1. The prosecution has failed to bring  home\t the\nguilt  to the appellant beyond all reasonable doubt  and  to\nprove  that he alone had committed the crime. He is,  there-\nfore, entitled to the benefit of doubt. [116D]\n    2.1 When there is no direct witness to the commission of\nmurder\tand the case rests entirely on\tcircumstantial\tevi-\ndence,\tall the circumstances from which the  conclusion  of\nthe guilt is to be drawn should be fully and cogently estab-\nlished.\t The proved circumstances should be of a  conclusive\nnature and definite tendency unerringly pointing towards the\nguilt  of the accused. Imaginary possibilities have no\trole\nto play. What is to be considered are ordinary human  proba-\nbilities.  It  is not necessary that  each  circumstance  by\nitself\tbe  conclusive but cumulatively must  form  unbroken\nchain  of  events leading to the proof of the guilt  of\t the\naccused.  If  any of the said circumstances  are  consistent\nwith the innocence of the accused or the chain of the conti-\nnuity  of the circumstances is broken, the accused is  enti-\ntled to the benefit of the doubt. [112D-H]\n    2.2\t In assessing the evidence to find these  principles\nit  is necessary to distinguish between facts which  may  be\ncalled\tprimary or basic facts on one hand and inference  of\nfacts to be drawn from them, on the other. In regard to\t the\nproof of basic or primary facts, the court has to judge\t the\nevidence  in  the ordinary way and in  appreciation  of\t the\nevidence  in  proof of those basic facts or  primary  facts,\nthere  is  no scope for the application of the\tdoctrine  of\nbenefit of doubt. The court has to consider the evidence and\ndecide whether the evidence proves a particular fact or not.\nWhether that fact leads to the inference of the guilt of the\naccused\t or not is another aspect and in dealing  with\tthis\naspect\tof the problem, the doctrine of benefit would  apply\nand  an inference of guilt can be drawn only if\t the  proved\nfacts are inconsistent with the innocence of the accused and\nare consistent only with his guilt. [113A-C]\n    3.1\t In the instant case, from the evidence it is  clear\nthat  there was no prior intimacy of the appellant  and\t the\ndeceased. They happened to meet per chance. PW-7, the liquor\nshop owner, and PW-8, who had\n107\nliquor\twith the appellant and the deceased were also  abso-\nlute strangers to the deceased and the appellant. Admittedly\nthere was no identification parade conducted by the prosecu-\ntion  to identify the appellant by PW-7 or PW-8. The  appel-\nlant was stated to have pointed out to PW-7 as the one\tthat\nsold  the liquor and PW-8 consumed it with him and  the\t de-\nceased.\t Therefore, it is not reasonably possible to  accept\nthe testimony of the PW-7 and PW-8 when they professed\tthat\nthey  had seen the appellant and the deceased together\tcon-\nsuming the liquor. It is highly artificial and appear on its\nface a make believe story. [113F-H]\n    3.2.1 An unambiguous extra-judicial confession possesses\nhigh  probative value force as it emanates from\t the  person\nwho  committed the crime and is admissible in evidence\tpro-\nvided it is free from suspicion and suggestion of its falsi-\nty.  But in the process of the proof of the alleged  confes-\nsion  the court has to be satisfied that it is\ta  voluntary\none  and  does not appear to be the  result  of\t inducement,\nthreat or promise envisaged under<a href=\"/doc/967059/\" id=\"a_13\"> s. 24</a> of the Evidence\t Act\nor was brought about in suspicious circumstances to  circum-\nvent ss, 25 and 26 of the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_14\">Evidence Act</a>. For this purpose the\ncourt  must  scrutinise all the relevant facts such  as\t the\nperson to whom the confession is made, the time and place of\nmaking it, the circumstances in which it was made and final-\nly the actual words used by the accused. [114A-D]\n    3.2.2  <a href=\"/doc/494844/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 25</a> of the Evidence Act provides  that  no\nconfession  made  to  a police officer shall  be  proved  as\nagainst a person accused of any offence. <a href=\"/doc/387768/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 26</a> provides\nthat  no  confession made by any person while  he  is  under\ncustody\t of  the police officer, unless it be  made  in\t the\nimmediate  presence  of\t a magistrate, shall  be  proved  as\nagainst such person. [114G]\n    3.2.3  In the instant case, the appellant did  not\tmake\nany  confession in the presence of the magistrate. From\t the\nnarrative  of the prosecution story it is clear that  PW  10\nand  the  appellant did not belong to the same\tvillage\t and\nthat  PW-27  and  PW-10 came together  and  apprehended\t the\nappellant  from\t his village and took him to village  J\t for\nidentification. After he was identified by PW-7 and PW-8  it\nwas stated that he was brought back to the village of  PW-10\nand  was  kept\tin his company and PW-27  left\tfor  further\ninvestigation.\tIt is incredible to believe that the  police\nofficer, PW-27 after having got an accused identified  would\nhave left without taking him into custody. He seems to\thave\ncreated\t an artificial scenario of his leaving\tfor  further\ninvestigation  and keeping the appellant in the\t custody  of\nPW-10  to make an extra-judicial confession, with a view  to\navoid the rigour of<a href=\"/doc/494844/\" id=\"a_17\"> ss. 25</a> and\n<a href=\"/doc/985205/\" id=\"a_18\">108</a>\n<a href=\"/doc/387768/\" id=\"a_19\">26</a>.  Nothing  prevented him from taking the appellant  to  a\nJudicial  Magistrate and having his confession\trecorded  as\nprovided under<a href=\"/doc/228024/\" id=\"a_20\"> s. 164</a> of the Crl. P.C. which possesses great\nprobative  value  and affords an unerring assurance  to\t the\ncourt. It is too incredulous to believe that for mere asking\nto tell the truth the appellant made voluntary confession to\nPW-10  and that too sitting in a hotel. The other person  in\nwhose  presence\t it  was stated to have been  made  was\t not\nexamined  to provide any corroboration to the  testimony  of\nPW-10.\tIt would be legitimate, therefore, to conclude\tthat\nthe  appellant was taken into police custody and the  extra-\njudicial  confession  was obtained there through  PW-10\t who\naccommodated the prosecution. [115A-E]\n    3.2.4  It is well settled law that<a href=\"/doc/494844/\" id=\"a_21\"> ss. 25</a> and <a href=\"/doc/387768/\" id=\"a_22\">26</a> of\t the\nEvidence  Act  shall be construed  strictly.  Therefore,  by\noperation  of<a href=\"/doc/387768/\" id=\"a_23\"> s. 26</a> the confession made by the appellant  to\nPW-10  while  he was in the custody of\tthe  police  officer\nshall not be proved against him. [115E]\n    3.3\t The statement said to have been made by the  appel-\nlant under s 27 of the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_24\">Evidence Act</a> leading to discovery  of\nthe consequential information, namely. saw blade, is not  of\na conclusive nature connecting the appellant with the crime.\nThe recoveries were made long after the arrest of the appel-\nlant. The blood stains on all the articles had\tdisintegrat-\ned.  So\t it was not possible to find whether  it  was  human\nblood or not. Moreover, from the prosecution evidence it  is\nclear that the deceased himself was an accused in an earlier\nmurder\tcase  and it is obvious that he had enemies  at\t his\nback. Absolutely no motive to commit the crime was attribut-\ned to the appellant. [115G-H]\n    4. The conviction and sentence of the appellant for\t the\noffences  under<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_25\"> ss. 302</a> and <a href=\"/doc/386021/\" id=\"a_26\">201</a> IPC are set aside. The\tbail\nbond  shall  stand  cancelled. He shall\t remain\t at  liberty\nunless he is required in any other case. [116D]\n    5. Indulging in free fabrication of evidence against  an\ninnocent and implicating him in the capital offence punisha-\nble under<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_27\"> s. 302</a> IPC, as in the instant case, is a  deplora-\nble  conduct  on the part of an investigating  officer.\t The\nliberty of a citizen is a precious one guaranteed by consti-\ntutional  provisions  and its deprivation shall be  only  in\naccordance  with law. Before accusing the appellant  of\t the\ncommission  of\tsuch a grave crime an  honest,\tsincere\t and\ndispassionate  investigation should have been made  to\tfeel\nsure  that he alone was responsible to commit  the  offence.\n[117B; A]\n109\n\n\n\nJUDGMENT:</pre>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_1\">    CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Criminal Appeal No. 386\nof 1978.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_2\">    From the Judgment and Order dated 19/20th July, 1977  of\nthe Himachal Pradesh High Court in Crl.

Tah. Kangra  on\nNovember,  10,\t1974.  while going to  Pathankot  with\tsome\ncurrency  notes in his possession went on his way to  Jassur\nVillage to meet his friend one Bala Pahalwan. On enquiry the\nlatter\twas said to be absent in the village.  The  deceased\ncame  in  contact with the appellant and both  went  to\t the\nDhaba of PW. 7, Joginder Singh Paul to have some drink,\t but\nPW.  7 did not allow them to take liquor inside\t the  Dhaba.\nBoth  of  them\tsat in the back side of the  Dhaba  to\thave\ndrink. PW. 8 Tamil Singh and one Jai Onkar were also invited\nto  have drink with them. All of them together consumed\t the\nliquor\tand  ate meat. The deceased paid the  price  of\t the\nliquor and meat and when he had become tipsy, PW. 8 suggest-\ned to take the deceased to Pathankot or to keep him at Dhaba\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">110</span>\nBeli where at he could make necessary arrangements for their\nstay but the appellant insisted upon taking the deceased  to\nKangra.\t Thereafter the appellant and the  deceased  boarded\nthe Truck No. HPK 4179 driven by A. 2, Madho Ram, Driver and\nA.  3,\tBihari Lal, Cleaner. PW. 8 and the  other  left\t the\nplace.\tThe truck was loaded with the bricks and the  appel-\nlant  and the deceased sat on the bricks in the body of\t the\ntruck and went towards Kangra side. PW. 12, the Octroi Clerk\nat Nagpur states that the truck driven by A. 2 went  towards\nBaijnath.  PW.\t13. Burfiram, Chowkidar at  Ichhi  Marketing\nCo-op.\tSociety spoke that he saw the truck driven by  A.  2\nand  A. 3 and got unloaded the bricks at the godown  of\t the\nsaid  Society  at about mid-night but the deceased  was\t not\nseen  there. It is further the case of the prosecution\tthat\nwhile the deceased or accused were going in the truck, there\nensued a quarrel between them over some money matter and the\nappellant took iron-screw driver and gave blows on the\thead\nand face of the deceased. Consequently the deceased was half\ndead.  He  was thrown out of the truck but finding  him\t not\ndead  put him in the truck and all the accused\tsevered\t the\nhead with an iron saw and burried the trunk under stones  in\nthe  outskirts\tof the village Dhadhu and carried  the\thead\nwith  them  in\tthe truck. The head was hidden\tat  a  place\nbetween Guggal and Chaitru on the Kachcha road branching off\nthe  main road to the village Ichhi. On November  13,  1974,\nPW.  6\tKarrudi Ram, the Chowkidar of  Mauza  Bandi,  during\ntwilight, had gone to answer nature&#x27;s call at the  outskirts\nof  the\t village Dhadhu and noticed the blood stains  and  a\ntorn pant near the stones. On further probe the hand of\t the\ndeceased was seen projecting from the stones and he  noticed\nthe  dead body. He went and reported to Bidhu Ram,  PW.\t 10.\nthe Pradhan of the village and two others. All of them\twent\nto  the\t spot, noticed the dead body. PW. 10  kept  a  watch\nduring the night. On November 14, 1974 at about 7.00 or 8.00\na.m.  PW. 6 went to the Police Station and lodged  the\tcom-\nplaint.\t PW.  26, the A,S.I. recorded and issued  the  First\nInformation  Report and proceeded to the spot. He  recovered\nthe articles on and near the dead body under PW. 11,  Panch-\nnama and conducted inquest and sent the dead body for  post-\nmortem.\t The Doctor conducted autopsy. On November 15.\t1974\nthe  parents of the deceased came to the Police Station\t and\nidentified  the\t clothes of the deceased.  On  November\t 16,\n1974, PW. 27, the Sub Inspector of the Police took over\t the\ninvestigation. He contacted one Kuldip Singh, a Conductor in\nKapila\tTransport Company from whom he came to know that  on\nNovember 10, 1974, the deceased and the appellant were\tseen\nconsuming  liquor at Jassur. Thereafter PW. 27 and  PW.\t 10,\nBidhu  Ram, Pradhan of Guggal Panchayat went to\t the  appel-\nlant&#x27;s\tvillage Sahaura and was sent for the appellant.\t The\nappel-\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">111</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\">lant  on  coming  to him was found to have  shaved  off\t his\nmoustaches. PW. 27 had enquired as to why he had removed his\nmoustoches  upon  which the appellant was  claimed  to\thave\nreplied that he had removed his moustaches due to demise  of\nhis maternal uncle. PW. 10 and PW. 27 took the appellant  to\nJassur\tfor identification purposes. The  appellant  pointed\nout PW. 7, the owner of the Dhaba and the latter  identified\nthe appellant as one seen in the company of the deceased and\nhaving\tconsumed  liquor. Equally of PW. 8.  Thereafter\t the\nappellant was taken back to PW. 10&#x27;s village and PW. 27 left\nthe  village for further investigation. On enquiry  made  by\nPW. 10, in the shop of one Mangath Ram and in the company of\none Raghunath, to reveal the truth to him, the appellant was\nstated to have requested PW. 10 whether he could save him if\nhe  would  tell the truth. Thereupon PW. 10 stated  that  he\ncould not save him but if he would speak the truth he  would\nhelp  himself.\tThereupon the appellant was stated  to\thave\nmade  extra  judicial confession giving out the\t details  of\nconsuming liquor with the deceased; their going together  on\nthe truck, the quarrel that ensued between them; his hitting\nthe deceased with the screw-driver, throwing the..dead body,\nthinking that he died, on the road realising that he was not\ndead,  lifting him and putting him in the body of the  truck\nand  all the accused cutting the head of the  deceased\twith\nthe  saw blade and burrying the trunk under the\t stones\t and\nhiding\tthe  head at different place and  thereby  they\t had\ncommitted the crime. PW. 10 gave this information to PW.  27\non the next day, namely, November 25, 1974. Thereon all\t the\naccused were arrested. On November 27, 1974, the Driver A. 2\nwas  stated  to\t have made a statement under<a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_31\"> s.\t 27</a>  of\t the\nEvidence Act. Ex. PW. 9/A leading to discovery of the hidden\nhead  at a place between Guggal and Chaitru. This  statement\nhad  been made in the presence of PW. 9 and another and\t the\nsevered head was recovered under Memo Ex. PW. 9/B. This\t was\nin the presence of PW. 10 and another. The head was sent  to\nthe Doctor for post-mortem examination. The Doctor  verified\nand  found  it to be correct and the  doctor  corelated\t the\ntrunk  of  the dead body and the head belonging to  the\t de-\nceased. On November 30., 1974, pursuant to statement made by\nthe appellant and A. 3 under Ex. PW. 16/B leading to recover\none iron-saw without handle and a piece of cloth-wrapped  to\none of its sides was recovered from a bush near Kathman\t Mor\nand PW. 10 and another are Panch witnesses and found the saw\nblade  contained with blood stains and a piece of  cloth  of\ntorn  pant.  They  were recovered under Ex.  PW.  16/C.\t The\nclothes\t of  the appellant were also claimed  to  have\tbeen\nrecovered  from\t his  house under Ex.  PW.  16/H  which\t was\nstained\t with  blood  and the same  were  recovered  in\t the\npresence  of  PW. 16 The Serologist found the  blood  stains\ndisintegrated on all the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">112</span>\nitems.\tOn the basis of this evidence the  prosecution\tlaid\nthe  chargesheet against all the accused. As stated  earlier\nthe  appellant\tnow stands convicted and sentenced  for\t the\noffences  under<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_32\"> ss. 302</a> and <a href=\"/doc/386021/\" id=\"a_33\">201</a>, I.P.C. The two\t others\t did\nnot file appeal against their convict under<a href=\"/doc/386021/\" id=\"a_34\"> s. 201</a> I.P.C.\n    The\t entire\t prosecution case rested  on  circumstantial\nevidence. As regards the appellant, the circumstances relied\non  the prosecution are three, namely,(i) the appellant\t and\nthe deceased were last seen together by PW. 7, the owner  of\nthe  liquor  shop  Dhaba and PW. 8, the\t companion  who\t had\nliquor\twith the deceased and the appellant; (ii) the  extra\njudicial  confession made to PW. 10, the Pradhan  of  Guggal\nGram Panchayat; and (iii) the discovery of saw blade  pursu-\nant to the statement made by the appellant and A. 3 under<a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_35\"> s.\n27</a> of the Evidence Act.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_7\">    The\t question,  therefore, is  whether  the\t prosecution\nproved\tguilt of the appellant beyond all reasonable  doubt.\nIn a case of circumstantial evidence. all the  circumstances\nfrom which the conclusion of the guilt is to be drawn should\nbe  fully and cogently established. All the facts so  estab-\nlished should be consistent only with the hypothesis of\t the\nguilt of the accused. The proved circumstances should be  of\na conclusive nature and definite tendency, unerringly point-\ning towards the guilt of the accused. They should be such as\nto  exclude  every  hypothesis but the one  proposed  to  be\nproved. The circumstances must be satisfactorily established\nand the proved circumstances must bring home the offences to\nthe accused beyond all reasonable doubt. It is not necessary\nthat each circumstances by itself be conclusive but  cumula-\ntively\tmust  form unbroken chain of events leading  to\t the\nproof of the guilt of the accused. If those circumstances or\nsome  of  them\tcan be explained by any\t of  the  reasonable\nhypothesis  then the accused must have the benefit  of\tthat\nhypothesis.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\">    In\tassessing the evidence imaginary possibilities\thave\nno role to play. What is to be considered are ordinary human\nprobabilities.\tIn other words when there is no direct\twit-\nness to the commission of murder and the case rests entirely\non circumstantial evidence, the circumstances relied on must\nbe  fully established. The chain of events furnished by\t the\ncircumstances should be so far complete as not to leave\t any\nreasonable  ground for conclusion consistent with the  inno-\ncence of the accused. If any of the circumstances proved  in\na  case are consistent with the innocence of the accused  or\nthe chain of the continuity of the circumstances is  broken,\nthe accused is entitled to the benefit of the doubt.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">113</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">    In\tassessing the evidence to find these principles.  it\nis  necessary  to  distinguish between facts  which  may  be\ncalled\tprimary or basic facts on one hand and inference  of\nfacts to be drawn from them. on the other. In regard to\t the\nproof of basic or primary facts. the court has to judge\t the\nevidence  in  the ordinary way and in  appreciation  of\t the\nevidence  in  proof of those basic facts or  primary  facts,\nthere  is  no scope for the application of the\tdoctrine  of\nbenefit of doubt. The court has to consider the evidence and\ndecide whether the evidence proves a particular fact or not.\nWhether that fact leads to the inference of the guilt of the\naccused\t or not is another aspect and in dealing  with\tthis\naspect\tof the problem\tthe doctrine of benefit would  apply\nand  an inference of guilt can be drawn only if\t the  proved\nfacts are inconsistent with the innocence of the accused and\nare consistent only with his guilt. There is a long distance\nbetween may be true and must be true. The prosecution has to\ntravel\tall the way to establish fully the chain  of  events\nwhich should be consistent only with hypothesis of the guilt\nof the accused and those circumstances should be of  conclu-\nsive  nature  and  tendency and they should be\tsuch  as  to\nexclude all hypothesis but the one proposed to be proved  by\nthe  prosecution. In other words. there must be a  chain  of\nevidence so far consistent and complete as not to leave\t any\nreasonable  ground  for\t a conclusion  consistent  with\t the\ninnocence of the accused and it must be such as to show that\nwithin\tall probability the act must have been done  by\t the\naccused and the accused alone.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">    The question emerges, therefore is whether the  prosecu-\ntion  has  established\tthe  three  circumstantial  evidence\nheavily banked upon by the prosecution in proof of the guilt\nof  the\t appellant. The first circumstance is that  the\t de-\nceased\tand the appellant were last seen together by  PW.  7\nand  PW. 8. From the evidence it is clear that there  is  no\nprior  intimacy\t of  the appellant and\tthe  deceased.\tThey\nhappened to meet per chance. Equally from the evidence it is\nclear  that PW. 7, the liquor shop owner and PW. 8  who\t had\nliquor with the appellant and the deceased are also absolute\nstrangers  to  the deceased and\t the  appellant.  Admittedly\nthere is no identification parade conducted by the  prosecu-\ntion tO identify the appellant by PW. 7 or PW. 8. The appel-\nlant was stated to have pointed out to PW. 7 as the one that\nsold  the liquor and PW-8 consumed it with him and  the\t de-\nceased.\t Therefore it is not reasonably possible  to  accept\nthe  testimony of PW. 7 and PW. 8 when they  professed\tthat\nthey  have  seen  the appellant and  the  deceased  together\nconsuming the liquor. It is highly artificial and appears on\nits face a make believe story.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">114</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">    The next piece of evidence is the alleged extra judicial\nconfession  made by the appellant to PW. 10. An\t unambiguous\nextra  judicial\t confession possesses high  probative  value\nforce as it emanates from the person who committed the crime\nand  is\t admissible  in evidence provided it  is  free\tfrom\nsuspicion and suggestion of its falsity. But in the  process\nof  the proof of the alleged confession the court has to  be\nsatisfied that it is a voluntary one and does not appear  to\nbe  the\t result of inducement, threat or  promise  envisaged\nunder <a href=\"/doc/967059/\" id=\"a_36\">section 24</a> of the Evidence Act or was brought about in\nsuspicious circumstances to circumvent <a href=\"/doc/494844/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 25</a> and <a href=\"/doc/387768/\" id=\"a_38\">26</a>  of\nthe Evidence Act. Therefore, the court has to look into\t the\nsurrounding  circumstances  and to find\t whether  the  extra\njudicial  confession  is  not inspired by  any\timproper  or\ncolateral consideration or circumvention of the law suggest-\ning that it may not be true one. For this purpose the  court\nmust scrutinise all the relevant facts such as the person to\nwhom  the confession is made, the time and place  of  making\nit,  the circumstances in which it was made and finally\t the\nactual words used by the accused. Extra judicial  confession\nif  found to be voluntary, can be relied upon by  the  court\nalongwith  other  evidence on record.  Therefore,  even\t the\nextra  judicial confession will also have to be proved\tlike\nany other fact. The value of the evidence as to the  confes-\nsion depends upon the verocity of the witness to whom it  is\nmade  and the circumstances in which it came to be made\t and\nthe actual words used by the accused. Some times it may\t not\nbe possible to the witness to reproduce the actual words  in\nwhich  the  confession\twas made. For that  reason  the\t law\ninsists on recording the statement by a Judicial  Magistrate\nafter  administering all necessary warnings to\tthe  accused\nthat it would be used as evidence against him.\n    Admittedly PW. 10 and the appellant do not belong to the\nsame village. From the narrative of the prosecution story it\nis  clear that PW. 27, and PW. 10 came together\t and  appre-\nhended\tthe  appellant\tfrom his village and  was  taken  to\nJassur for identification. After he was identified by PW.  7\nand  PW. 8 it was stated that he was brought back to  Gaggal\nvillage\t of  PW. 10 and was kept in his company and  PW.  27\nleft  for further investigation. <a href=\"/doc/494844/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 25</a> of the  Evidence\nAct  provides  that no confession made to a  police  officer\nshall be proved as against a person accused of any  offence.\n<a href=\"/doc/387768/\" id=\"a_40\">Section\t 26</a> provides that no confession made by\t any  person\nwhile  he is under custody of the police officer, unless  it\nbe made in the immediate presence of a magistrate, shall  be\nproved\tas  against such person. Therefore,  the  confession\nmade by an accused person to a police officer is  irrelevant\nby  operation of <a href=\"/doc/494844/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 25</a> and it shall be  proved  against\nthe appellant. Likewise the confession made by the appellant\nwhile he is in the custody of the police shall not\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">115</span>\nbe  proved  against the appellant unless it is made  in\t the\nimmediate  presence of the magistrate, by operation of\tSec-\ntion  26 thereof. Admittedly the appellant did not make\t any\nconfession in the presence of the magistrate. The  question,\ntherefore, is whether the appellant made the extra  judicial\nconfession while he was in the police custody. It is incred-\nible  to  believe  that the police officer,  PW.  27,  after\nhaving\tgot identified the appellant by PW. 7 and PW.  8  as\nthe  one  last seen the deceased in his company\t would\thave\nleft  the appellant without taking him into custody.  It  is\nobvious, that with a view to avoid the rigour of <a href=\"/doc/494844/\" id=\"a_42\">Section  25</a>\nand <a href=\"/doc/387768/\" id=\"a_43\">26</a>, PW. 27 created an artificial scenerio of his leaving\nfor  further  investigation and kept the  appellant  in\t the\ncustody\t of  PW. 10, the Pradhan to make an  extra  judicial\nconfession.  Nothing prevented PW. 27 to take the  appellant\nto a Judicial Magistrate and had his confession recorded  as\nprovided under <a href=\"/doc/228024/\" id=\"a_44\">section 164</a> of the Crl. P.C. which  possesses\ngreat  probative value and affords an unerring assurance  to\nthe  court. It is too incredulous to believe that  for\tmere\nasking\tto  tell the truth the\tappellant  made\t voluntarily\nconfession  to PW. 10 and that too sitting in a\t hotel.\t The\nother  person in whose presence it was stated to  have\tbeen\nmade  was not examined to provide any corroboration  to\t the\ntestimony  of PW. 10. Therefore, it would be  legitimate  to\nconclude that the appellant was taken into the police custo-\ndy  and\t while\tthe accused was in the\tcustody,  the  extra\njudicial confession was obtained through PW. 10 who accommo-\ndated the prosecution. Thereby we can safely reach an  irre-\nsistible conclusion that the alleged extra judicial  confes-\nsion  statement\t was  made while the appellant\twas  in\t the\npolice custody. It is well settled law that <a href=\"/doc/494844/\" id=\"a_45\">Sections 25</a>\t and\n<a href=\"/doc/387768/\" id=\"a_46\">26</a>  shall be construed strictly. Therefore, by operation  of\n<a href=\"/doc/387768/\" id=\"a_47\">Section\t 26</a> of the Evidence Act, the confession made by\t the\nappellant  to  PW.  10 while he was in the  custody  of\t the\npolice\tofficer\t (PW. 27) shall not be\tproved\tagainst\t the\nappellant.  In\tthis view it is unnecessary to go  into\t the\nvoluntary nature of the confession etc.\n    The\t third circumstance relied on is the statement\tsaid\nto  have been made by the appellant under <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_48\">section 27</a> of\t the\nEvidence  Act  leading\tto discovery  of  the  consequential\ninformation,  namely,  saw  blade, is not  of  a  conclusive\nnature connecting the appellant with the crime. The recover-\nies  were long after the arrest of the appellant. The  blood\nstains on all the articles were disintegrated. So it was not\npossible to find whether it is human blood or not. Moreover,\nfrom the prosecution evidence it is clear that the  deceased\nhimself\t was an accused in an earlier murder case and it  is\nobvious\t that  he  had enemies at his  back. Absolutely no\nmotive to commit crime was attributed to the appellant.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">116</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_12\">    No doubt the appellant and two others have been  charged\nfor  an offence under section 302 and 201 read with  <a href=\"/doc/94346/\" id=\"a_49\">Section\n34</a>, namely, common intention to commit the offences and A. 2\nand A. 3 were acquitted of the charge under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_50\">section  302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_51\">34</a>,\nI.P.C. and that there is no independent charge under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_52\">section\n302</a>,  I.P.C. If, from the evidence, it is  established\tthat\nany one of the accused have committed the crime\t individual-\nly,  though the other accused were acquitted,  even  without\nany  independent  charge under section 302,  the  individual\naccused\t would be convicted under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_53\">section 302</a>,\tI.P.C.\tsim-\nplicitor. The omission to frame an independent charge  under\nsection\t 302,  I.P.C. does not vitiate\tthe  conviction\t and\nsentence under section 302, I.P.C.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_13\">    Thus considered we find that the prosecution has utterly\nfailed\tto prove any one of the three circumstances  against\nthe  appellant and the chain of circumstances was broken  at\nevery stage without connecting the accused to the commission\nof the alleged crime as the prosecution failed to prove as a\nprimary\t fact all the three circumstances, much less  beyond\nall reasonable doubt bringing home the guilt to the accused,\nand to prove that the accused alone had committed the crime.\nTherefore,  the\t appellant  is entitled to  the\t benefit  of\ndoubt. The conviction and sentence of the appellant for\t the\noffences under section 302 or <a href=\"/doc/386021/\" id=\"a_54\">Section 201</a> of I.P.C. are\t set\naside. The appellant is on bail granted by this Court  after\nnine  years&#x27; incarceration. The bail bond shall\t stand\tcan-\ncelled. He shall remain at liberty unless he is required  in\nany other case.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">    Before  parting with the case, it is necessary to  state\nthat from the facts and circumstances of this case it  would\nappear\tthat the investigating officer has taken the  appel-\nlant, a peon, the driver and the cleaner for ride and  tram-\npled upon their fundamental personal liberty and lugged them\nin the capital offence punishable under section 302.  <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_55\">I.P.C</a>.\nby  freely  fabricating evidence against the  innocent.\t Un-\ndoubtedly. heinous crimes are committed under great  secrecy\nand that investigation of a crime is a difficult and tedious\ntask.  At the same time the liberty of a citizen is  a\tpre-\ncious  one guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1659104/\" id=\"a_56\">Art. 3</a> of Universal Declaration  of\nHuman  Rights and also <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_57\">Art. 21</a> of the Constitution of  India\nand  its deprivation shall be only in accordance  with\tlaw.\nThe  accused  has the fundamental right\t to  defend  himself\nunder <a href=\"/doc/492977/\" id=\"a_58\">Art. 10</a> of Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\t The\nright to defence includes right to effective and  meaningful\ndefence at the trial. The poor accused cannot defend  effec-\ntively\tand  adequately. Assigning  an\texperienced  defence\ncounsel to an indigent accused is a facet of fair  procedure\nand  an\t inbuilt right to liberty and life  envisaged  under\nArts.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">117</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">    19 and 21 of the Constitution. Weaker the person accused\nof an offence, greater the caution and higher the  responsi-\nbility\tof the law enforcement agencies. Before accusing  an\ninnocent person of the commission of a grave crime like\t the\none punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_59\">section 302</a>, I.P.C., an honest, sincere\nand  dispassionate investigation has to be made and to\tfeel\nsure  that the person suspected of the crime alone  was\t re-\nsponsible to commit the offence. Indulging in free  fabrica-\ntion of the record is a deplorable conduct on the part of an\ninvestigating  officer which under-mines the  public  confi-\ndence reposed in the investigating agency. Therefore, great-\ner  care and circumspection are needed by the  investigating\nagency\tin  this regard. It is time that  the  investigating\nagencies,  evolve new and scientific investigating  methods,\ntaking\taid of rapid scientific development in the field  of\ninvestigation.\tIt is also the duty of the State, i.e.\tCen-\ntral  or State Government to organise  periodical  refresher\ncourses for the investigating officers to keep them  abreast\nof the latest scientific development in the art of  investi-\ngation and the march of law so that the real offender  would\nbe brought to book and the innocent would not be exposed  to\nprosecution.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_16\">    Though <a href=\"/doc/169871995/\" id=\"a_60\">Art. 39A</a> of the Constitution provides fundamental\nrights\tto equal justice and free legal aid and\t though\t the\nState provides amicus curiae to defend the indigent accused,\nhe would be meted out with unequal defence if, as is  common\nknowledge the youngster from the Bar who has either a little\nexperience or no experience is assigned to defend him. It is\nhigh  time that senior counsel practicing in the court\tcon-\ncerned, volunteer to defend such indigent accused as a\tpart\nof  their  professional duty. If these\tremedial  steps\t are\ntaken and an honest and objective investigation is done,  it\nwill  enhance  a sense of confidence of the  public  in\t the\ninvestigating agency.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_17\">    We\tfervently hope and trust that concerned\t authorities\nand  Senior Advocates would take appropriate steps  in\tthis\nregard.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_18\">The appeal is accordingly allowed.\n</p><pre id=\"pre_2\">P.S.S.\t\t\t\t\t Appeal allowed.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">118</span>\n\n\n\n</pre>",
