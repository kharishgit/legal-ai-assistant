DHARMADHIKARI\n\nJUDGMENT:</pre>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1\">JUDGMENT\n\n\n2002 Supp(3) SCR 339\n\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\n\nDHARMADHIKARI, J. &quot;Frailty thy name is woman&quot;, that is how in one his plays\nShakespeare described one of the female characters in his play. This\ndescription is more and more in evidence particularly in rural Indian\nsociety where married women, who are unable to muster courage to fight\nagainst cruelty and harassment meted out to them by their spouses and\nfamily members, find no escape other than ending their own life.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_2\">The deceased Krishna Kumari second daughter of PW1 was married to Yadla\nSrinivasa Rao (hereinafter referred to as accused No.1), on 26.6.1998.\nAccused No. l was employed as Branch Post Master in the village where the\nspouses lived jointly with the parents of accused No.1.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">At the time of marriage father of the deceased, who was a teacher, gave a\ncash dowry of Rupees fifteen thousand and jewels worth fifteen thousand\nbesides gift of five acres of land and a house site in the course of\nmarriage ritual described as &quot;Pasupukumkuma&quot;. It is explained that this\ngift of land was in the nature of &#x27;Stridhana&#x27; given to the bride by the\nfather for her maintenance.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">After three or four months of the marriage accused No.1, husband of the\ndeceased started demanding in from the deceased execution of a deed in his\nfavour of the land and house site gifted to her. Refusal on the part of the\ndeceased to meet the demand was the cause of her continuous harassment.\nTaking advantage of his position as the Post Master in the village, accused\nNo.1 never delivered mail sent to the deceased by her father and her sister\nNagamani. Her younger sister after passing tenth class examination had to\nappear for Polytechnic Entrance Test. As a part of harassment of the\ndeceased, accused No.1 did not deliver the Entrance Card received from\nKakatiya University addressed to the younger sister of the deceased which\nresulted in the former losing the admission to the test.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">The deceased somehow was able to lay her hands on the letters addressed to\nher and which had been concealed by accused No. 1. On finding those\nletters, she handed over the same to her father. This incident led to\nextreme point of harassment. Accused No. l and his parents, accused Nos.\n2-3, drove the deceased out from their house with stern warning to her to\nrestore those letters. This incident of cruelty was so grave and unbearable\nthat she committed suicide by consuming a poisonous insecticide Endo-\nSulphan on 22.10.1989. PW4, who had witnessed the incident of the deceased\nhaving been driven out of the house the previous day, also saw accused No.1\ntaking deceased to the hospital at Madhira. PW4 informed about it to father\n(PW1) of the deceased who rushed to the house of the accused to find\nKrishna Kumari, dead. The father then lodged a First Information Report,\nEx. P1 within eight hours on the same day.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">All the three accused were charged in Session Case No. 157 of 1999 by the\nCourt of Assistant Sessions judge, Nuzwid for offence of dowry death under\n<a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 304B</a>, IPC and in the alternative under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 498A</a>, IPC for\ncruelty and harassment of such magnitude as to drive the deceased to commit\nsuicide. The prosecution examined the parents of the deceased of PW 1-2.\nPW3-4 were examined who had seen the deceased being driven out of the house\nand taken back only on their persuasion.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">The trial court by judgment dated 19.8.1991 accepted the evidence led by\nthe prosecution of alleged cruel treatment and harassment of the deceased\nwhich drove her to commit suicide. It, however, held that on the evidence\nonly offence under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 498A</a>, IPC is made out. It acquitted them of the\noffence under <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 304B</a>, IPC. The three accused on their conviction for\noffence under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 498A</a> were sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for two\nyears and a fine of Rs. 500 each. In default of payment of fine, they were\nsentenced to two months simple imprisonment each.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">The appellants i.e. parents of the deceased filed Criminal Revision No.\n564/91 in the High Court of Andhra Pradesh against the acquittal of the\naccused under <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 304B</a>, IPC. The accused preferred Criminal Appeal No.\n1291/99 before the High Court of Andhra Pradesh assailing their conviction\nand sentences.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">The learned Single Judge of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh decided the\nrevision preferred by the parents of the deceased and the appeal preferred\nby the accused by a common Judgment dated 24.8.1994 which is the subject\nmatter of these two separate criminal appeals preferred by the parents of\nthe deceased and the State of Andhra Pradesh.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">The learned Single Judge of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh dismissed the\nCriminal Revision filed by the parents of the deceased and confirmed the\nverdict of the trial court that the accused are liable to conviction and\nsentences only under <a href=\"/doc/1868826/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 498</a>, IPC and not under <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 304B</a>. <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_9\">IPC</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">By the same common judgment the High Court allowed the appeal preferred by\naccused Nos. 2-3 (Parents of accused No.1) and acquitted them of the\nalleged offences.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">Against the common judgment of the High Court, State of Andhra Pradesh has\npreferred Criminal Appeal Nos. 1458-59 of 1995 challenging the acquittal of\naccused Nos. 2-3 and the parents of the deceased have preferred connected\nCriminal Appeal No. 1457 of 1995 seeking conviction of all the accused\nunder <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 304B</a> of the IPC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_13\">The High Court in its common judgment passed in Criminal Appeal and\nCriminal Revision before it after appreciating the evidence led against\naccused Nos. 2-3, has found that the allegation against them of their\nparticipation with accused No.1 in driving out the deceased from their\nhouse was for the first time made by PW-1 father of the deceased only in\nhis deposition in the Court. At no earlier point of time either in the\nfirst information report Ex.Pl or in the statements made under <a href=\"/doc/447673/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 161</a>\nof Cr.P.C. to the police, such allegation was made against accused No.2 and\naccused No.3. Apart from the oral testimony of PW1 (the father of the\ndeceased) there is no other evidence on record to prove that the two\naccused Nos. 2-3 joined accused No.1 in harassing or cruelly treating the\ndeceased. On appreciation of the evidence the conclusion drawn by the High\nCourt in favour of accused No.2 and accused No.3 is reasonable and does not\njustify interference by us in their acquittal. Consequently, we uphold the\nacquittal of accused Nos. 2-3 and dismiss the two appeals preferred by the\nState of Andhra Pradesh which are filed to seek their conviction.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">We now take up for consideration Criminal Appeal No. 1457 of 1995,\npreferred by the parents of the deceased seeking conviction of accused No.1\nfor offence under <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_12\">section 304B</a> of the Indian Penal Code. In its common\nJudgment after appreciating the evidence on record, the conclusion reached\nby the High Court that the accused No. 1 cannot be convicted under <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_13\">section\n304B</a>, IPC appears to be legally sound. There is no evidence against accused\nNo. 1 that at the time of marriage there was any demand or settlement for\ngiving dowry in cash or by way of transfer of property. The father of the\ndeceased PW1 has not stated that cash, ornaments and the land were given at\nthe time of marriage pursuant to any demand of dowry by the parents of the\nhusband. He merely states that according to the custom of the community\ndeclaration was made of gift of five acres of land to the deceased as her\n&quot;Stridhana&quot; called in the community as pasunukumkuma. As promised and\ndeclared in the ritual at the time of marriage the land was transferred in\nthe name of the wife. The couple lived happily thereafter. It is only 2-3\nmonths thereafter that the husband started harassing the wife to force her\nto transfer the land to him. This harassment of cruel treatment to\npressurize her to transfer the land cannot be said to be &#x27;in connection\nwith any alleged dowry demand.&#x27; For the purpose of <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 304B</a>, IPC the\nlegislature has borrowed the definition of &#x27;dowry&#x27; from <a href=\"/doc/1249134/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 2</a> of the\nDowry Prohibition Act of 1961. The relevant provisions of the Penal Code,\nDowry Prohibition Act and Evidence Act are quoted hereunder:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">304-B.

To attract the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 304B</a> IPC, one\nof the main ingredients of the offence which is required to be established\nis that &quot;soon before her death&quot; she was subjected to cruelty and harassment\n&#x27;in connection with the demand for dowry&#x27;. There is no evidence on record\nto show that the land was demanded as dowry. It was given by the father to\nthe deceased in marriage ritual as pasupukumuma. The harassment or cruelty\nmeted out to the deceased by the husband after the marriage to force her to\ntransfer the land in his name was &#x27;not in connection with any demand for\ndowry.&#x27; One of the main ingredients of the offence of &quot;demand of dowry&quot;</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">being absent in this case, the High Court cannot be said to have committed\nany error in acquitting accused No. 1 for offence under <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 304B</a>, IPC.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">We however, find that the same evidence on record which was held reliable\nto convict accused No. 1 for offence of &#x27;cruelty&#x27; under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_25\">section 498A</a>, IPC,\nclearly makes out a case for his conviction for offence of abeting suicide\nunder <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 306</a>, IPC read with <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_27\">section 113 A </a>of the Evidence Act. Section\n498A makes cruelty by husband to wife as a punishable offence. The word\n&quot;cruelty&quot; is defined in the Explanation appended to the said Section.\nSection 498A with Explanation thereunder reads thus:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">Section 498A: &quot;Husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to\ncruelty-Whoever, being the husband or the relative of the husband of a\nwoman, subjects such woman to cruelty shall be punished with imprisonment\nfor a term which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to\nfine.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">Explanation - For the purpose of this section, &quot;cruelty&quot; means-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">(a) Any wilful conduct which is of such a nature as is likely to drive the\nwoman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or\nhealth (whether mental or physical) of the woman, or\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">(b) Harassment of the woman where such harassment is with a view to\ncoercing her or any person related to her to meet any unlawful demand for\nany property or valuable security or is on account of failure by her or any\nperson related to her to meet such demand.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_24\">[underlining for emphasis]\n\nClause (a) of the Explanation under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 498A</a>, IPC defines cruelty to\nmean a &#x27;wilful conduct of the husband of such nature as is likely to drive\nthe woman to commit suicide.&#x27; In the instant case, the accused pressurised\nand harassed the deceased to part with the land received by her from her\nfather as &quot;Stridhana.&quot; As a method adopted for harassment the Postal Mail\nof her relatives sent to her was suppressed by the husband who was in a\nposition to do so being a Branch Post Master in the village. When the\nletters were discovered by the wife and she handed them over to her father\n(PW1) she was driven out of the house. This cruel conduct of the husband\nled the wife to commit suicide. The trial court and the High Court were,\ntherefore, perfectly justified on this evidence to hold accused No. 1\nguilty of the offence of &#x27;cruelty&#x27; under Section 498A. As a result of such\ncruel treatment the wife was driven to commit suicide.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_25\">Thus offence of abetment of committing suicide punishable under <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_29\">Section\n306</a>, IPC is clearly made out against accused No. 1 and for that purpose\npresumption under <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 113 A </a>of the Evidence Act can be raised against\nhim. <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 306</a>, IPC reads thus:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">&quot;306. Abetment of suicide -If any person commits suicide, whoever abets the\ncommission of such suicide, shall be punished with imprisonment of either\ndescription for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be\nliable to fine.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\">113A. Presumption as to abetment of suicide by a married woman - When the\nquestion is whether the commission of suicide by a woman had been abetted\nby her husband or any relative of her husband and it is shown that she had\ncommitted suicide within a period of seven years from the date of her\nmarriage and that her husband or such relative of her husband had subjected\nher to cruelty, the Court may presume, having regard to all the other\ncircumstances of the case, that such suicide had been abetted by her\nhusband or by such relative or her husband.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_27\">Explanation - For the purposes of this section, &quot;cruelty; shall have the\nsame meaning as in <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_32\">section 498A</a> of the Indian Penal Code.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_28\">[emphasis applied]\n\nBoth the Courts below have found the husband guilty of cruel treatment of\nhis wife and as a result the wife committed suicide within seven years of\ntheir marriage. On such evidence the presumption which arises under <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_33\">Section\n113A</a> of the Evidence Act is that the husband abetted suicide. The word\n&quot;cruelty&quot; as mentioned in the Explanation below <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 113 A </a>of the\nEvidence Act has been given the same meaning as contained in the\nExplanation below <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 498A</a> IPC. On the facts found, &#x27;the wilful&#x27;\nconduct of the husband in forcing the deceased to part with her land which\nshe had received in marriage as &quot;stridhana&quot; and for that purpose concealing\nher postal mail was so cruel that she was driven to commit suicide. A case\nof conviction and sentence of accused No. 1 under <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 306</a>, IPC has thus\nclearly been made out even though his acquittal for commission of the\noffence of &#x27;dowry death&#x27; punishable under <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 304B</a>, IPC is not found\nliable to be disturbed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_29\">The learned counsel for the accused has argued that in the absence of a\ncharge framed against the accused under <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 306</a> IPC, the accused cannot\nbe convicted under the said Section.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_30\">From the record we find that although a charge specifically under <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_39\">Section\n306</a> IPC was not framed but all facts and ingredients constituting that\noffence were mentioned in the Statement of Charges framed under section\n498A and <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 304B</a> of IPC. The statement of charge framed by the trial\ncourts reads thus:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">&quot;That on or about the 22nd day of October, 1989, at your house at\nTunikipadu of Gampalagudem Mandal Yedla Krishna Kumari, wife of A-l of you\nand daughter-in-law of A2 and A-3 among you, committed suicide by consuming\npoison, and that you all subjected her to such cruelty and harassment as\ndid drive her to commit suicide, with the object of extracting Ac. 5-00 of\nland as dowry to A-l and thereby committed an offence punishable under\n<a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 304-B</a> of the Indian Penal Code and within the cognizance of this\nCourt.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">OR ALTERNATIVELY\n\nThat, prior to the 22nd day of October, 1989; at your house at Tunikipadu,\nyou subjected Yedla Krishna Kumari, wife of A-l among you and daughter-in-\nlaw of A-2 and A-3 among you, to such cruelty and harassment as did drive\nthe said Krishna Kumari to commit suicide, and thereby committed an offence\npunishable under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 498-A</a> of the Indian Penal Code and within the\ncognizance of this Court.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_31\">[emphasis applied]\n\nMere omission or defect in framing charge does not disable the Criminal\nCourt from convicting the accused for the offence which is found to have\nbeen proved on the evidence on record. The Code of Criminal procedure has\nample provisions to meet a situation like the one before us. From the\nStatement of Charge framed under Section 304B and in the alternative\n<a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 498A</a>, IPC (as quoted above) it is clear that all facts and\ningredients for framing charge for offence under <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 306</a>, IPC existed\nin the case. The mere omission on the part of the trial Judge to mention of\n<a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 306</a>, IPC with 498A, <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_46\">IPC</a> does not preclude the Court from convicting\nthe accused for the said offence when found proved. In the alternate charge\nframed under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 498A</a> of IPC, it has been clearly mentioned that the\naccused subjected the deceased to such cruelty and harassment as to drive\nher to commit suicide. The provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1096701/\" id=\"a_48\">Section 221</a> of Cr.P.C. take care\nof such a situation and safeguard the powers of the criminal court to\nconvict an accused for an offence with which he is not charged although on\nfacts found in evidence, he could have been charged for such offence.\nSection 221 of Cr. P.C. needs reproduction:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">&quot;221. Where it is doubtful what offence has been committed-(l)\n\nIf a single act or series of acts is of such a nature that it is doubtful\nwhich of several offences the facts which can be proved will constitute,\nthe accused may be charged with having committed all or any of such\noffences, and any number of such charges may be tried at once; or he may be\ncharged. In the alternative with having committed some one of the said\noffences.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">(2) If in such a case the accused is charged with one offence, and it\nappears in evidence that he committed a different offence for which he\nmight have been charged under the provisions of sub-section (12), he may be\nconvicted of the offence which he is shown to have committed, although he\nwas not charged with it.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_32\">The provision of sub-section (2) of Section 221 read with sub-section (1)\nof the said Section can be taken aid of in convicting and sentencing the\naccused No. 1 of offence of abetment of suicide under <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_49\">Section 306</a> of IPC\nalong with or instead of <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_50\">Section 498A</a> of IPC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_33\">Section 215 allows criminal court to ignore any error in stating either the\noffence or the particulars required to be stated in the charge, if the\naccused was not, in fact, misled by such error or omission in framing the\ncharge and it has not occasioned a failure of justice. See Section 215 of\nCr. P.C. which reads:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">&quot;215. Effect of errors - No error in stating, either the offence or the\nparticulars required to be stated in the charge, and no commission to state\nthe offence or those particulars, shall be regarded any stage of the case\nas material, unless the accused was in fact misled by such error or\nomission, and it has occasioned a failure of justice.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">As provided in <a href=\"/doc/588239/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 215</a> of Cr.P.C. commission to frame charge under\n<a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 306</a> IPC has not resulted in any failure of justice. We find no\nnecessity to remit the matter to the trial court for framing charge under\n<a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_53\">Section 306</a> IPC and direct a retrial for that charge. The accused cannot\nlegitimately complain of any want of opportunity to defend the charge under\n<a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_54\">Section 306</a>, IPC and a consequent failure of justice. The same facts found\nin evidence, which justify conviction of the appellant under Section 498A\nfor cruel treatment of his wife, make out a case against him under <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_55\">Section\n306</a> IPC of having abetted commission of suicide by the wife. The appellant\nwas charged for an offence of higher degree causing &quot;dowry death&quot; under\nSection 304B which is punishable with minimum sentence of seven years\nrigorous imprisonment and maximum for life. Presumption under <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_56\">Section 113A</a>\nof the Evidence Act could also be raised against him on same facts\nconstituting offence of cruelty under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_57\">Section 498A</a>, IPC. No further\nopportunity of defence is required to be granted to the appellant when he\nhad ample opportunity to meet the charge under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_58\">Section 498A</a>, IPC.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">It may be mentioned that against confirmation of this conviction by the\nHigh Court under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_59\">section 498A</a>, IPC, the accused No. 1 has not preferred any\nspecial leave to appeal to this Court. The facts found proved for his\nconviction and sentence under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_60\">Section 498A</a>, IPC, cannot now be questioned\nby the accused. Our conclusion, therefore, is that same facts and evidence\non which accused No. 1 was charged under Section 498A and Section 304B, the\naccused can be convicted and sentenced under <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_61\">Section 306</a> IPC. We find no\nlegal or procedural impediment in doing so.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">The legislature has by amending the Penal Code and Evidence Act made Penal\nLaw more strident for dealing with and punishing offences against married\nwomen. Such strident laws would have a deterrent effect on the offenders\nonly if they are so stringently implemented by the law courts to achieve\nthe legislative intent. On the facts found and the offence proved to have\nbeen committed leading to suicidal death of the wife, imprisonment of two\nyears with fine of Rs. 500 is too light a sentence. For offence under\n<a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_62\">Section 306</a> IPC the sentence may extend to ten years. In this case the\nhusband is found to have harassad his wife to such an extent as to drive\nher to commit suicide. Sentence of five years would, in our opinion, be a\nproper sentence for the crime with the amount of fine increased to Rs.\n20,000 to be paid as compensation to the parents of the deceased. On non-\npayment of fine the accused No. 1 shall suffer further sentence of one\nyear.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">We, thus, allow Criminal Appeal No. 1457 of 1995 preferred by the parents\nof the deceased. We maintain the conviction and sentence of accused No. 1\nunder <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_63\">Section 498A</a>, IPC. The accused No. 1 is also convicted under <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_64\">Section\n306</a>, IPC and sentenced to five years rigorous imprisonment with a fine of\nRs. 20,000 to be paid as compensation to the parents of the deceased. In\nthe event of non-payment of fine, accused No. 1 shall suffer imprisonment\nfor a further period of one year. The sentences imposed under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_65\">Section 498A</a>,\nIPC and under <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_66\">Section 306</a>, IPC shall run concurrently.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">Connected Criminal Appeal Nos. 1458-59 of 1985 preferred by the State\nagainst acquittal of accused Nos. 2 &amp; 3 are dismissed.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n",
