PW-1  was  informed\non 25.05.1991, by the  first  appellant-Vijay  Pal  Singh  through  his  son\nRakesh Singh that Saroj was found missing  from  the  intervening  night  of\n23/24th May, 1991. This information, PW-1  received  around  08.00  a.m.  on\n25.05.1991 and, thereafter, he lodged a complaint  at  the  Police  Station,\nJaspur. On the same day, PW-2-Samar Pal Singh,  Village  Pradhan,  lodged  a\nreport at Police  Station,  Dillari  stating  therein  that  one  Sukhe  had\ninformed him that he had seen a dead body  of  an  unknown  woman  in  burnt\ncondition in the forest area on the side of the road. Thereafter,  the  case\nwas registered under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 302</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/386021/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 201</a>  of  IPC.  PW-8-Ashok\nKumar was  entrusted  with  the  investigation.  The  usual  formalities  on\ninquest  etc.  were  undertaken  and  the  body  was  sent  for   postmortem\nexamination. PW-10-Dr. S. K. Arora conducted the  postmortem  on  26.05.1991\nat 04.40 p.m.\n\nRamesh Singh-father of the deceased, on 26.05.1991, lodged another  petition\nat Police Station, Dillari alleging that his daughter Saroj, aged about  20-\n22 years, had  got  married  on  10.02.1991  and  after  the  marriage,  his\ndaughter had gone back to her in-laws&#x27; house at  Kasampur,  Police  Station,\nJaspur, District Nainital with her husband Narendra  Singh  two  times,  and\nthe third time on 19.05.1991, his                son-in-law  Narendra  Singh\nhad come at 12 noon and had taken Saroj along with him at 04.00 p.m. It  was\nalleged that the appellants  were  continuously  making  dowry  demands  for\ntelevision, fridge and cooler and he had given them an assurance to  fulfill\nthe same, if given some time. But due to  his  weak  economic  position,  he\ncould not fulfill those  demands  immediately.  When  the  husband  came  to\nRamesh Singh&#x27;s house to take back his  daughter  Saroj  to  her  matrimonial\nhome for the second time, he was accompanied by his father Vijay Pal  Singh,\nhis younger brother-Rakesh Singh and  his  brother-in-law-Gyan  Chandra  and\nall of them had threatened him with dire consequences if the  dowry  demands\nwere not fulfilled. They also threatened to cause harm to her  in  case  the\ndowry demand was  not  fulfilled.  The  said  incident  took  place  in  the\npresence  of  the  family  members  of  PW-1-Ramesh  Singh,  people  in  the\nneighbourhood and some villagers also. It was further alleged that his  son-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_2\">in-law Narendra Singh went along with his daughter  on  the  assurance  that\ntheir dowry demands would be fulfilled. On 25.05.1991, at about 08.00  a.m.,\nRakesh Singh came to his house and told him  that  Saroj  had  been  missing\nsince the intervening night of 23/24th May, 1991.  Ramesh  Singh  thereafter\nwent to Kasampur and enquired about Saroj but could not get any  information\nabout her.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">On 26.05.1991, he came to know from the police that  they  had  recovered  a\npartly burnt dead body of  an  unknown  lady  from  the  forest  of  village\nSahaspuri on 25.05.1991  and  the  same  had  been  sent  to  Muradabad  for\npostmortem. On receiving such information, Ramesh Singh  reached  the  place\nof postmortem and, by seeing the dead  body  and  the  half  burnt  clothes,\nearrings, ring (anguthi), ring (challa) and bangles on  the  dead  body,  he\nidentified  the  dead  body  as  that  of  his  daughter  Saroj.  After  the\npostmortem, he took the dead body to Supardagi for cremation.  Ramesh  Singh\nalleged that his son-in-law Narendra Singh, father of  his  son-in-law-Vijay\nPal Singh, brother of his son-in-law-Rakesh Singh and brother-in-law of  his\nson-in-law, Gyan Chandra, had committed the murder  of  his  daughter  Saroj\nand had also tried to destroy  the  dead  body  by  burning  the  same  near\nvillage Sahaspuri. It was further alleged that Vijay Pal Singh  mislead  him\nby sending the missing information.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">In view of the above complaint, another FIR was registered on 26.05.1991  at\nPolice Station, Dillari and the investigation was  taken  over  by  Mahindra\nSingh Tyagi, Deputy Superintendent of Police-PW-9. As per his  report  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1187622/\" id=\"a_13\">Section  173(2)</a>  of  The  <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_14\">Code  of  Criminal  Procedure</a>,  1973  (hereinafter\nreferred  to  as  &quot;the  <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_15\">Cr.PC</a>.),  the  appellants  are  guilty  of  offences\npunishable under <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_16\">Sections 304B</a>, <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_17\">498A</a> and <a href=\"/doc/386021/\" id=\"a_18\">201</a> of IPC and <a href=\"/doc/751411/\" id=\"a_19\">Section  3</a>  /  <a href=\"/doc/1023340/\" id=\"a_20\">4</a>  of\nthe Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_5\">Charges of offences punishable under Section 304B read with  <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_21\">Section  34</a>  of\nIPC, Section 302 read with <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 34</a>  of  IPC,  <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_23\">Section  498A</a>  of  IPC  and\n<a href=\"/doc/386021/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 201</a> of IPC were framed against  the  appellants.

The oral and documentary evidence were put to each  of\nthem in question  form,  who  denied  the  allegations  made  against  them.\nHowever, no oral or documentary evidence  was  produced  by  them  in  their\ndefence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">The Additional Sessions Judge acquitted all the accused of all  the  charges\nmainly on two counts -  (i)  the  dead  body  was  not  in  an  identifiable\ncondition and (ii) there was  no  evidence  of  cruelty  or  harassment  for\ndowry.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\">The State filed an appeal under <a href=\"/doc/487026/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 378</a> of Cr.PC before the  High  Court\nwhich was disposed of by the impugned judgment dated  10.06.2010.  The  High\nCourt, after elaborately and minutely discussing the evidence, came  to  the\nfollowing conclusion at paragraph-33, which reads as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">&quot;33.  From the above said  facts  and  circumstances,  the  prosecution  has\nestablished its case beyond reasonable doubt against the  respondents  under\nSections 304-B r/w 34 of <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_27\">I.P.C</a>. and 498-A of <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_28\">IPC</a>. Besides above, it is  also\nnecessary to state here that P.W.-10 Dr. S.K. Arora who conducted the  post-\nmortem of the dead body of the deceased found two  ante-mortem  injuries  on\nthe body of the deceased, one on head and other on neck. He also found  burn\ninjuries on the body of the deceased  which  was  caused  after  the  death.\nUltimately, he opined that the deceased had died due to asphyxia  caused  by\nstrangulation.  Thus,  from  the  above  facts,  it  transpires   that   the\nrespondents/accused first committed  murder  of  Saroj  at  their  house  at\nVillage Kasampur by throttling her neck and thereafter in order  to  destroy\nthe evidence, they burnt the dead body and planted it on road in the  forest\nof village Sahaspuri at a distance of 35 Kms from Village Kasampur and  with\nintention to mislead  the  complainant  Ramesh  Singh,  they  sent  a  false\nmissing information  of  the  deceased  through  respondent/accused  Rakesh.\nThus, in this way,  the  respondents/accused  have  also  committed  offence\npunishable under <a href=\"/doc/386021/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 201</a> IPC.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\">On the basis of the above conclusion, the following finding was entered:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">&quot;34.  Therefore,  in  view  of  the  above-said  discussion,  I  am  of  the\nconsidered view that the trial  court  was  not  correct  and  justified  in\nacquitting the  respondents  for  the  offence  punishable  u/Ss  304-B  r/w\n<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 34</a> IPC, 498-A and 201  of  <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_31\">IPC</a>.  The  prosecution  has  successfully\nproved its case against  the  respondents/accused  beyond  reasonable  doubt\nunder the aforesaid sections and they are accordingly convicted.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_11\">On the basis of above finding, the following sentence was passed:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">&quot;35.  Accordingly, the  appeal  preferred  by  the  State  is  allowed.  The\njudgment and order dated  22.7.1995  passed  by  Third  Additional  Sessions\nJudge, Nainital, Camp Haldwani in Sessions Trial No. 281 of 1991, State  Vs.\nVijay Pal and others, is hereby set  aside.  The  respondents-accused  Vijay\nPal Singh, Narendra Singh, Rakesh and  Gyan  Chandra  are  hereby  convicted\nunder <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 304-B</a> IPC r/w <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 34</a> IPC and each of  them  are  sentenced\nto seven years&#x27; R.I. Each of them is further convicted  u/s  498-A  and  are\nsentenced to further two years&#x27; R.I. with fine of  Rs.2,000/-  each  and  in\ndefault, the defaulter shall undergo  further  six  months&#x27;  R.I.  They  are\nfurther convicted<a href=\"/doc/386021/\" id=\"a_34\"> u/s 201</a> IPC and each of them is sentenced  to  one  year&#x27;s\nR.I. All the sentences except that of fine shall run concurrently.  Let  the\nrespondents-accused be taken into custody forthwith in order  to  serve  out\nthe sentence as awarded against each of them. The period  already  undergone\nby the respondents-accused during the  period  of  investigation  and  trial\nshall be adjusted.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_12\">Learned Counsel appearing for the appellants, Mr. P.K.  Dey  submitted  that\nthis Court may not disturb the acquittal granted to the  appellants  by  the\ntrial court merely because a different view is possible.  It  was  contended\nthat the prosecution having miserably failed to  establish  the  ingredients\nof the offence under <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 304B</a> of IPC, the impugned  judgment  is  liable\nto be set aside. Mr. Dey, learned Counsel further contended that  the  trial\ncourt having acquitted the  appellants,  the  High  Court  should  not  have\ninterfered with the findings entered by the trial court which alone had  the\nopportunity to first appreciate the evidence while  recording  it.   It  was\nfurther contended that in any case, being an incident of  1991,  this  Court\nmay not sustain the sentence awarded to the appellants.  At  any  rate,  Mr.\nDey submitted that there is absolutely no evidence  so  as  to  connect  the\nthird and the fourth appellants who are the younger brother  of  the  second\nappellant, husband of the deceased and the brother-in-law,  husband  of  the\nsister of Narendra Singh. And the last contention of Mr.  Dey  is  that  the\nmatter should be remanded  to  the  High  Court  since  the  court  has  not\nfollowed the mandatory procedure under <a href=\"/doc/1604716/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 235</a> of Cr.PC, in having  been\ndenied an opportunity to the appellants to make submissions on sentence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_13\">Learned      Counsel      appearing      for      the      respondent-State,\nMr. Tanmaya Agarwal, however, contends that the findings of the trial  court\nbeing absolutely perverse, High Court is fully justified  in  reversing  the\nfinding and reaching a correct conclusion. According to the learned  Counsel\nfor the State, all the ingredients of Section 304B have  been  made  out  in\nthe present case and the punishments  awarded  to  all  the  appellants  are\nliable to the sustained.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">The postmortem report shows the following injuries on the body:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">&quot;i)   Lacerated wound 10 cm x 4 cm x skull deep on the occipital  region  of\nhead underneath occipital, left parietal, temporal bone fractured.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">ii)   Contusion semi-circular 20 cm x 3 cm on the front of  neck  underneath\nblood vessel lacerated and clotted blood present and cornua  of  hyoid  bone\nboth side fractured.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_15\">      One post-mortem injury  was  also  found  on  the  dead  body  of  the\ndeceased, which reads as under:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">i)    P.M burn whole of body including  both  extremities,  abdomen,  chest,\nface and back.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_16\">The cause of death, according to the postmortem report  is  asphyxia  caused\nby strangulation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_17\">It is rather strange that  the  High  Court  having  entered  a  finding  as\nextracted by us at paragraph-8 that it is a case of murder committed by  the\nappellants herein, declined to award appropriate  punishment  under  <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_37\">Section\n302</a> of IPC. It is a case where the appellants had faced trial under  <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_38\">Section\n302</a>  of  IPC  and,  therefore,  the  High  Court  could  have,  awarded   an\nappropriate punishment. The probable reasons why the High Court declined  to\ndo so, we shall discuss later.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_18\">Since, the victim in the case is a married woman and the death being  within\nseven years of  marriage,  apparently,  the  court  has  gone  only  on  one\ntangent, to treat the same as a dowry death.  No  doubt,  the  death  is  in\nunnatural circumstances but if there are definite indications of  the  death\nbeing homicide, the first approach of the prosecution and the  court  should\nbe to find out as to who caused that murder. <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 304B</a> of IPC  is  not  a\nsubstitute for <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 302</a> of IPC.  The  genesis  of  <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_41\">Section  304B</a>  of  IPC\nintroduced w.e.f. 19.11.1986 as per Act 43 of 1986 relates back to the  91st\nReport of the Law Commission of India. It is significant to  note  that  the\nsubject was taken up by the Law Commission suo motu.  Paragraph-1.3  of  the\nReport reads thus:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">&quot;1.3. If, in a particular incident of dowry death, the facts are such as  to\nsatisfy the legal ingredients of an offence already known to  the  law,  and\nif those facts can be proved without much difficulty, the existing  criminal\nlaw can be resorted to for bringing  the  offender  to  book.  In  practice,\nhowever, two main impediments arise-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">(i)   either the facts do not fully fit into the pigeon-hole  of  any  known\noffence; or\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">(ii)  the peculiarities of the situation are such  that  proof  of  directly\nincriminating facts is thereby rendered difficult.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">      The first impediment mentioned  above  is  aptly  illustrated  by  the\nsituation where a woman takes her life with her own  hands,  though  she  is\ndriven to it  by  ill-treatment.   This  situation  may  not  fit  into  any\nexisting pigeon-hole in the list  of  offences  recognized  by  the  general\ncriminal law of the  country,  except  where  there  is  definite  proof  of\ninstigation, encouragement or other conduct that amounts  to  &quot;abetment&quot;  of\nsuicide. Though, according to newspaper reports, there have  been  judgments\nof lower courts which seem to construe &quot;abetment&quot; in  this  context  widely,\nthe position is not beyond doubt.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">      The second situation  mentioned  above  finds  illustration  in  those\nincidents in which, even though the circumstances raise a  strong  suspicion\nthat the death was not accidental, yet, proof beyond  reasonable  doubt  may\nnot be forthcoming that the case was really one of homicide. Thus, there  is\nneed to address oneself to the substantive criminal law as well  as  to  the\nlaw of evidence.&quot;\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_21\">In the Statement of Objects and Reasons for the  Act  43  of  1986,  in  the\nBill, it is stated as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">&quot;<a href=\"/doc/1763444/\" id=\"a_42\">The  Dowry  Prohibition  Act,  1961</a>  was  recently  amended  by  the  Dowry\nProhibition (Amendment) Act, 1984 to give effect to certain  recommendations\nof the Joint Committee of the Houses of Parliament to examine  the  question\nof the  working  of  the  <a href=\"/doc/1763444/\" id=\"a_43\">Dowry  Prohibition  Act,  1961</a>  and  to  make  the\nprovisions of the Act more  stringent  and  effective.  Although  the  Dowry\nProhibition (Amendment)  Act,  1984  was  an  improvement  on  the  existing\nlegislation, opinions have been expressed by  representatives  from  women&#x27;s\nvoluntary organizations and others to the effect that  the  amendments  made\nare still inadequate and the Act needs to be further amended.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">2. It is, therefore, proposed to further amend the  <a href=\"/doc/1763444/\" id=\"a_44\">Dowry  Prohibition  Act,\n1961</a> to make provisions therein further stringent and effective. ...&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_22\">However, it is generally seen that in  cases  where  a  married  woman  dies\nwithin seven years of marriage, otherwise than under  normal  circumstances,\nno inquiry is usually conducted to see whether there is evidence, direct  or\ncircumstantial, as to whether the offence falls under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_45\">Section  302</a>  of  IPC.\nSometimes, <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 302</a> of IPC is put as an alternate charge. In cases  where\nthere is evidence, direct or circumstantial, to show that the offence  falls\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 302</a> of IPC, the trial court  should  frame  the  charge  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_48\">Section 302</a> of IPC even if the police has not expressed any opinion in  that\nregard in the report under <a href=\"/doc/461024/\" id=\"a_49\">Section 173(2)</a> of the Cr.PC. <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_50\">Section 304B</a> of  IPC\ncan be put as an alternate charge if  the  trial  court  so  feels.  In  the\ncourse of trial, if the court finds that there is  no  evidence,  direct  or\ncircumstantial, and proof  beyond  reasonable  doubt  is  not  available  to\nestablish that the same is  not  homicide,  in  such  a  situation,  if  the\ningredients under <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 304B</a> of IPC are available, the trial court  should\nproceed under the said provision. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1035633\" id=\"span_1\">In <a href=\"/doc/1035633/\" id=\"a_52\">Muthu Kutty and  another  v.  State  by\nInspector of Police, T.N.</a>[1], this Court addressed the  issue  and  held  as\nfollows:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">&quot;20. A reading  of  <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_53\">Section  304-B</a>  IPC  and  <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_54\">Section  113-B</a>,  Evidence  Act\ntogether makes it clear that law authorises a presumption that  the  husband\nor [pic]any other relative of the husband has caused the death  of  a  woman\nif she happens to die  in  circumstances  not  normal  and  that  there  was\nevidence to show that she was treated with cruelty or  harassed  before  her\ndeath in connection with any demand for dowry. It, therefore,  follows  that\nthe husband or the relative, as the case may be, need not be the  actual  or\ndirect participant in the commission of the  offence  of  death.  For  those\nthat are direct participants in the  commission  of  the  offence  of  death\nthere are already provisions incorporated in Sections 300, 302 and 304.  The\nprovisions contained in <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 304-B</a> IPC and <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_56\">Section 113-B</a> of the  Evidence\nAct were incorporated on the anvil  of  the  Dowry  Prohibition  (Amendment)\nAct, 1984, the main object of which is to curb the  evil  of  dowry  in  the\nsociety and to make it severely punitive in  nature  and  not  to  extricate\nhusbands or their relatives from the clutches of <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_57\">Section  302</a>  IPC  if  they\ndirectly cause death. This conceptual difference was not  kept  in  view  by\nthe courts below. But that cannot bring any  relief  if  the  conviction  is\naltered to Section 304 Part II. No  prejudice  is  caused  to  the  accused-\nappellants as they were originally  charged  for  offence  punishable  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_58\">Section 302</a> IPC along with <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_59\">Section 304-B</a> IPC.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"64642819\" id=\"span_2\">In a recent decision, this Court in <a href=\"/doc/64642819/\" id=\"a_60\">Jasvinder  Saini  and  others  v.  State\n(Government of NCT of Delhi</a>)[2], observed thus:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">&quot;15. It is common ground that a charge under <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_61\">Section  304-B</a>  IPC  is  not  a\nsubstitute for a charge of murder punishable under Section 302.  As  in  the\ncase of murder in every case under Section  304-B  also  there  is  a  death\ninvolved. The question whether it is murder  punishable  under  <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_62\">Section  302</a>\nIPC or a dowry death punishable under <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_63\">Section 304-B</a>  IPC  depends  upon  the\nfact situation and the evidence in the case. If there  is  evidence  whether\ndirect or circumstantial to prima facie support a charge under  <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_64\">Section  302</a>\nIPC the trial court can and  indeed  ought  to  frame  a  charge  of  murder\npunishable under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_65\">Section 302</a> IPC, which would then be the  main  charge  and\nnot an alternative charge as is erroneously assumed  in  some  quarters.  If\nthe main charge of murder is not proved against the accused  at  the  trial,\nthe court can look into the evidence to determine  whether  the  alternative\ncharge of dowry death punishable under Section  304-B  is  established.  The\ningredients constituting the two offences are different,  thereby  demanding\nappreciation of evidence from the perspective relevant to such  ingredients.\nThe trial court in that view of the matter acted mechanically for it  framed\nan additional  charge  under  <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_66\">Section  302</a>  IPC  without  adverting  to  the\nevidence adduced in the case and  simply  on  the  basis  of  the  direction\nissued in Rajbir case. The High Court no doubt made a  half-hearted  attempt\nto justify the framing of  the  charge  independent  of  the  directions  in\nRajbir case, but it would have been more appropriate  to  remit  the  matter\nback to the trial court for fresh orders rather than lending support  to  it\nin the manner done by the High Court.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_24\">Though in the instant case the accused were charged by  the  Sessions  Court\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_67\">Section 302</a> of IPC, it is seen that the trial court has not  made  any\nserious attempt to make an inquiry in that  regard.  If  there  is  evidence\navailable on homicide in a case of dowry  death,  it  is  the  duty  of  the\ninvestigating officer to investigate the case under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_68\">Section 302</a> of  IPC  and\nthe prosecution to proceed in that regard and  the  court  to  approach  the\ncase in that perspective. Merely because  the  victim  is  a  married  woman\nsuffering an unnatural death within seven years of  marriage  and  there  is\nevidence that she was subjected to  cruelty  or  harassment  on  account  of\ndemand for dowry, the prosecution and the court cannot  close  its  eyes  on\nthe culpable homicide and refrain from punishing its  author,  if  there  is\nevidence in that regard, direct or circumstantial.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_25\">In the instant case, the prosecution has not made  any  attempt  to  explain\nthe ante-mortem injuries which conclusively point to the cause of  death  as\nasphyxia caused by strangulation. Yet, no serious attempt, it is  disturbing\nto note, was done to connect the murder to its author(s).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">No doubt, nothing prevents this Court from putting the appellants on  notice\nas to why the punishment should not be appropriately  enhanced  but  why  we\nreluctantly decline to do so, we shall explain in  the  later  part  of  the\njudgment.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\">In two of the early decisions of  this  Court,  after  the  introduction  of\n<a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_69\">Section 304B</a> of IPC, the ingredients of the offence  and  the  interplay  of\n<a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_70\">Section 304B</a> of IPC with <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_71\">Sections 498A</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_72\">302</a>,  <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_73\">306</a>  of  IPC  have  also  been\ndiscussed. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"296025\" id=\"span_3\">In <a href=\"/doc/296025/\" id=\"a_74\">State of Punjab v. Iqbal Singh and  others</a>[3],  the  Court  in\nparagraph-8 stated that:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">&quot;8. ... The legislative intent is clear to curb the menace of dowry  deaths,\netc., with a firm hand. We must keep in mind  this  legislative  intent.  It\nmust be remembered that since crimes are generally committed in the  privacy\nof residential homes and in secrecy, independent and direct evidence is  not\neasy to get. That is why the legislature has by introducing  Sections  113-A\nand 113-B in the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_75\">Evidence Act</a> tried to strengthen the prosecution  hands  by\npermitting a presumption to be raised  if  certain  foundational  facts  are\nestablished and the unfortunate event has taken place within seven years  of\nmarriage. This period of seven years is considered to be the  turbulent  one\nafter which the legislature assumes that the couple would have settled  down\nin life. If a married women is subjected to cruelty  or  harassment  by  her\nhusband or his family members <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_76\">Section 498-A</a>,  IPC  would  be  attracted.  If\nsuch cruelty or harassment was inflicted by  the  husband  or  his  relative\nfor, or in connection with,  any  demand  for  dowry  immediately  preceding\ndeath by burns and bodily injury or in abnormal circumstances  within  seven\nyears of marriage, such husband or relative is deemed  to  have  caused  her\ndeath and is liable to be  punished  under  <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_77\">Section  304-B</a>,  IPC.  When  the\nquestion at issue is whether a person is guilty of dowry death  of  a  woman\nand the evidence  discloses  that  immediately  before  her  death  she  was\nsubjected by such person to cruelty and/or harassment for, or in  connection\nwith, any demand for dowry, <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_78\">Section 113-B</a>, Evidence Act  provides  that  the\ncourt shall presume that such person had caused the dowry death.  Of  course\nif there is proof of the person having intentionally caused her  death  that\nwould attract <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_79\">Section 302</a>, IPC. Then we have a situation where  the  husband\nor his relative by his wilful conduct creates a  situation  which  he  knows\nwill drive the woman to commit suicide and she actually does  so,  the  case\nwould squarely fall within the ambit of <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_80\">Section 306</a>, IPC.  In  such  a  case\nthe conduct of the person would tantamount to inciting or [pic]provoking  or\nvirtually pushing the woman into a desperate situation of  no  return  which\nwould compel her to put an end to her miseries by committing suicide. ...&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1036680\" id=\"span_4\">In <a href=\"/doc/1036680/\" id=\"a_81\">Smt.

State of Haryana</a>[4], which  is  seen  referred\nto in many of the subsequent decisions, this Court stated  the  law  on  the\npoint as follows:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">&quot;4.   ... A careful analysis of Section 304-B shows that  this  section  has\nthe following essentials:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">(1)   The death of a woman should be caused by burns  or  bodily  injury  or\notherwise than under normal circumstances;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_29\">[pic](2)    Such death should  have  occurred  within  seven  years  of  her\nmarriage;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_30\">(3)   She must have been subjected to cruelty or harassment by  her  husband\nor any relative of her husband;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\">(4)   Such cruelty or harassment should be for or in connection with  demand\nfor dowry.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_32\"><a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_82\">Section 113-B</a> of the Evidence Act lays down that if soon  before  the  death\nsuch woman has been subjected to cruelty or harassment for or in  connection\nwith any demand for dowry, then the court shall  presume  that  such  person\nhas committed the dowry death. The meaning of &quot;cruelty&quot; for the purposes  of\nthese sections has to be gathered from the language as found in Section 498-\nA and as per that section &quot;cruelty&quot; means &quot;any wilful conduct  which  is  of\nsuch a nature as is likely to drive the woman to commit suicide or to  cause\ngrave injury or danger to life etc. or  harassment  to  coerce  her  or  any\nother person related to her to meet any unlawful demand for any property  or\nvaluable security or is on account of failure by her or any  person  related\nto her to meet such demand&quot;. As per the definition of &quot;dowry&quot;  any  property\nor valuable security given or agreed to be given either at or before or  any\ntime after the marriage, comes within the meaning of &quot;dowry&quot;. ...&quot;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_33\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"163881331\" id=\"span_5\">Unto the latest decision available on  this  point,  in  <a href=\"/doc/163881331/\" id=\"a_83\">Baljinder  Kaur  v.\nState of Punjab</a>[5], except for the  required  thrust  with  respect  to  the\nfactual situation available in each case, the law has been consistent as  to\nthe requirements for constituting the offence under <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_84\">Section 304B</a> of IPC.\nBack to the facts of the instant case, the main evidence in this case is  of\nPW-1-Ramesh Singh, father of the  victim,  PWs-  5  and  6  -  who  are  the\nresidents of the village and PW-7-  husband  of  the  elder  sister  of  the\ndeceased, apart from the medical evidence.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_34\">According to PW-1, he had brought his daughter from her in-laws&#x27; house.  She\nhad told him about the demand from her in-laws&#x27; for the dowry. The  deceased\nhad gone to the in-laws&#x27; twice only and the third time when  the  son-in-law\nhad come to take his daughter, he was accompanied by  his  father-Vijay  Pal\nSingh, younger brother-Rakesh  Singh  and  brother-in-law-Gyan  Chandra  and\nthey had threatened him with dire consequences  in  case  their  demand  for\ntelevision, fridge and cooler was not met. PWs-5 and 6 are witnesses of  the\nsame.                                     PW-5-Dr.  Mushahid  Hussain  is  a\nregistered medical practitioner serving in the village  for  more  than  two\ndecades. According to him, the relatives of  the  husband  of  the  deceased\nSaroj and her father-in-law and other relations used to demand  more  dowry.\nHe had once used his good office to sort out the dispute. It has  also  come\nout from his evidence that once a Panchayat was  called  on  the  issue  and\neven in the Panchayat, in the presence of PW-5 himself, the husband and  his\nfather and others made demand for dowry. PW-6 is the  Gram  Pradhan  of  the\nGram Sabha, Alampur. He has also given evidence to  the  effect  that  there\nwere demands for more dowry from the in-laws&#x27;  of  deceased  Saroj.  He  has\nalso given evidence regarding the Panchayat held  to  sort  out  the  matter\nand, in his presence also, the in-laws&#x27; of deceased  Saroj  were  requesting\nfor more dowry. The other evidence is of PW-7- husband of the  elder  sister\nof the deceased. Only PW-1 and PW-7, the father and  husband  of  the  elder\nsister of the deceased, respectively, have  given  evidence  to  the  effect\nthat all the appellants had made the demand for more  dowry  and  had  posed\nthreat of consequences, if the demands were not met.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_35\">The death is within four months of the marriage. There  is  ample  evidence,\nwhich we have discussed above, to show  that  there  had  been  demands  for\ndowry. Then, the only ingredient to be established is  as  to  whether  soon\nprior to the death of deceased Saroj, whether  she  had  been  subjected  to\ncruelty or harassment on account of or in connection with demand for dowry.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\">Mr. Dey contends that even assuming that there is  evidence  on  demand  for\ndowry, there is absolutely no evidence to show that any demand was  made  to\nthe deceased Saroj. This contention  is  difficult  to  digest.  Demand  for\ndowry so as to come under the purview of Section 304B or Section  498A  need\nnot be to the married woman. The demand  can  as  well  be  to  the  father,\nmother, brother, etc., of the married woman. Any demand to them is  as  good\nas a demand to the married woman since she is the one to suffer in case  the\ndemands are not met, as has happened in the instant case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">Yet another serious contention raised by Mr. Dey is that in any case,  there\nis no evidence of cruelty  or  harassment  meted  out  to  the  deceased  on\naccount or in relation to the demand for dowry. Cruelty or  harassment  need\nnot always be demonstrated in the form of physical violence. The  fact  that\na married woman had to go out of her in-laws&#x27; house and  that  the  in-laws&#x27;\nhad made demand  for  dowry  as  a                        pre-condition  for\ntaking her back and that even a Panchayat was held at  the  local  level  to\nsort out the issue, are sufficient  indicators  of  cruelty  or  harassment,\nmental, if not, physical. Thus, all the ingredients of <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_85\">Section 304B</a>  of  IPC\nhave been established in the instant case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_38\">Incidentally,  we  shall  also  refer  to  one  contention   regarding   the\nidentification of the body. According to  the  learned  Counsel,  which  has\nbeen the  version  of  the  trial  court  as  well,  the  deceased  was  not\nidentified as Saroj, the wife of the  second  appellant-Narendra  Singh.  It\nappears, there has been slight confusion in the  mind  of  the  trial  court\nwith regard to recognition and identification. PW-2 and PW-3 first  saw  the\nbody and reported that the dead body was  of  an  unknown  person  and,  the\npeople who went to see the body, could not recognize as to  who  the  person\nwas. It has to be seen that PWs-2 and 3 were not from  the  village  of  the\ndeceased. Therefore, one  cannot  normally  expect  them  to  recognize  the\ndeceased person. That does not mean that the face of the dead  body  was  in\nsuch a shape that it had lost its shape. A bare look at  Exhibits-4  and  5-\nphotographs would show that to the people who knew the deceased, they  could\neasily recognize who the person was. Had the face been completely  burnt  or\notherwise lost its whole shape, it would not have been possible for  anybody\nto identify it, let alone recognize the person. In the instant  case,  PWs-2\nand 3 identified the face as that of a woman and PW-1-father has  recognized\nher to be his daughter. At the time of cremation, it has  come  in  evidence\nthat others also recognized the deceased as  Saroj,  daughter  of  PW-1  and\nwife of second appeallant-Narendra Singh.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"123218246\" id=\"span_6\">Learned Counsel appearing for the  appellants  strongly  canvassed  for  the\nposition that in  an  appeal  against  acquittal,  there  are  some  inbuilt\nrestrictions before the appellate  court  and  the  mere  possibility  of  a\ndifferent view is not enough to interfere with the  acquittal.

As  we  have  already  discussed\nherein above, the  conclusions  drawn  by  the  trial  court  is  apparently\nagainst the weight of evidence and thus perverse,  and  it  is  so  perverse\nthat no reasonable man could reach conclusions.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_40\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"761643\" id=\"span_15\">Now, the question as to why the High  Court,  having  entered  a  conclusion\nthat it is a case of murder at the hands of the  appellants,  yet  chose  to\nconvict them only under <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_95\">Section 304B</a> of IPC. As we have  already  indicated,\nit could have been a case for the High Court or for that matter  this  Court\nfor issuing notice for enhancement  of  punishment  to  those  against  whom\nthere is evidence to connect them with the murder.  The  incident  being  of\n1991, the prosecution having not chosen to link all the circumstances  in  a\nchain with no  missing  links  to  reach  the  irresistible  and  conclusive\nfinding on involvement of the accused, the High Court would have thought  it\nmore prudent to convict the accused only  under  <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_96\">Section  304B</a>  of  IPC.  No\ndoubt, in such a case, the High Court should not have  entered  a  categoric\nfinding  on  murder  since  once  the  court  enters  such  a  finding,  the\npunishment can only be under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_97\">Section  302</a>  of  IPC.  Having  regard  to  the\ncircumstances which we have <a href=\"/doc/761643/\" id=\"a_98\">referred to above</a>,  we  are  of  the  view  that\nthough this case could have been dealt with under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_99\">Section  302</a>  of  IPC,  at\nthis distance of time and in view of the lack of evidence on  the  chain  of\ncircumstances, it will not  be  proper  for  this  Court  to  proceed  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_100\">Section 302</a> of  IPC  for  enhancement  of  punishment.  There  are  no  such\nproblems as far  as  the  presumption  under  <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_101\">Section  113B</a>  of  the  Indian\nEvidence Act, 1872 is concerned. Once the ingredients  of  <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_102\">Section  304B</a>  of\nIPC are established, the presumption is that the death has  been  caused  by\nthe husband or his relatives, who caused the  cruelty  or  harassment.  That\npresumption can safely be drawn in the instant  case,  as  we  have  already\ndiscussed above, as all the ingredients under <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_103\">Section 304B</a> of IPC have  been\nproved beyond doubt in the present  case  particularly  since  there  is  no\ndirect evidence on the part of the appellants to rebut the same.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"295339\" id=\"span_16\">Yet with all that,  we  have  to  address  a  further  question  as  to  the\ninvolvement of the younger brother of husband-Rakesh Singh  and  brother-in-\nlaw  of  husband-Gyan  Chandra.  Though,  under  <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_104\">Section  304B</a>  of  IPC,   a\npresumption has to be drawn against those relatives who  have  harassed  the\ndeceased in connection with the demand for dowry, there  must  be  evidence,\nwhich is not rebutted to connect the  husband  and  each  relative  in  that\nregard. Rebuttal can be made even without direct evidence  (See  Kundan  Lal\nRallaram v. The  Custodian,  Evacuee  Property  Bombay[15]  followed  in  <a href=\"/doc/295339/\" id=\"a_105\">M.\nNarsinga Rao v. State of Andhra Pradesh</a>[16]).</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_42\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1088629\" id=\"span_17\">In <a href=\"/doc/1088629/\" id=\"a_106\">Alamgir Sani v. State of Assam</a>[17], one of the issues that  came  up  for\nconsideration before this Court on acquittal under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_107\">Section  302</a>  of  IPC  is\nwhether on account of acquittal under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_108\">Section 302</a> of IPC, the accused  could\nclaim acquittal under <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_109\">Section 304B</a> of IPC. It was clarified  by  this  Court\nthat the acquittal under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_110\">Section 302</a> of  IPC  will  not  lead  to  automatic\nacquittal under <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_111\">Section 304B</a> of IPC. Even if an accused is  acquitted  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_112\">Section 302</a> of IPC, if there is evidence available  so  as  to  satisfy  the\ningredients of <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_113\">Section 304B</a> of IPC,  the  accused  can  still  be  convicted\nunder <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_114\">Section 304B</a> of IPC, in case there is no rebuttal  of  presumption  on\nthe death as caused by the accused. To quote:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">&quot;15. We also see no substance in the  submission  that  merely  because  the\nappellant had been acquitted under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_115\">Section 302</a>  IPC  the  presumption  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_116\">Section 113-B</a> of the Evidence Act stands automatically rebutted.  The  death\nhaving taken place within seven  years  of  the  marriage  and  there  being\nsufficient evidence of demand of dowry, the presumption under <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_117\">Section  113-B</a>\nof the Evidence Act gets invoked. There is no evidence in rebuttal.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_43\">Though PW-1-father of the deceased and PW-7- husband of the elder sister  of\nthe deceased have stated that Rakesh Singh and Gyan Chandra were  also  with\nVijay Pal Singh  and  Narendra  Singh-husband  of  the  deceased  when  they\nvisited his house and demanded dowry and posed a threat, but it has come  in\nthe evidence of PW-5 and  PW-6  that  in  the  family  of  in-laws&#x27;  of  the\ndeceased Saroj, they did not recognize any person other than the  father-in-\nlaw-Vijay Pal Singh and husband-Narendra Singh. Not only that  it  has  come\nout in evidence of PW-1 himself that younger brother-Rakesh Singh  had  been\nstudying elsewhere and that the  brother-in-law  Gyan  Chandra  was  from  a\ndifferent village.   Since  the  independent  witnesses  PWs-5  and  6  have\nrecognized only the father-in-law and husband of the  deceased,  we  are  of\nthe view that it will not be safe to conclude  the  offence  under  <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_118\">Sections\n304B</a> of IPC, 498A of <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_119\">IPC</a> or 201 of <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_120\">IPC</a> as proved against  Rakesh  Singh  and\nGyan Chandra. Therefore,  the  conviction  and  sentence  as  against  third\naccused/appellant-Rakesh Singh  and  fourth  accused/appellant-Gyan  Chandra\nare set aside.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_44\">Now, the last question as to whether the case should  be  remitted  back  to\nthe High Court for the purpose of <a href=\"/doc/1604716/\" id=\"a_121\">Section 235</a> of Cr.PC, we are of  the  view\nthat in the present case, it is  not  necessary.  The  conviction  is  under\n<a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_122\">Section 304B</a> IPC. The  mandatory  minimum  punishment  is  seven  years.  Of\ncourse, there is no such minimum punishment under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_123\">Section  498A</a>  of  IPC  or\n<a href=\"/doc/386021/\" id=\"a_124\">Section 201</a> of IPC. Since the sentence in respect of offence  under  <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_125\">Section\n498A</a> of IPC for two years rigorous imprisonment and one year  under  <a href=\"/doc/386021/\" id=\"a_126\">Section\n201</a> of IPC are to run concurrently, no prejudice  whatsoever  is  caused  to\nthe two appellants. Therefore, this is not a  fit  case  for  following  the\nprocedure under <a href=\"/doc/1604716/\" id=\"a_127\">Section 235</a> of Cr.PC by this Court or  for  remand  in  that\nregard to the High Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_45\">The   conviction   and   sentence   against    the    third    and    fourth\naccused/appellants, Rakesh Singh and Gyan  Chandra,  respectively,  are  set\naside. The conviction and sentence as against first and  second  appellants,\nVijay Pal Singh and Narendra Singh, respectively, under <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_128\">Section 304B</a> of  IPC\nread with <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_129\">Section 34</a> of IPC, <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_130\">Section 498A</a> of IPC and <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_131\">Section 201of</a>  IPC  are\nupheld.  Their  bail   bonds   are   cancelled.   They   shall   immediately\nsurrender/they shall be taken to custody, to serve the  remaining  sentence.\nThe appeal is thus partly allowed as above.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_46\">                                ..........................................J.\n                                  (KURIAN JOSEPH)\n\n\n\n                                ..........................................J.\n       (ABHAY MANOHAR SAPRE)\nNew Delhi;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_47\">December 16, 2014.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_48\">-----------------------</p><pre id=\"pre_2\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">[1]</span>\n\n       (2005) 9 SCC 113\n[2]    (2013) 7 SCC 256\n[3]    (1991) 3 SCC 1\n[4]    (1991) 1 SCC 371\n[5]    (2014) 13 SCALE 96\n[6]    (2014) 5 SCC 154\n[7]    (2008) 1 SCC 258\n[8]    (2006) 1 SCC 401\n[9]    (2002) 10 SCC 461\n[10]   (2006) 10 SCC 313\n[11]   (1996) 9 SCC 225\n[12]   (2010) 12 SCC 59\n[13]   (2003) 11 SCC 271\n[14]   (2007) 4 SCC 415\n[15]   AIR 1961 SC 1316\n[16]   (2001) 1 SCC 691\n[17]   (2002) 10 SCC 277\n\n-----------------------\n                                                                  REPORTABLE\n\n\n-----------------------\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">28</span>\n\n\n</pre>",
