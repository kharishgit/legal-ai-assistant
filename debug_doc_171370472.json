Factual matrix\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_11\">6.         Before dealing with the questions raised before us, it is\nnecessary to briefly note some essential facts of the case.              The\nappellant Smt. Dayawati (&quot;complainant&quot; hereafter) filed a complaint\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act, complaining that the respondent Shri\nYogesh Kumar Gosain herein (&quot;respondent&quot; hereafter) had a liability\nof `55,99,600/- towards her as on 7th April, 2013 as recorded in a\nregular ledger account for supply of fire-fighting goods and equipment\nto the respondent on different dates and different quantities. In part\ndischarge of this liability, the respondent was stated to have issued two\naccount payee cheques in favour of the complainants of `11,00,000/-\n(Cheque No.365406/- dated 1st December, 2014) and `16,00,000/-\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">Crl.Ref.No.1/2016                                         Page 5 of 89</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\"> (Cheque No.563707 dated 28th November, 2014).            Unfortunately,\nthese two cheques were dishonoured by the respondent&#x27;s bank on\npresentation on account of &quot;insufficiency of funds&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_13\">7.      As a result, the complainant was compelled to serve a legal\nnotice of demand on the respondent which, when went unheeded, led\nto the filing of two complaint cases under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act\nbefore the Patiala House Courts, New Delhi being CC Nos.89/1/15\nand 266/1/15. In these proceedings, both parties had expressed the\nintention to amicably settle their disputes. Consequently, by a\ncommon order dated 1st April, 2015 recorded in both the complaint\ncases, the matter was referred for mediation to the Delhi High Court\nMediation and Conciliation Centre.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">8.      We extract hereunder the operative part of the order dated 1 st\nApril, 2015 which reads as follows :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">        &quot;... Ld. Counsel for accused submits that accused is willing\n        to explore the possibilities of compromise. Ld. Counsel for\n        complainant is also interested (sic) in compromise talk. Let\n        the matter be referred to Mediation Cell, High Court Delhi,\n        Delhi.

It appears that after negotiations at the Delhi High Court\nMediation and Conciliation Centre, the parties settled their disputes\nunder a common settlement agreement dated 14th May, 2015 under\nwhich the accused agreed to pay a total sum of `55,54,600/- to the\ncomplainant as full and final settlement amount in installments with\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">Crl.Ref.No.1/2016                                      Page 6 of 89</span>\n regard to which a mutually agreed payment schedule was drawn up. It\nwas undertaken that the complainant would withdraw the complaint\ncases after receipt of the entire amount. In the agreement drawn up,\nthe parties agreed to comply with the terms of the settlement which\nwas signed by both the parties along with their respective counsels.\nWe extract the essential terms of the settlement hereunder :\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_16\">        &quot;xxx                    xxx                        xxx\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_17\">        6.

This settlement agreement was placed before the court on 1st\nJune, 2015 when the following order was recorded :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">        &quot;File received back from the Mediation Centre with report\n        of settlement.

Unfortunately, the accused/respondent herein failed to comply\nwith the terms of the settlement. Though vested with the obligation\nthereunder to pay a sum of `11,00,000/- as the first installment on 25th\nJune, 2015, he paid only a sum of `5,00,000/- to the complainant\nthrough RTGS without giving any justification. On the 30th June of\n2015, the Metropolitan Magistrate consequently recorded thus:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">        &quot;... Ld. Counsel for complainant submits that the accused\n        has not made the payment of first installment in terms of\n        mediation settlement dated 14.05.2015.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">               Ld. Counsel for complainant further submits that\n        accused was to pay first installment of Rs. 11,00,000/- on or\n        before the 25.06.2015 however he has paid only Rs.\n        5,00,000/- through RTGS. No reasonable explanation for\n        the non-payment of full amount of first installment is given\n        by the accused. Further, no assurance is given by the\n        accused for making of the due installments within the\n        stipulated time.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">              Considering the facts of the case and submissions on\n        behalf of both the parties, it is apparent that the accused is\n        not willing to comply with the terms and conditions of the\n        mediation settlement. Hence, mediation settlement failed.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">Crl.Ref.No.1/2016                                       Page 8 of 89</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">               Let the matter be proceeded on merit, put up on\n        14.08.2015&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_24\">                             (Emphasis by us)\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_25\">12.     Thereafter, two more opportunities were given by the\nMetropolitan Magistrate on 14th August, 2015 and 21st August, 2015\nto the accused to comply with the settlement. Finally, in view of the\ncontinued non-compliance, the matter was listed for framing of notice\non 28th September, 2015 and trial on merits.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_26\">13.     In the meantime, the Negotiable Instruments (Amendment)\nOrdinance, 2015, received the assent of the President of India on the\n26th of December, 2016. On account of promulgation of the ordinance,\n<a href=\"/doc/595945/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 142</a> of the Negotiable Instuments Act, 1881 stood amended\nwith regard to jurisdiction of offences under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 138</a> of the\nenactment and therefore these cases stood transferred from Patiala\nHouse Courts to Tis Hazari Courts at which stage the matter came to\nbe placed before the ld. referral judge.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_27\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"124582566\" id=\"span_9\">14.     At this stage, an application dated 16th November, 2015 was\nfiled by the complainant seeking enforcement of the settlement\nagreement dated 14th May, 2015 placing reliance on the judicial\nprecedents reported at 2013 SCC OnLine Del 124 Hardeep Bajaj v.\nICICI; 2015 SCC OnLine Del 7309 Manoj Chandak v. M/s Tour\nLovers Tourism (India) Pvt Ltd and 2015 SCC OnLine Del 9334 M/s\n<a href=\"/doc/124582566/\" id=\"a_20\">Arun International v. State of Delhi</a>. The complainant urged that the\nsettlement agreement was arrived at after long negotiations and\nmeetings; that it was never repudiated by the accused nor challenged\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">Crl.Ref.No.1/2016                                    Page 9 of 89</span>\n on grounds of it being vitiated for lack of free consent or any other\nground and lastly, that the accused having paid part of the first agreed\ninstallment, has also acted upon the mediation settlement and cannot\nbe allowed to wriggle free of his obligation under the same.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_28\">15.     The respondent, on the other hand, argued that the settlement\nagreement was not binding contending primarily, for the first time,\nthat the settlement amount was exorbitant and onerous pointing out\nthat the complaints were filed with regard to two cheques which were\nfor a cumulative amount of `27,00,000/- while the settlement amount\nwas of `55,54,600/- and this by itself was evidence that the agreement\nwas unfair, arbitrary and not binding on the accused. It was further\nurged that on receipt of the case from the mediation cell, the statement\nof the parties ought to have been recorded before the court whereby\nthe parties would have adopted the mediation settlement agreement so\nthat the same bore the imprimatur of the court. As per the respondent,\nabsence of such statement in the case denuded the settlement\nagreement of its binding nature and efficacy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_29\">16.     The ld.

Let us, first and foremost, briefly examine the genesis, modes\nand methods of dispute resolution available to disputants.            It is\ncommon knowledge that other than the traditional adversarial\nlitigation before courts, alternate dispute resolution mechanisms found\nas being increasingly suited for various classes of cases, stand given\nstatutory recognition and have received judicial recommendation as\nwell.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_32\">18.     The legislature has increasingly awarded statutory recognition\nand provided for alternate dispute resolution mechanisms to parties in\nseveral enactments, some completely dedicated to this process. These\ninclude lok adalats (<a href=\"/doc/17104795/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 19</a> of the Legal Services Authorities Act,\n1987); arbitration and conciliation (Parts I &amp; III of Arbitration and\nConciliation Act, 1996 as well as <a href=\"/doc/1147393/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 89(a)</a> &amp; (b) <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_26\">of the Code of\nCivil Procedure</a>, 1908 incorporated on 1st of July 2002); judicial\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">Crl.Ref.No.1/2016                                     Page 11 of 89</span>\n settlement and mediation (<a href=\"/doc/1147393/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 89(c)</a> &amp; (d) <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_28\">of the Code of Civil\nProcedure</a>).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_33\">19.

Union of India</a> (commonly known as\nSalem Bar I). So far as the amendments and insertion of <a href=\"/doc/66488754/\" id=\"a_77\">Section 89</a> of\nthe Code of Civil Procedure was concerned, the Supreme Court\nobserved that <a href=\"/doc/1147393/\" id=\"a_78\">Section 89</a> was a new provision and even through\narbitration or conciliation had been in place as modes of settling the\ndisputes, this had not really reduced the burden of the courts. The\ncourt was of the view that modalities had to be formulated for the\nmanner in which <a href=\"/doc/1147393/\" id=\"a_79\">Section 89</a> as well as other provisions which had\nbeen introduced by way of amendments, may have to be operated. For\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">Crl.Ref.No.1/2016                                     Page 28 of 89</span>\n this purpose, a Committee was constituted to ensure that the\namendments made became effective and resulted in quicker\ndispensation of justice.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_80\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"342197\" id=\"span_33\">35.      This was followed by a later pronouncement in the same case\nreported at (<a href=\"/doc/342197/\" id=\"a_80\">2005) 6 SCC 344, Salem Advocate Bar Assn. v. Union Of\nIndia</a> (commonly referred to as Salem Bar II), whereby the Supreme\nCourt further clarified the position holding as follows :</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_83\">      &quot;57. A doubt has been expressed in relation to clause (d) of\n      <a href=\"/doc/24012704/\" id=\"a_81\">Section 89(2)</a> of the Code on the question as to finalisation of the\n      terms of the compromise. The question is whether the terms of\n      compromise are to be finalised by or before the mediator or by\n      or before the court. It is evident that all the four alternatives,\n      namely, arbitration, conciliation, judicial settlement including\n      settlement through the Lok Adalat and mediation are meant to be\n      the action of persons or institutions outside the court and not\n      before the court. Order 10 Rule 1-C speaks of the &quot;Conciliation\n      Forum&quot; referring back the dispute to the court. In fact, the court\n      is not involved in the actual mediation/conciliation. Clause (d)\n      of <a href=\"/doc/24012704/\" id=\"a_82\">Section 89(2)</a> only means that when mediation succeeds and\n      parties agree to the terms of settlement, the mediator will report\n      to the court and the court, after giving notice and hearing to the\n      parties, &quot;effect&quot; the compromise and pass a decree in\n      accordance with the terms of settlement accepted by the parties.\n      Further, in this view, there is no question of the court which\n      refers the matter to mediation/conciliation being debarred from\n      hearing the matter where settlement is not arrived at. The judge\n      who makes the reference only considers the limited question as to\n      whether there are reasonable grounds to expect that there will be\n      a settlement, and on that ground he cannot be treated to be\n      disqualified to try the suit afterwards, if no settlement is arrived\n      at between the parties.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_84\">          xxx                        xxx                      xxx\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_85\">      62. When the parties come to a settlement upon a reference\n      made by the court for mediation, as suggested by the Committee\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">Crl.Ref.No.1/2016                                         Page 29 of 89</span>\n       that there has to be some public record of the manner in which\n      the suit is disposed of and, therefore, the court has to first\n      record the settlement and pass a decree in terms thereof and if\n      necessary proceed to execute it in accordance with law. It\n      cannot be accepted that such a procedure would be unnecessary.\n      If the settlement is not filed in the court for the purpose of\n      passing of a decree, there will be no public record of the\n      settlement. It is, however, a different matter if the parties do not\n      want the court to record a settlement and pass a decree and feel\n      that the settlement can be implemented even without a decree.\n      In such eventuality, nothing prevents them in informing the\n      court that the suit may be dismissed as a dispute has been\n      settled between the parties outside the court.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_81\">                              (Emphasis by us)\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_82\">36.      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1678821\" id=\"span_35\">In (<a href=\"/doc/1678821/\" id=\"a_83\">2010) 8 SCC 24, Afcons Infrastructure Ltd. &amp; Anr. v.\nCherian Varkey Constructions Co.

Certain\nerrors by the draftsman were noted in <a href=\"/doc/66488754/\" id=\"a_85\">Section 89</a> of the CPC. In this\njudgment, the court further interpreted the statute to implement the\nspirit, object and intendment of the provisions.

In view of the foregoing, it has to be concluded\n         that proper interpretation of <a href=\"/doc/1147393/\" id=\"a_86\">Section 89</a> of the Code\n         requires two changes from a plain and literal reading of\n         the section. Firstly, it is not necessary for the court, before\n         referring the parties to an ADR process to formulate or\n         reformulate the terms of a possible settlement. It is\n         sufficient if the court merely describes the nature of\n         dispute (in a sentence or two) and makes the reference.\n         Secondly, the definitions of &quot;judicial settlement&quot; and\n         &quot;mediation&quot; in clauses (c) and (d) of <a href=\"/doc/24012704/\" id=\"a_87\">Section 89(2)</a> shall\n         have to be interchanged to correct the draftsman&#x27;s error.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">Crl.Ref.No.1/2016                                         Page 30 of 89</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_87\">         Clauses (c) and (d) of <a href=\"/doc/24012704/\" id=\"a_88\">Section 89(2)</a> of the Code will read\n        as under when the two terms are interchanged:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_88\">        (c) for &quot;mediation&quot;, the court shall refer the same to a\n        suitable institution or person and such institution or\n        person shall be deemed to be a Lok Adalat and all the\n        provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/26738839/\" id=\"a_89\">Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987</a> (39\n        of 1987) shall apply as if the dispute were referred to a\n        Lok Adalat under the provisions of that Act;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_89\">        (d) for &quot;judicial settlement&quot;, the court shall effect a\n        compromise between the parties and shall follow such\n        procedure as may be prescribed.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_83\">        The above changes made by interpretative process shall\n        remain in force till the legislature corrects the mistakes,\n        so that <a href=\"/doc/1147393/\" id=\"a_90\">Section 89</a> is not rendered meaningless and\n        infructuous.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_84\">                           (Emphasis supplied)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_85\">37.     With regard to anomalies in <a href=\"/doc/66488754/\" id=\"a_91\">Section 89</a> of the CPC, the\nSupreme Court has thus held that where the court has referred the\nmatter to mediation, the mediator shall be deemed to be a Lok Adalat\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/26738839/\" id=\"a_92\">Legal Services Act</a>. For cases covered under <a href=\"/doc/66488754/\" id=\"a_93\">Section 89</a> of\nthe CPC, it is thus abundantly clear that the mediated settlement and\nsettlement before &quot;another Judge&quot;, would have the same efficacy and\nbinding status as an award of the Lok Adalat which is deemed to be a\ndecree.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_86\">38.     The Supreme Court has also stipulated that mediated settlement\nwould have to be placed before the courts concerned for recording of\nthe settlement and disposal of the case.

If it finds that the case falls under any excluded\n        category, it should record a brief order referring to the\n        nature of the case and why it is not fit for reference to ADR\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">Crl.Ref.No.1/2016                                       Page 32 of 89</span>\n         processes.

The parties\n        should also be informed that the cost of arbitration will\n        have to be borne by them.

We have found that, though <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_120\">the Code of Civil Procedure</a>\ncontains a specific provision in <a href=\"/doc/66488754/\" id=\"a_121\">Section 89</a> of the C.P.C. enabling\nreference of matters to alternate dispute redressal, however, so far as\ncriminal cases are concerned, it is amply clear that the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_122\">Code of\nCriminal Procedure</a> does not contain any express statutory provision\nenabling the criminal court to refer the parties to a forum for alternate\ndispute resolution including mediation.      The same is the position\nregarding cases under the <a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_123\">NI Act</a>. Therefore, the question which first\nbegs an answer is whether the criminal court can in any manner refer\nparties before it to dispute resolution by mediation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_116\">51.     In para 18 of Afcons, the Supreme Court has given illustrations\nof certain categories of cases that were normally not considered\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">Crl.Ref.No.1/2016                                       Page 38 of 89</span>\n suitable for alternate dispute resolution processes. Prosecution for\ncriminal offences has been mentioned as not suitable. The judgment\nalso notes that the categorization enumerated is merely illustrative and\nnot inflexible.     As the legal validity of mediation in criminal\ncompoundable cases was not specifically in question, there is thus no\nauthoritative judicial pronouncement prohibiting the same.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_117\">52.      Out of the alternate dispute redressal mechanisms adopted by\nthis country&#x27;s legal system, the mediation movement as a reliable\nmechanism, has gained both acceptability and popularity. In an article\ntitled     &quot;Mediation    :   Constituents,   Process      and          Merit&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_104\">(http://gujarathighcourt.nic.in/mediation/sbs1.htm) authored by S.B.\nSinha, J. (Retd. Judge of the Supreme Court of India), it has been\nnoted that unlike litigation and arbitration, which consists of formal\nevidentiary hearings and a final adjudication, mediation was a semi-\nformal negotiation aimed at allowing parties to settle disputes, not\nonly amicably but also economically and expeditiously by a process of\nself and participatory determination. It is noted that mediation as a\nmethod of dispute resolution was not a unique or new concept and that\nit had in fact evolved through long standing traditions, was being used\nby tribes and villages across our country long before it came to be\nstatutorily recognized in the recent past. The roots of mediation have\nbeen traced back to texts such as &quot;Kautilya&#x27;s Arthashastra&quot; as well as\nthe Panchayati Raj system.        The references to Lord Krishna&#x27;s\nmediation between Kauravas and Pandavas during the Mahabharata\nare legendary.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">Crl.Ref.No.1/2016                                      Page 39 of 89</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_118\"> 53.     Mediation undoubtedly provides an efficient, effective, speedy,\nconvenient and inexpensive process to resolve disputes with dignity,\nmutuality, respect and civility where parties participate in arriving at a\nnegotiated settlement rather than being confronted with a third party\nadjudication of their disputes. The very fact that it enables warring\nparties to sit across the table and negotiate, even if unsuccessful in\ndispute resolution, undergoing the process creates an atmosphere of\nharmony and peace in which parties learn to &#x27;agree to disagree&#x27;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_119\">54.     The examination of the statutory regime and the practice\ngoverning mediation shows that the genesis of the mediation may rest\non a court referral whereby the court refers the parties in a pending\ncase, with their consent, to mediation. However, the availability of\nmediation as a platform to negotiate a settlement does not rest on a\ncourt referral. The parties are enabled to approach the mediation\ncentre or the mediator even without the court order in what is referred\nto as &#x27;pre-litigation mediation&#x27; which is really an effort to resolve the\ndispute before filing a case to explore the possibility of dispute\nresolution without court intervention. Inasmuch as we are not\nconcerned with the consequences of a settlement in a pre-litigation\nmediation or the manner of its enforceability, we do not propose to\ndwell on it in this judgment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_120\">55.     Mr. J.P. Sengh, Senior Advocate would emphasize before us\nthat it is the parties who are referred to the mediation, and, not the lis\nbefore the court. It is contended that the power to refer parties to\nmediation is irrespective of the nature of the case before the court, and\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">Crl.Ref.No.1/2016                                       Page 40 of 89</span>\n that it could be civil or criminal. We find that inasmuch as it is the\nparties who are referred to mediation, this would be the correct legal\nposition.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_121\">56.     We have extracted above the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/91933/\" id=\"a_124\">Section 320</a> of the\nCr.P.C. <a href=\"/doc/91933/\" id=\"a_125\">Section 320</a> of the Cr.P.C. enumerates and draws a distinction\nbetween offences as compoundable, either between the parties or with\nthe leave of the court. This provision clearly permits and recognizes\nthe settlement of specified criminal offences. Settlement of the issue(s)\nis inherent in this provision envisaging compounding. The settlement\ncan obviously be only by a voluntary process inter se the parties. To\nfacilitate this process, there can be no possible exclusion of external\nthird party assistance to the parties, say that of neutral mediators or\nconciliators.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_122\">57.     Therefore, even though an express statutory provision enabling\nthe criminal court to refer the complainant and accused persons to\nalternate dispute redressal mechanisms has not been specifically\nprovided by the Legislature, however, the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_126\">Cr.P.C</a>. does permit and\nrecognize settlement without stipulating or restricting the process by\nwhich it may be reached. There is thus no bar to utilizing the alternate\ndispute mechanisms including arbitration, mediation, conciliation\n(recognized under Section 89 of CPC) for the purposes of settling\ndisputes which are the subject matter of offences covered under\nSection 320 of the Cr.P.C.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">Crl.Ref.No.1/2016                                      Page 41 of 89</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_123\"> VII. Process to be followed in reference of above disputes in\n     criminal law to mediation\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_124\">58.     So what is the process to be followed in disputes under criminal\nlaw? So far as criminal matters are concerned, <a href=\"/doc/1231086/\" id=\"a_127\">Section 477</a> of the\nCr.P.C. enables the High Court to make rules regarding any other\nmatter which is required to be prescribed.         The Mediation and\nConciliation Rules stand notified by the Delhi High Court in exercise\nof the rule making power under Part X <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_128\">of the Code of Civil Procedure</a>,\n<a href=\"/doc/183488277/\" id=\"a_129\">Section 89(2)(d)</a> of the C.P.C. as well as &quot;all other powers enabling\nthe High Court&quot; in this behalf. The Rules therefore, clearly provide\nfor mediation not only in civil suits, but also to &quot;proceeding pending\nin the High Court of Delhi or in any court subordinate to the High\nCourt of Delhi&quot;. So far as Delhi is concerned, these rules would\napply to mediation in a matter referred by the court concerned with a\ncriminal case as well as proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_130\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_125\">VIII.

In (2012) 10 SCC 303, Gian Singh v. State of Punjab, it was\nheld that this was in exercise of statutory power of the High Court\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_133\">Section 482</a> of the Cr.P.C. The relevant extract of the judgment\nis reproduced as under :\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">Crl.Ref.No.1/2016                                      Page 42 of 89</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_105\">          &quot;61. ... But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly\n        and predominatingly civil flavour stand on a different\n        footing for the purposes of quashing, particularly the\n        offences arising from commercial, financial, mercantile,\n        civil, partnership or such like transactions or the offences\n        arising out of matrimony relating to dowry, etc. or the\n        family disputes where the wrong is basically private or\n        personal in nature and the parties have resolved their\n        entire dispute. In this category of cases, the High Court\n        may quash the criminal proceedings if in its view, because\n        of the compromise between the offender and the victim,\n        the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and\n        continuation of the criminal case would put the accused\n        to great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice\n        would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal case\n        despite full and complete settlement and compromise with\n        the victim. In other words, the High Court must consider\n        whether it would be unfair or contrary to the interest of\n        justice to continue with the criminal proceeding or\n        continuation of the criminal proceeding would\n        tantamount to abuse of process of law despite settlement\n        and compromise between the victim and the wrongdoer and\n        whether to secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that\n        the criminal case is put to an end and if the answer to the\n        above question(s) is in the affirmative, the High Court\n        shall be well within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal\n        proceeding.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_127\">                            (Emphasis supplied)\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_128\">60.

Heinous and serious offences\n        involving mental depravity or offences such as murder, rape\n        and dacoity cannot appropriately be quashed though the\n        victim or the family of the victim have settled the dispute.\n        Such offences are, truly speaking, not private in nature but\n        have a serious impact upon society. The decision to continue\n        with the trial in such cases is founded on the overriding\n        element of public interest in punishing persons for serious\n        offences;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_134\">        (vii) As distinguished from serious offences, there may be\n        criminal cases which have an overwhelming or\n        predominant element of a civil dispute. They stand on a\n        distinct footing in so far as the exercise of the inherent\n        power to quash is concerned;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_135\">        (viii) Criminal cases involving offences which arise from\n        commercial, financial, mercantile, partnership or similar\n        transactions with an essentially civil flavour may in\n        appropriate situations fall for quashing where parties have\n        settled the dispute;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_136\">        (ix) In such a case, the High Court may quash the\n        criminal proceeding if in view of the compromise between\n        the disputants, the possibility of a conviction is remote and\n        the continuation of a criminal proceeding would cause\n        oppression and prejudice; and\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">Crl.Ref.No.1/2016                                     Page 45 of 89</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_137\">         (x) There is yet an exception to the principle set out in\n        propositions (viii) and (ix) above. Economic offences\n        involving the financial and economic well-being of the state\n        have implications which lie beyond the domain of a mere\n        dispute between private disputants. The High Court would be\n        justified in declining to quash where the offender is involved\n        in an activity akin to a financial or economic fraud or\n        misdemeanour. The consequences of the act complained of\n        upon the financial or economic system will weigh in the\n        balance.&#x27;\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_138\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"14713882\" id=\"span_52\">61.     The judicial precedent in (<a href=\"/doc/14713882/\" id=\"a_136\">2013) 5 SCC 226, K. Srinivas Rao v.\nD.A. Deepa</a> is in the context of a complaint filed by the respondent\nwife under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_137\">Section 498A</a> of the Indian Penal Code, against the\nappellant husband and his family members, the offence under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_138\">Section\n498A</a> of the IPC being non-compoundable. Noting that mediation, as\na method of alternative dispute redressal had got legal recognition,\nobservations regarding settlements of matrimonial disputes were made\nin paras 39 and 46 by the Supreme Court to the courts dealing with\nmatrimonial matters which read thus :</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_108\">        &quot;39. Quite often, the cause of the misunderstanding in a\n        matrimonial dispute is trivial and can be sorted out.\n        Mediation as a method of alternative dispute resolution has\n        got legal recognition now. We have referred several\n        matrimonial disputes to mediation centres. Our experience\n        shows that about 10% to 15% of matrimonial disputes get\n        settled in this Court through various mediation centres. We,\n        therefore, feel that at the earliest stage i.e. when the\n        dispute is taken up by the Family Court or by the court of\n        first instance for hearing, it must be referred to mediation\n        centres. ...\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">Crl.Ref.No.1/2016                                      Page 46 of 89</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_109\">         xxx                       xxx                        xxx\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_110\">        44. We, therefore, feel that though offence punishable\n        under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_139\">Section 498-A</a> IPC is not compoundable, in\n        appropriate cases if the parties are willing and if it\n        appears to the criminal court that there exist elements of\n        settlement, it should direct the parties to explore the\n        possibility of settlement through mediation. This is,\n        obviously, not to dilute the rigour, efficacy and purport of\n        <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_140\">Section 498-A</a> IPC, but to locate cases where the\n        matrimonial dispute can be nipped in bud in an equitable\n        manner. The Judges, with their expertise, must ensure that\n        this exercise does not lead to the erring spouse using\n        mediation process to get out of clutches of the law. During\n        mediation, the parties can either decide to part company on\n        mutually agreed terms or they may decide to patch up and\n        stay together. In either case for the settlement to come\n        through, the complaint will have to be quashed. In that\n        event, they can approach the High Court and get the\n        complaint quashed. If, however, they choose not to settle,\n        they can proceed with the complaint. In this exercise, there\n        is no loss to anyone. If there is settlement, the parties will\n        be saved from the trials and tribulations of a criminal case\n        and that will reduce the burden on the courts which will be\n        in the larger public interest. Obviously, the High Court\n        will quash the complaint only if after considering all\n        circumstances it finds the settlement to be equitable and\n        genuine. Such a course, in our opinion, will be beneficial\n        to those who genuinely want to accord a quietus to their\n        matrimonial disputes.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_111\">        xxx                       xxx                        xxx\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_112\">        46. We, therefore, issue directions, which the courts\n        dealing with the matrimonial matters shall follow.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_113\">        xxx                       xxx                        xxx\n        46.2. The criminal courts dealing with the complaint\n        under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_141\">Section 498-A</a> IPC should, at any stage and\n        particularly, before they take up the complaint for\n        hearing, refer the parties to mediation centre if they feel\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">Crl.Ref.No.1/2016                                        Page 47 of 89</span>\n         that there exist elements of settlement and both the parties\n        are willing. However, they should take care to see that in\n        this exercise, rigour, purport and efficacy of <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_142\">Section 498-A</a>\n        IPC is not diluted. Needless to say that the discretion to\n        grant or not to grant bail is not in any way curtailed by this\n        direction. It will be for the court concerned to work out the\n        modalities taking into consideration the facts of each case.\n        46.3. All mediation centres shall set up pre-litigation\n        desks/clinics; give them wide publicity and make efforts to\n        settle matrimonial disputes at pre-litigation stage.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_139\">                            (Emphasis supplied)\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_140\">62.

The Supreme Court\nhas accepted compromises in non-compoundable offences upon\nevaluation of the genuineness, fairness, equity and interests of justice\nin continuing with the criminal proceedings relating to non-\ncompoundable offences, after settlement of the entire dispute\nespecially in offences arising from &quot;commercial, financial, civil,\npartnership&quot; or such like transactions or relating to matrimonial or\nfamily disputes which are private in nature.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_141\">IX.

Before proceeding with the examination of the questions under\nreference, it is necessary to examine the spirit, intendment and object\nof the incorporation of <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_144\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act, the Preamble\nwhereof states &quot;Whereas it is expedient to define and amend the law\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">Crl.Ref.No.1/2016                                        Page 48 of 89</span>\n relating to promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques&quot;.

In this\npronouncement, the Supreme Court noted that cases arising under\n<a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_152\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act are really &quot;civil cases masquerading as\ncriminal cases&quot;. The statutory object in effect appears to be both\npunitive as also compensatory and restitutive in regard to cheque\ndishonouring cases.

Unlike that for other forms of crime, the\n          punishment here (insofar as the complainant is concerned)\n          is not a means of seeking retribution, but is more a means\n          to ensure payment of money. The complainant&#x27;s interest\n          lies primarily in recovering the money rather than seeing\n          the drawer of the cheque in jail. The threat of jail is only a\n          mode to ensure recovery. As against the accused who is\n          willing to undergo a jail term, there is little available as\n          remedy for the holder of the cheque.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_117\">              If we were to examine the number of complaints filed\n          which were &#x27;compromised&#x27; or &#x27;settled&#x27; before the final\n          judgment on one side and the cases which proceeded to\n          judgment and conviction on the other, we will find that the\n          bulk was settled and only a miniscule number continued.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_147\">      18. It is quite obvious that with respect to the offence of\n      dishonour of cheques, it is the compensatory aspect of the\n      remedy which should be given priority over the punitive\n      aspect. There is also some support for the apprehensions\n      raised by the learned Attorney General that a majority of\n      cheque bounce cases are indeed being compromised or\n      settled by way of compounding, albeit during the later stages\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">Crl.Ref.No.1/2016                                          Page 50 of 89</span>\n       of litigation thereby contributing to undue delay in justice\n      delivery. The problem herein is with the tendency of litigants\n      to belatedly choose compounding as a means to resolve their\n      dispute. Furthermore, the written submissions filed on behalf\n      of the learned Attorney General have stressed on the fact that\n      unlike <a href=\"/doc/91933/\" id=\"a_156\">Section 320</a> CrPC, <a href=\"/doc/177946336/\" id=\"a_157\">Section 147</a> of the Negotiable\n      Instruments Act provides no explicit guidance as to what stage\n      compounding can or cannot be done and whether\n      compounding can be done at the instance of the complainant\n      or with the leave of the court.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_148\">                              (Emphasis by us)\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_149\">67.

They arise from a civil dispute relating to\ndishonouring to a cheque but may result in a criminal consequence.\nEven though the statute is punitive in nature, however, its spirit,\nintendment and object is to provide compensation and ensure\nrestitution as well which aspects must received priority over\npunishment. The proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_159\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act are\ntherefore, distinct from other criminal cases.

The victim of the offence can compound the offence\n        notwithstanding anything contained in Cr. P.C. 1973. In\n        other words, the parties can settle the alleged criminal\n        wrong and conclude their dispute under adjudication and\n        request the Court where it is pending to pass appropriate\n        order viz: order of acquittal. Undisputedly, the petitioner\n        accused has approached this Court for scrutiny of the\n        legality and validity of the order of conviction and sentence\n        and, therefore, the original complainant can positively\n        appear before this Court and say that he has compounded\n        the offence with the accused and now he has not to pursue\n        the remedy, that he is not interested in proceeding with the\n        complaint and to see that the accused is sent to the prison.\n        The effect of the same would be practically or say similar to\n        a withdrawal from the prosecution with or without any\n        qualification. So, the original complainant if comes to the\n        Court and says that he is withdrawing himself from\n        prosecution on account of compromise and he has\n        compounded the matter, then obviously the conviction and\n        sentence shall have to be annulled/set aside. Considering\n        the language of the section, even there is no scope for the\n        Court to consider whether such a request should be\n        accepted or not. No formal permission to compound the\n        offence is required to be sought for.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_64\">Crl.Ref.No.1/2016                                       Page 52 of 89</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_119\">         9.

Subsequent\n        subsections deal with other contingencies, qualifications or\n        embargoes. But <a href=\"/doc/177946336/\" id=\"a_172\">Section 147</a> of the N.I. Act says that\n        offence shall be compoundable and it does not provide for\n        any other or further qualification or embargo like Sub-\n        section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/91933/\" id=\"a_173\">Section 320</a> of CrPC. The parties can\n        compound the offence as if the offence is otherwise\n        compoundable. Thus, the offence is made straightaway\n        compoundable like the case described under Sub-section\n        (1) of <a href=\"/doc/91933/\" id=\"a_174\">Section 320</a> of CrPC. Subsection (9) of <a href=\"/doc/91933/\" id=\"a_175\">Section 320</a>\n        of CrPC has no room to play because of non\n        obstante clause in <a href=\"/doc/177946336/\" id=\"a_176\">Section 147</a> of the N.I.

The Kerala High Court had taken a view\nthat when a criminal case is settled at a Lok Adalat, the award passed\nby it has to be treated only as an order of the criminal court and that it\ncannot be executed as a decree of the civil court.

The above discussion would show that proceedings under\n<a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_213\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act stand categorized as quasi-civil. In order to\nprovide meaningful interpretation and to do complete justice in such\nproceedings, criminal courts are known to have often utilized the\nprinciples in <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_214\">the Code of Civil Procedure</a> in such cases. These include\nthe summary proceedings for maintenance under Section 125 of the\nCr.P.C. as well as the proceedings under Section 145 of the Cr.P.C.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_80\">Crl.Ref.No.1/2016                                      Page 60 of 89</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_174\"> 83.

This would again\n        indicate that a proceeding under <a href=\"/doc/1912303/\" id=\"a_230\">Section 125</a> of the Code\n        is treated as a quasi-civil and quasi criminal proceeding.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_177\">                           (Emphasis furnished)\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_178\">85.     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"737962\" id=\"span_84\">In the context of proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/1405190/\" id=\"a_231\">Section 145</a> of the Cr.P.C.,\nin 1963 <a href=\"/doc/737962/\" id=\"a_232\">CriLJ 491, Madansetty Tirpataiah v.

Further, to my mind, proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/138755618/\" id=\"a_233\">Section 145</a> of\n        the Cr PC are more or less of a quasi-civil nature. So that\n        on analogy of Civil Suit, in cases under this Section if\n        within the time fixed by the Magistrate, the party is not in a\n        position to file documents in his possession which support\n        his claim, and he is able to satisfy the Court that for\n        sufficient and valid reasons he could not file the said\n        documents with in the prescribed time, it would be open to\n        the Magistrate in the ends of justice to allow a party to file\n        the said documents.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_141\">        7. It is no doubt true that there is no provision in the\n        <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_234\">Criminal Procedure Code</a> analogous to Civil Procedure,\n        for filing of documents at a late stage, but having regard\n        to the nature of the proceedings in the ends of justice such\n        exercise of discretion cannot entirely be ruled out.\n</blockquote><pre id=\"pre_8\">               xxx                 xxx                xxx.&quot;\n                              (Emphasis by us)\n\n\n</pre><blockquote id=\"blockquote_142\">86.

The present reference manifests that in the event of breach of\nthe settlement, the courts have to recommence proceedings on merits\nand the evidentiary/legal value of the mediated settlement remains\nundetermined.

Then, the question is what is to effect of mediation\n         agreement in a criminal matter. Admittedly, if the matter is\n         referred for mediation, the mediator is not acting neither\n         as Adalath nor as an Arbitrator or Conciliator to resolve\n         the disputes by passing an award either under the\n         provisions of <a href=\"/doc/26738839/\" id=\"a_247\">Legal Services Authorities Act</a> or under the\n         provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_248\">Arbitration and Conciliation Act</a>.

Till, the seal of the\n         court is affixed on the agreement, and a decree is passed\n         on that basis that agreement, it has no legal effect in the\n         eye of law.

In para 14, the Kerala High Court considered the question as to\nwhether such agreement could be treated as evidence in a criminal\nmatter. While answering this question, it was observed by the court\nthat even if the complainant had agreed in the mediation to settle the\nmatter for a lesser amount than the amount mentioned in the cheque, it\ncould not be said that the actual amount due is the amount agreed in\nthe mediation. Para 14 of the judgment reads as follows :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_148\">      &quot;14. Then, the question is whether the agreement entered into\n      between the parties in a mediation can be treated as evidence\n      in a criminal matter. It may be mentioned here, unless the\n      agreement is accepted by the court and a decree is passed\n      under<a href=\"/doc/210095/\" id=\"a_260\"> S. 89</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure r/w O. 23 R. 3\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_96\">Crl.Ref.No.1/2016                                         Page 69 of 89</span>\n     <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_261\">of Code of Civil Procedure</a>, that will have no effect, unless\n    that has been converted into a conciliation agreement based\n    on which an award is passed by the Conciliator under the\n    provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_262\">Arbitration and Conciliation Act</a>. Further, it\n    is the cardinal principle in the mediation that whatever\n    transpired in the mediation cannot be disclosed even before the\n    court of law and that cannot be called upon to be produced as\n    evidence as well as it will affect the confidentiality of the things\n    transpired in the process of mediation. So the party who did not\n    honour the settlement which was effected in the process of\n    mediation, then, is not entitled to use the same as evidence\n    before the court and agreement also cannot be marked in\n    evidence as it has no legal effect unless it is accepted by the\n    court and a decree is passed under<a href=\"/doc/1147393/\" id=\"a_263\"> S. 89</a> r/w O. 23 R. 3 <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_264\">of the\n    Code of Civil Procedure</a>. That cannot be possible in a\n    Criminal Court. Further even if the party had agreed to settle\n    the matter for a lesser amount than the amount mentioned in\n    the cheque in the mediation, it cannot be said that, that was the\n    amount payable as in the mediation, parties can forgo so many\n    things for the purpose of achieving harmony between the\n    parties and restore their relationship. So the amounts arrived\n    in a mediation also cannot be used as evidence for coming to\n    the conclusion that the amount mentioned in the cheque is\n    not the real amount due, and the complainant is not entitled\n    to maintain the action on the basis of that cheque. The court\n    has to allow the parties to adduce evidence ignoring the\n    mediation agreement and dispose of the case on the basis of\n    evidence adduced by parties as it should not be put in evidence\n    in view of the bar under rules 20, 21 and 22 of the Civil\n    Procedure (Alternative Disputes Resolution) Rules Kerala 2008\n    which reads as follows:--\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_149\">       Rule 20:-- Confidentiality, disclosure and inadmissibility\n       of information--\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_150\">           (1) The mediator shall not disclose confidential\n              information concerning the dispute received from any\n              party to the proceedings unless permitted in writing\n              by the said party.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_97\">Crl.Ref.No.1/2016                                        Page 70 of 89</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_151\">             (2) Parties shall maintain confidentiality in respect of\n               events that transpired during mediation and shall not\n               rely on or introduce the said information in any other\n               proceedings as to:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_152\">               (a) views expressed by a party in the course of the\n                  mediation proceedings;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_153\">               (b) documents obtained during the mediation which\n                  were expressly required to be treated as\n                  confidential or other notes, drafts or information\n                  given by parties or mediators;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_154\">               (c) Proposals made or views expressed by the\n                  mediator.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_155\">               (d) Admission made by a party in the course of\n                  mediation proceedings.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_156\">               (e) The fact that a party had or had not indicated\n                  willingness to accept a proposal.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_157\">            (3) There shall be no stenographic or audio or video\n               recording of the mediation proceedings.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_186\">        Rule 21:-- Privacy- Mediation sessions and meetings are\n        private; only the concerned parties or their counsel or\n        authorised representatives can attend.

The court noted that &quot;The\ncomplainant was literate.

There can be no doubt that\non that day there was a valid composition within the meaning of\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_113\">Crl.Ref.No.1/2016                                       Page 76 of 89</span>\n <a href=\"/doc/1641897/\" id=\"a_298\">section 345</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure before the court.

There is no legal prohibition upon a criminal court seized of\nsuch complaint, to whom a mediated settlement is reported, from\nadopting the above procedure. Application of the above enunciation\nof law to a mediation arising out of a criminal case manifests that a\nsettlement agreement would require to be in writing and signed by the\nparties or their counsels. The same has to be placed before the court\nwhich has to be satisfied that the agreement was lawful and consent of\nthe parties was voluntary and not obtained because of any force,\npressure or undue influence. Therefore, the court would record the\nstatement of the parties or their authorized agents on oath affirming\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_114\">Crl.Ref.No.1/2016                                    Page 77 of 89</span>\n the settlement, its voluntariness and their undertaking to abide by it in\nthe manner followed by the civil court when considering a settlement\nplaced before it under <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_302\">Order XXIII Rule 3 of the CPC</a>. The court\nwould thereafter pass an appropriate order accepting the agreement,\nincorporating the terms of the settlement regarding payment under\n<a href=\"/doc/177946336/\" id=\"a_303\">Section 147</a> of the NI Act and the undertakings of the parties.

In having so proceeded, there is a satisfaction of the\nvoluntariness and legality of the terms of the settlement of the court\nand acceptance of the terms thereof as well as a specific order in terms\nthereof.     Consequently, the amount payable under the settlement,\nwould become an amount payable under an order of the criminal\ncourt.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_210\">107.

There can be no\nmanner of doubt that once a settlement is reported to the court and\nmade the basis of seeking the court&#x27;s indulgence, the parties ought not\nto be able to resile from such a position. So what is the remedy\navailable to a complainant if the respondent commits breach of the\nmediation settlement and defaults in making the agreed payments?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_214\">109.

In the event of either party resiling from the agreed upon\nsettlement which has received the imprimatur of the court, the party\nattempting to breach the settlement and undertaking cannot be\npermitted to avoid making the payment.
