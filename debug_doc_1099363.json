Baharan Mian, appre-\nhending\t trouble,  ran inside Co arm himself  but  his\twife\nprevented  him from coming out again. At that time,  Baharan\nMian&#x27;s two infant daughters, Sahana Khatoon aged about seven\nyears  and Chand Tara aged about seven months, were  playing\nin the &#x27;dalan&#x27; of his house. Failing in their object to kill\nBaharan\t Mlan, accused No. 1 gave farsa blows on  the  head,\nabdomen\t and  left thumb of Sahana Khatoon  causing  serious\ninjuries, and accused No. 2 gave one farsa blow on the\thead\nof infant Chand Tara.

The conviction of the remaining four  accused\nunder  <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_30\">section\t302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_31\">149</a> was, however,  altered\tto  <a href=\"/doc/1540253/\" id=\"a_32\">sections\n326</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_33\">149</a>\t and the sentence of imprisonment for life given  to\neach  of  them\twas substituted by a  sentence\tof  rigorous\nimprisonment  for  seven years. Their convictions  and\tsen-\ntences on the other counts were, however, maintained:\n    Before  this  Court it was contended on  behalf  of\t the\nappellants that (1) the evidence adduced by the\t prosecution\nwas not reliable; (2) Even on the facts found proved by\t the\ncourts\tbelow, accused Nos. 1 to 6 could not be held  guilty\nof  murder with the aid of <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_34\">section 149</a>, I.P.C. as the  kill-\nings  of the two girls was outside the common object of\t the\nunlawful assembly; (3) the facts of the case did not warrant\na death penalty in the case of accused Nos. 1 and 2, more so\nbecause the procedural requirement of <a href=\"/doc/1986933/\" id=\"a_35\">section 235(2)</a> of\t the\nCr.  P.C.  was not followed in letter and  spirit;  and\t (4)\n<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_36\">section 302</a>, I.P.C., and <a href=\"/doc/324405/\" id=\"a_37\">section 354(3)</a>, Cr.P.C., insofar as\nthey permit the imposition of the death penalty were  viola-\ntive of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_38\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_39\">, 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_40\">21</a> of the Constitution of India.\n    While  partly  allowing the appeals\t by  converting\t the\nsentence  of  death in the case of accused nos. 1 and  2  to\nimprisonment for life under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_41\">section 302</a>, I.P.C., and setting\naside  the conviction of accused nos. 3 to 6  under  <a href=\"/doc/1540253/\" id=\"a_42\">section\n326</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_43\">149</a> I.P.C., the Court,\n    HELD:  (1) There is no substance in the contention\tthat\nthe  prosecution  evidence is unreliable and should  not  be\nacted  upon  for confirming the conviction  of\tthe  accused\npersons. [508B-C]\n    (2) If the prosecution did not examine some persons\t who\nwere  admittedly  present  at the scene\t of  occurrence,  on\nlearning that they were won over, it cannot be said that the\nprosecution  was  unfair to the accused\t persons.  The\tnon-\nexamination  of\t these persons cannot affect  the  probative\nvalue of the evidence of other prosecution witnesses. [508F]\n    (3)\t <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 149</a>. <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_45\">I.P.C</a>., creates a.  specific  offence.\nSince  this section imposes a constructive penal  liability,\nit must be strictly construed. [509G]\n500\n    (4) It is not the intention of the legislature in enact-\ning <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_46\">section 149</a> to render every member of an unlawful assem-\nbly liable to punishment for every offence committed by\t one\nor  more of its members. In order to invoke <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_47\">section  149</a>  it\nmust be shown that the incriminating act was done to  accom-\nplish the common object of the unlawful assembly. Even if an\nact  incidental to the common object is committed to  accom-\nplish the common object of the unlawful assembly, it must be\nwithin\tthe knowledge of other members as one likely  to  be\ncommitted  in prosecution of the common object. If the\tmem-\nbers of the assembly knew or were aware of the likelihood of\na particular offence being committed in. prosecution of\t the\ncommon\tobject they would be liable for the same under\tsec-\ntion 149. <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_48\">I.P.C</a>. [510F-H]\n    (5) What is important in each case is to find out if the\noffence was committed to accomplish the common object of the\nassembly  or was one which the members knew to be likely  to\nbe  committed.\tThere  must be a nexus\tbetween\t the  common\nobject\tand the offence committed, and if it is\t found\tthat\nthe  same  was committed to accomplish\tthe  common  object,\nevery  member  of the assembly will become  liable  for\t the\nsame. [509H; 510A-B]\n    (6) In the instant case, the common object of the unlaw-\nful assembly, as alleged in the charge, was to kill  Baharan\nMian.  When accused Nos. 1 and 2 realised that Baharan\tMian\nwas beyond their reach. they. frustrated at their failure to\naccomplish  their  mission,  wielded their  weapons  on\t the\ninnocent  girls, which was no part of the common  object  of\nthe unlawful assembly. For accomplishing their common object\nit  was not necessary to kill the two girls who were  not  a\nhinderance  to\taccused\t Nos. 1 and  2\taccomplishing  their\ncommon\tobject.\t Accused Nos. 3 to 6 cannot,  therefore,  be\nconvicted for the injuries caused to the two minor girls  by\naccused Nos. 1 and 2, with the aid of <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_49\">section 149</a>. [511A-B]\n    (7) <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_50\">Section 302</a>, I.P.C, casts a heavy duty on the  Court\nto choose between death and imprisonment for life. When\t the\nCourt is called upon to choose between the convict&#x27;s cry  &#x27;I\nwant  to live&#x27; and the prosecutor&#x27;s demand &#x27;he\tdeserves  to\ndie&#x27;, it goes without saying that the Court must show a high\ndegree\tof concern and sensitiveness in the choice  of\tsen-\ntence. [511D-E]\n    (8)\t In  our justice delivery system  several  difficult\ndecisions  are\tleft  to the  presiding\t officer,  sometimes\nwithout providing the scales or the weights for the same. In\ncases of murder, however, since the choice\n501\nis  between  capital punishment and life  imprisonment,\t the\nlegislature  has  provided a guideline in the form  of\tsub-\nsection\t (3) of <a href=\"/doc/203036/\" id=\"a_51\">section 354</a> of the Code of  Criminal  Proce-\ndure, 1973. [511E-F]\n    (9)\t When  the law casts a duty on the  Judge  to  state\nreasons\t it follows that he is under a legal  obligation  to\nexplain his choice of the sentence. It may seem trite to say\nso  but the existence of the &#x27;special reason clause&#x27; in\t the\nabove  provision  implies that the Court can  in  fit  cases\nimpose\tthe  extreme penalty of death  which  negatives\t the\ncontention  that there never can be a valid reason to  visit\nan  offender  with the death penalty, no matter\t how  cruel,\ngruesome or shocking the crime may be. [512A-C]\n    (10)  Where\t a sentence of severity is  imposed,  it  is\nimperative  that  the Judge should indicate the\t basis\tupon\nwhich  he considers a sentence of that magnitude  justified.\nUnless\tthere are special reasons, special to the  facts  of\nthe particular case, which can be cataloged as justifying  a\nsevere\tpunishment,  the  Judge would not  award  the  death\nsentence. If a Judge finds that he is unable to explain with\nreasonable  accuracy the basis for selecting the  higher  of\nthe  two  sentences,  his choice should fail  on  the  lower\nsentence. [512D-E]\n    (11)  The  choice of the sentence has to be\t made  after\nfollowing  the procedure set out in sub-section (2) of\tsec-\ntion  235  of the Code. Since the provision is\tintended  to\ngive  the accused an opportunity to place before  the  Court\nall  the relevant material having a bearing on the  question\nof  sentence,  there can be no doubt that the  provision  is\nsalutary and must be strictly followed. [513D, H; 514A]\n    (12) The requirement of hearing the accused is  intended\nto satisfy the rule of natural justice. In the case of\tlife\nor  death, the presiding officer must show a high degree  of\nconcern\t for the statutory right of the accused\t and  should\nnot treat it as a mere formality to be crossed before making\nthe  choice of the sentence. If the choice is  made  without\ngiving\tthe  accused an effective and  real  opportunity  to\nplace  his  antecedents,  social  and  economic\t background,\nmitigating  and extenuating circumstances, etc.\t before\t the\nCourt, the Court&#x27;s decision on the sentence would be vulner-\nable. [514C]\n    (13)  A sentencing decision taken without following\t the\nrequirements  of sub-section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1986933/\" id=\"a_52\">section 235</a> of the\tCode\nin letter and spirit may have to be replaced by an appropri-\nate  order.  In the instant case, the Trial  Court  actually\ntreated it as a mere formality as is evident from\n502\nthe  fact  that\t it recorded the finding of  guilt  on\t31st\nMarch,\t1987, and on the same day before the  accused  could\nabsorb and overcome the shock of conviction they were  asked\nif  they  had anything to say on the question  of  sentence.\nImmediately  thereafter\t the  decision\timposing  the  death\npenalty on the two accused was pronounced. [514B, E]\n    (14)  As a general rule, the Trial Courts  should  after\nrecording the conviction adjourn the matter to a future date\nand call upon both the prosecution as well as the defence to\nplace  the  relevant  material bearing on  the\tquestion  of\nsentence before it and thereafter pronounce the sentence  to\nbe imposed on the offender. [514F-G]\n    (15) In the instant case, the Trial Court did not attach\nsufficient  importance to the mandatory requirement of\tsub-\nsection (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1986933/\" id=\"a_53\">section 235</a> of the Code. The High Court\talso\nhad  before  it only the scanty material placed\t before\t the\nSessions Judge when it confirmed the death penalty.  Absence\nof particulars of ancedents of accused, their socio economic\nconditions, the impact of their crime on the community, etc.\nmakes the choice of punishment difficult. [514G-H]\n    (16)  It  is necessary that the  maximum  sentence\tpre-\nscribed\t by law should be reserved for &#x27;the rarest of  rare&#x27;\ncases  which  are  of an exceptional  nature.  Sentences  of\nseverity  are  imposed\tt9 reflect the\tseriousness  of\t the\ncrime,\tto  promote  respect for the law,  to  provide\tjust\npunishment for the offence, to afford adequate deterrent  to\ncriminal  conduct and to protect the community from  further\nsimilar conduct. [515G]\n    (17) In the instant case, unfortunately the material for\nchoice\tof sentence is scanty. The motive for the  crime  is\nobscure,  the  one stated. namely, the quarrel\tbetween\t two\ninfants\t of  both sides, does not seem to  be  correct.\t The\nkillings were not for gain. The change shows that the target\nwas  Baharan Mian, the father, and not the two infants.\t The\nkilling\t of the two infants was not in the contemplation  of\nany  of the accused. Both the girls were the victims of\t the\noffenders&#x27;  ire resulting from frustration at the escape  of\ntheir  target. There is nothing so uncommon about the  crime\nas  to make the case an exceptional one. The mere fact\tthat\ninfants are killed, without more, is not sufficient to bring\nthe case within the category of &#x27;the rarest of rare&#x27;  cases.\n[516C-E]\n    Bachan  Singh v.

The  substantive\tsen-\ntences were ordered to run concurrently. Since accused\tNos.\n1 and 2 were awarded the death penalty a reference was\tmade\nto the High Court which came to be numbered as Reference No.\n3  of 1987. Accused Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 5 preferred an  appeal,\nCriminal  Appeal No. 140 of 1987, challenging their  convic-\ntions  and  sentences awarded to them by  the  Trial  Court.\nAccused\t Nos. 4 and 6 preferred a separate appeal,  Criminal\nAppeal\tNo. 136 of 1987, against their convictions and\tsen-\ntences\tby the Trial Court. The said reference and both\t the\nappeals\t were  disposed of by the High. Court  by  a  common\njudgment.  The\tHigh Court dismissed the appeal\t insofar  as\naccused Nos. 1 and 2 are concerned and, while accepting\t the\nreference,  confirmed the sentence of death awarded to\tthem\nfor  the murder of two the infant girls. The  conviction  of\nthe remaining four accused under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_80\">Section 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_81\">149</a> was, howev-\ner, altered to <a href=\"/doc/1540253/\" id=\"a_82\">Section 326</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_83\">149</a> and the sentence of imprison-\nment  for  life given to each of them was substituted  by  a\nsentence  of  rigorous imprisonment for seven  years.  Their\nconvictions and sentences on the other counts were, however,\nmaintained.  Feeling aggrieved by the convictions  and\tsen-\ntences\tawarded\t to  them on different counts  all  the\t six\naccused\t persons have preferred the present two\t appeals  by\nspecial leave.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\">    Briefly  stated  the  prosecution case is  that  on\t the\nafternoon  of  25th July, 1985 around 4.30 p.m.\t when  PW  6\nBaharan\t Mian was sitting at the entrance of his house,\t the\naforesaid six accused persons came from the west armed\twith\ndeadly weapons; accused Nos. 1 and 2 were carrying &#x27;farsas&#x27;,\naccused\t Nos.  3 and 4 were armed with spears  (bhalas)\t and\naccused\t Nos.  5 and 6 were armed with sticks  (Lathis).  On\nseeing them PW 6 got up and went to the &#x27;osra&#x27; (verandah) of\nhis house. Accused No. 3 began to untie the buffalo tethered\nin front of the house while the other accused persons  show-\nered  abuses on PW 6, to which the latter  objected.  There-\nupon, accused Nos. 4 and 6 shouted &#x27;Sale ko jan se mar\tdo&#x27;.\nImmediately thereafter, accused Nos. 1 and 2 moved menacing-\nly  towards PW 6. The two infants Sahana Khatoon  and  Chand\nTara  were then playing in the &#x27;dalan&#x27; outside\tthe  western\nroom.  On seeing accused Nos. 1 and 2 approaching  him\tduly\narmed with farsas PW 6 apprehended trouble and ran into\t the\nadjoining room to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">505</span>\narm  himself with a spear. His wife, PW 5 Laila Khatun,\t who\nwas  in the room, however, prevented him from going out\t for\nfear  that he may be done to death by the  accused  persons.\nRealising  that\t PW  6 has entered the inner  room  and\t was\nprevented  by his wife from coming out, accused No.  1\tgave\nfarsa  blows on the head, abdomen and left thumb  of  Sahana\nKhatoon\t causing  serious injuries. Accused No. 2  gave\t one\nfarsa  blow on the head of infant Chand Tara. The  neighbors\nPW 2 Ful Mohammad Mian, PW 3 Ali Asgar, PW 4 Vidya Giri\t and\nothers,\t namely, Jalaluddin Ahmad, Sadik Mian,\tRam  Chandra\nPrasad, Bhikhari Mian, etc. intervened, pacified the assail-\nants  and sent them away. After the assailants had left\t the\nscene  of occurrence the two injured girls were\t removed  to\nthe city dispensary where the First Information Report of PW\n6  was\trecorded at about 6.45\tp.m.  Unfortunately,  Sahana\nKhatoon\t died shortly after she was admitted to the  dispen-\nsary.  Her  younger sister Chand Tara succumbed to  her\t in-\njuries\ton  23rd  August, 1985. Immediately  after  the\t two\ninjured\t were removed to the dispensary for treatment, PW  7\nDr.  Haliwant Singh who examined Sahana Khatoon\t noted\tthat\nshe  had a sharp cutting injury on the anterior half of\t the\nhead  causing  a  fracture of cranial bone  with  the  brain\nsubstance protruding out, a sharp cutting injury on the left\nilliao\tfossa and a sharp cutting injury on the\t left  thumb\nand left index finger. PW 1 Dr. Anil Kumar Verma, the Senior\nAssistant  Surgeon  in Siwan Sadar Hospital,  performed\t the\nautopsy on the dead body of Sahana Khatoon on the  afternoon\nof 26th July, 1985. Since the fact that Sahana Khatoon\tdied\na homicidal death is not in dispute, we need not set out the\nfindings recorded by PW 1 in his postmortem report.  Suffice\nit to say that in the opinion of PW 1 death was due to shock\nand  haemorrhage resulting from the injuries caused  to\t the\nvictim with the farsa.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">    The\t injured Chand Tara was examined on the same day  by\nPW 7. He had noticed a sharp cutting injury on the  anterior\nhalf of the head slightly to the right of the mid-line\twith\nthe brain matter coming out from the posterior half. She was\nadmitted  as  an indoor patient but was discharged  on\t13th\nAugust,\t 1985.\tA few days later she died  on  23rd  August,\n1985. PW 10 Dr. Ahmad performed the autopsy on the dead body\nof Chand Tara and he found that she had an infected ulcer 3&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">x  1-1/4&quot; by cranial cavity deep communicated with brain  on\nthe  anteriofrontal portion of the head, On  dissection\t the\nmeningities and the brain matter were found to be congested.\nIn  his\t view,\tthe meningitis and  encephalitis  which\t had\nresulted  due to infection resulting from the injury  caused\nby  a  sharp cutting weapon like a farsa were the  cause  of\ndeath. It is evident from the above evidence that Chand Tara\nalso died a homicidal death.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">506</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">\t\t  The  finding\tthat both the girls  died  a\n\t      homicidal death is unassailable in view of the\n\t      clear evidence of the aforesaid three medical-\n\t      men, namely, PW 1, PW 7, and PW 10. The  ques-\n\t      tion  then is whether the appellants  are\t re-\n\t      sponsible for their deaths and if so, to\twhat\n\t      extent?  To bring home the guilt\tagainst\t the\n\t      six accused persons, the prosecution  examined\n\t      five eye witnesses to the occurrence,  namely,\n\t      PWs  2  to 6. These five\teye  witnesses\thave\n\t      unfolded\tthe  prosecution case that  the\t six\n\t      accused persons had formed an unlawful  assem-\n\t      bly the common object whereof was to kill PW 6\n\t      Baharan  Mian.  In pursuance  of\tthat  common\n\t      object  they, duly armed with weapons such  as\n\t      farsas,  bhalas and lathis, entered the  resi-\n\t      dential  premises\t of PW 6 on the\t evening  of\n\t      25th July, 1985 and committed the acts set out\n\t      earlier.\tThe  courts  below  found  that\t the\n\t      presence\tof PWs 5 and 6 in the house at\tthat\n\t      point  of time could not be doubted.  In\tfact\n\t      these accused persons had come to the house to\n\t      kill  PW 6. PWs 2, 3 and 4 who can be said  to\n\t      be  dependable witnesses have  also  supported\n\t      the prosecution case as narrated by PWs 5\t and\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">\t      6. The evidence of these prosecution witnesses\n\t      stands further corroborated by the evidence of\n\t      PW  7 who had seen the wounds on the  two\t in-\n\t      jured  soon after the incident. PWs 1  and  10\n\t      who  performed the post-mortem examination  on\n\t      the dead bodies also lend corroboration to the\n\t      testimony\t of  the eye witnesses.\t The  courts\n\t      below,  therefore,  recorded  the\t convictions\n\t      relying  on  the\tevidence  of  the  aforesaid\n\t      witnesses as set out earlier.

We have  carefully\t scrutinised\nthe evidence of the aforesaid five eye witnesses and we\t are\ninclined to think that their evidence was correctly appreci-\nated by both the Courts below. The presence of PWs 5 and  6,\nthe  parents of the two victim girls, in the house  at\tthat\npoint  of  time\t cannot be disputed. In\t fact,\tthe  accused\npersons had constituted an unlawful assembly with a view  to\nkilling PW 6, the father of the two girls. With that  avowed\nobject they went, duly armed with lethal weapons, to  launch\nan  attack on PW 6. After accused No. 3 had untied the\tbuf-\nfallo notwithstanding the protest from PW 6, accused Nos.  4\nand  6 gave the call to kill PW 6. Encouraged by  this\tcall\naccused\t Nos. 1 and 2 moved menacingly towards PW 6 who\t was\nthen standing in &#x27;osra&#x27;. Realising that accused nos. 1 and 2\nwere  out to kill him, PW 6 went inside the room to fetch  a\nbhala  to defend himself. His wife PW 5 who was in the\troom\nsensing\t danger\t to his life stood in his way  and  did\t not\npermit him to go out and face accused Nos. 1 and 2. PWs 2, 3\nand 4 who were neighbours saw the incident from close  quar-\nters when accused Nos. 1 and 2 dealt fatal blows with  their\nfarsas to the two girls who were playing in the &#x27;dalan&#x27;.  PW\n2 who is the brother of PW 6 was in the field to the east of\nthe  house  and\t was, therefore, in a position\tto  see\t the\nincident. PW 3 was returning from the bazar when he saw\t the\naccused\t persons at the door of PW 6. He heard\tthe  accused\npersons uttering abuses and the call given by accused Nos. 4\nand 6 to kill PW 6. He also saw the accused persons entering\nthe house and going towards the room which PW 6 had  entered\nto  fetch  a bhala. In the end he saw accused Nos. 1  and  2\ninflicting farsa blows on the two girls. He was\t cross-exam-\nined at length but except for minor contradictions here\t and\nthere  which  are only to be/expected when a  witness  gives\nevidence after a lapse of time, nothing substantial  shaking\nthe  substratum\t of  the prosecution case  has\tsurfaced  to\ndiscredit  him.\t PW  4 was at the saw mill  of\tRam  Chandra\nPrasad when he saw the accused persons coming from the\twest\nand proceeding towards the east.-He saw these persons  going\nto the house of PW 6 and heard them showering abuses. In his\ncross-examination an attempt was made to show that he  could\nnot  be\t present at Ram Chandra Prasad&#x27;s saw  mill  at\tthat\nhours  since he was a Government Servant and admittedly\t his\nnormal duty hours were from\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">508</span>\n10  a.m.  to 5 p.m. Further effort was to show that  he\t was\nconnected  with\t a case between Bhikhari Dass and  Sita\t Ram\nPrasad\tpending\t under <a href=\"/doc/138788/\" id=\"a_89\">Section 145</a>, Cr. P.C. in\t respect  of\npossession  of some land. He has also disowned knowledge  of\nany  dispute  between Bhikhari Dass and\t Mainuddin  Mian  in\nrespect of another parcel of land. He was cross-examined  at\nlength\tto  prove  that he was an interested  and  a  biased\nwitness.  Even if the evidence of this witness\tis  ignored,\nthere is sufficient evidence on record to support the  find-\nings  recorded by both the courts below. We are,  therefore,\nof the opinion that there is no substance in the  contention\nof the learned counsel for the accused that the\t prosecution\nevidence  is not reliable and should not be acted  upon\t for\nconfirming the conviction of the accused persons.\n    It was next submitted by learned counsel for the accused\nthat some of the prosecution witnesses, namely, Jallaluddin,\nBhikhari  Mian\tand Ram Chandra Prasad who  were  admittedly\npresent at the scene of occurrence according to the prosecu-\ntion and had witnessed the entire incident were deliberately\ndropped\t with  a view to suppressing the  truth.  We  cannot\naccept this contention for the simple reason that apart from\nboth PW 5 and PW 6 having deposed that they were pressurised\nby  the defence the High Court has found in paragraph 36  of\nits judgment that efforts were made by the defence to  scare\naway  the  witnessess from giving evidence. There  is  ample\nmaterial  on record to conclude that  considerable  pressure\nwas  exerted on the prosecution witnesses to stay away\tfrom\nthe witness box. Some succumbed to the threats and  pressure\nwhile  some  others did not and displayed  courage  to\tgive\nevidence  and  state  the truth. In this  backdrop,  if\t the\nprosecution did not examine Jallaluddin, Ram Chandra  Prasad\nand  Bhikhari  Mian on learning that they were won  over  it\ncannot\tbe said that the prosecution was unfair to  the\t ac-\ncused persons. Mr. Garg submitted that there was nothing  to\nshow  that  the accused persons were in any  way  guilty  of\npressurising  or threatening the witnesses. That is  besides\nthe  point.  What is relevant is the fact  it  so  happened.\nTherefore,  the non-examination of the\taforesaid  witnesses\ncannot\taffect the probative value of the evidence of  other\nprosecution witnesses.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_15\">    We\tnow proceed to consider whether accused Nos. 3 to  6\nhave been rightly convicted with the aid of <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_90\">Section 149</a>\t for\nthe  acts  of  accused Nos. 1 and 2.  <a href=\"/doc/1542085/\" id=\"a_91\">Section  141</a>,  I.P.C.,\ndefines an unlawful assembly as an assembly of five or\tmore\npersons whose common object is to commit any one of the five\nacts  enumerated  therein. The explanation to  that  section\nmakes it clear that an assembly which was not unlawful\twhen\nit assembled, may subsequently become an unlawful assembly.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">509</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_16\"><a href=\"/doc/1364868/\" id=\"a_92\">Section\t 142</a>  states: whoever, being aware  of\tfacts  which\nrender\tany  assembly an  unlawful  assembly,  intentionally\njoins  that  assembly, or continues in it, is said to  be  a\nmember\tof  an unlawful assembly. <a href=\"/doc/1096965/\" id=\"a_93\">Section 143</a> sets  out\t the\npunishment  for\t being\ta member of  an\t unlawful  assembly.\n<a href=\"/doc/1196530/\" id=\"a_94\">Section 144</a> prescribes the punishment for joining an  unlaw-\nful  assembly  armed with deadly weapons. <a href=\"/doc/138788/\" id=\"a_95\">Section  145</a>\tpre-\nscribes\t the  punishment  for joining or  continuing  in  an\nunlawful  assembly  which has been  commanded  to  disperse.\n<a href=\"/doc/1601950/\" id=\"a_96\">Section 146</a> defines rioting. It says that whenever force  or\nviolence  is used by an unlawful assembly, or by any  member\nthereof, in prosecution of the common object of such  assem-\nbly, every member of such assembly is guilty of the  offence\nof  rioting. <a href=\"/doc/1258372/\" id=\"a_97\">Section 147</a> then prescribes the punishment\t for\nrioting.  <a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_98\">Section 148</a> prescribes the punishment for  rioting\nby  members  of\t an unlawfully assembly\t armed\twith  deadly\nweapons. Then comes <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_99\">Section 149</a> which reads as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">\t      &quot;If  an offence is committed by any member  of\n\t      an  unlawful  assembly in prosecution  of\t the\n\t      common object of that assembly, or such as the\n\t      members of that assembly knew to be likely  to\n\t      be  committed in prosecution of  that  object,\n\t      every  person who, at the time of the  commit-\n\t      ting of that offence, is a member of the\tsame\n\t      assembly, is guilty of that offence.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">Therefore,  in order to fasten vicarious  responsibility  on\nany  member  of an unlawful assembly  the  prosecution\tmust\nprove  that  the  act constituting an offence  was  done  in\nprosecution of the common object of that assembly or the act\ndone  is  such as the members of that assembly\tknew  to  be\nlikely\tto be committed in prosecution of the common  object\nof  that  assembly.  Under this\t section,  therefore,  every\nmember\tof an unlawful assembly renders himself\t liable\t for\nthe  criminal act or acts of any other member or members  of\nthat  assembly provided the same is/are done in\t prosecution\nof the common object or is/are such as every member of\tthat\nassembly  knew\tto be likely to be committed.  This  section\ncreates\t a  specific offence and makes every member  of\t the\nunlawful assembly liable for the offence or offences commit-\nted  in\t the  course of the  occurrence\t provided  the\tsame\nwas/were  committed in prosecution of the common  object  or\nwas/were  such\tas the members of that assembly knew  to  be\nlikely\tto be committed. Since this section imposes  a\tcon-\nstructive penal liability, it must be strictly construed  as\nit  seeks to punish members of an unlawful assembly for\t the\noffence or offences committed by their associate or  associ-\nates in carrying out the common object of the assembly. What\nis important in each case is to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">510</span>\nfind  out  if the offence was committed\t to  accomplish\t the\ncommon\tobject of the assembly or was one which the  members\nknew  to  be likely to be committed. There must be  a  nexus\nbetween\t the common object and the offence committed and  if\nit  is found that the same was committed to  accomplish\t the\ncommon\tobject\tevery  member of the  assembly\twill  become\nliable\tfor the same. Therefore, any offence committed by  a\nmember\tof an unlawful assembly in prosecution of anyone  or\nmore  of  the  five objects mentioned in  <a href=\"/doc/1542085/\" id=\"a_100\">Section  141</a>\twill\nrender\this  companies constituting  the  unlawful  assembly\nliable for that offence with the aid of <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_101\">Section 149</a>,  I.P.C.\nIn  the\t present  case, the common object  of  the  unlawful\nassembly  as alleged in the charge was to kill PW 6  Baharan\nMian. To accomplish that objective accused Nos. 1 and 2 went\nafter PW 6. Sensing danger PW 6 ran into the adjoining\troom\nto fetch a spear to defend himself. His wife PW 5,  however,\nblocked\t his  way  and did not permit him to  go  out.\tWhen\naccused\t Nos.  1 and 2 realised that PW 6 was  beyond  their\nreach, they, frustrated at their failure to accomplish their\nmission,  wielded  their weapons on the innocent  girls\t who\nwere  playing  in the Dalan. The common object\thaving\tthus\nbeen  frustrated, accused Nos. 1 and 2 took out their  wrath\non the innocent girls which was no part of the common object\nof the unlawful assembly. It was not necessary to kill these\ngirls  to accomplish their object of killing PW 6  as  these\ntwo  girls  had not prevented them from reaching PW  6.\t The\nlearned counsel for the accused, therefore, rightly  submit-\nted  that  while accused Nos. 1 and 2 can  be  punished\t for\ntheir  individual  acts committed after\t the  common  object\nstood  frustrated  and\tabandoned on PW\t 6  placing  himself\nbeyond their reach, the other members of the unlawful assem-\nbly could not be punished for the acts of accused Nos. 1 and\n2  as  the killing of the girls was no part  of\t the  common\nobject of the assembly. Once PW 6was beyond the reach of his\ntwo  tormenters, the common object to kill him\tstood  frus-\ntrated\tand whatever the individual members  did  thereafter\ncould  not be said to have been done in prosecution  of\t the\ncommon\tobject of the assembly. It is not the  intention  of\nthe  legislature  in enacting <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_102\">Section 149</a>  to  render  every\nmember\tof  an unlawful assembly liable\t to  punishment\t for\nevery  offence committed by one or more of its\tmembers.  In\norder  to invoke <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_103\">Section 149</a> it must be shown that  the\t in-\ncriminating act was done to accomplish the common object  of\nthe  unlawful  assembly. Even if an act\t incidental  to\t the\ncommon\tObject is committed to accomplish the common  object\nof the unlawful assembly it must be within the knowledge  of\nother  members as one likely to be committed in\t prosecution\nof  .the common object. If the members of the assembly\tknew\nor  were  aware of the likelihood of  a\t particular  offence\nbeing  committed  in prosecution of the common\tobject\tthey\nwould be liable for the same\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">511</span>\nunder <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_104\">Section 149</a>, I.P.C. In the instant case, however,\t the\nmembers\t constituting the unlawful assembly had gone to\t the\nhouse of PW 6 to kill him. That was the common object of the\nunlawful  assembly. For accomplishing that common object  it\nwas  not  necessary to kill the two girls who  were  not  an\nhinderance  to\taccused\t Nos. 1 and  2\taccomplishing  their\ncommon\tobject. We are, therefore, of the opinion  that\t ac-\ncused  Nos.  3\tto 6 cannot be convicted  for  the  injuries\ncaused\tto the two minor girls by accused Nos. 1 and 2\twith\nthe aid of <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_105\">Section 149</a>, I.P.C. We, therefore, set aside\t the\nconviction  under  <a href=\"/doc/1540253/\" id=\"a_106\">Section  326</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_107\">149</a>, I.P.C.,  and  also\t the\nsentence  imposed on accused Nos. 3 to 6 on that count.\t We,\nhowever, hold accused Nos. 3 and 4 guilty under <a href=\"/doc/162506/\" id=\"a_108\">Sections 447</a>\nand  <a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_109\">148</a>, I.P.C., and confirm the sentences awarded to\tthem\non those counts. So also we hold accused Nos. 5 and 6 guilty\nunder <a href=\"/doc/162506/\" id=\"a_110\">Sections 447</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1258372/\" id=\"a_111\">147</a>, IPC and confirm their  sentences\nfor the said offences.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_18\">    Having  come to the conclusion that Allauddin  Mian\t and\nKeyambuddin Mian are guilty of murder, the next question  is\nwhat  punishment should be awarded to them, namely,  whether\nextinction  of life or incarceration for life. <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_112\">Section\t302</a>,\nIPC casts a heavy duty on the Court to choose between  death\nand imprisonment for life. When the Court is called upon  to\nchoose\tbetween\t the convicts cry &#x27;I want to live&#x27;  and\t the\nprosecutor&#x27;s  demand  &#x27;he deserves to die&#x27; it  goes  without\nsaying that the Court must show a high degree of concern and\nsensitiveness  in  the choice of sentence.  In\tour  justice\ndelivery system several difficult decisions are left to\t the\npresiding  officers, sometimes without providing the  scales\nor  the weights for the same. In cases of  murder,  however,\nsince  the  choice is between capital  punishment  and\tlife\nimprisonment the legislature has provided a guideline in the\nform of Subsection (3) of <a href=\"/doc/203036/\" id=\"a_113\">Section 354</a> of the Code of  Crimi-\nnal Procedure, 1973 (&quot;the Code&quot;) which reads as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">\t      &quot;When the conviction for an offence is punish-\n\t      able  with death or, in the alternative,\twith\n\t      imprisonment  for life or imprisonment  for  a\n\t      term  of years, the judgment shall  state\t the\n\t      reasons for the sentence awarded, and, in\t the\n\t      case of sentence of death, the special reasons\n\t      for such sentence.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_19\">This  provision makes it obligatory in cases  of  conviction\nfor  an offence punishable with death or  with\timprisonment\nfor  life or for a term of years to assign reasons .in\tsup-\nport  of  the sentence awarded to the  convict\tand  further\nordains\t that  in case the Judge awards the  death  penalty,\n&quot;special reasons&quot; for such sentence shall be stated in the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">512</span>\njudgment.  When the law casts a duty on the Judge  to  state\nreasons\t it follows that he is under a legal  obligation  to\nexplain his choice of the sentence. It may seem trite to say\nso, but the existence of the &#x27;special reasons clause&#x27; in the\nabove  provision  implies that the Court can  in  fit  cases\nimpose\tthe  extreme penalty of death  which  negatives\t the\ncontention  that there never can be a valid reason to  visit\nan  offender  with the death penalty, no matter\t how  cruel,\ngruesome or shocking the crime may be. Basing his submission\non  what  is described as the humanitarian ideology  or\t the\nrehabilitarian\tphilosophy, Mr. Garg submitted that any\t law\nwhich permits the supreme right to life being sacrificed for\nthe  failure  of the State to establish a  social  order  in\nwhich  such crimes are not committed must be struck down  as\noffending <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_114\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_115\">, 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_116\">21</a> of the Constitution.  While\nrejecting  the demand of the protagonist of the\t reformatory\ntheory\tfor the abolition of the death penalty the  legisla-\nture in its wisdom thought that the &#x27;special reasons clause&#x27;\nshould\tbe a sufficient safeguard against arbitrary  imposi-\ntion of the extreme penalty. Where a sentence of severity is\nimposed, it is imperative that the Judge should indicate the\nbasis  upon which he considers a sentence of that  magnitude\njustified. Unless there are special reasons, special to\t the\nfacts  of  the particular case, which can be  catalogued  as\njustifying a severe punishment the Judge would not award the\ndeath sentence. It may be stated that if a Judge finds\tthat\nhe  is unable to explain with reasonable accuracy the  basis\nfor  selecting\tthe higher of the two sentences\t his  choice\nshould fall on the lower sentence. In all such cases the law\ncasts  an obligation on the Judge to make his  choice  after\ncarefully examining the pros and cons of each case. It\tmust\nat  once  be conceded that offenders  of  some\tparticularly\ngrossly\t brutal crimes which send tremors in  the  community\nhave  to be firmly dealt with to protect the community\tfrom\nthe  perpetrators of such crimes. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1201493\" id=\"span_12\">Where the incidence  of  a\ncertain\t crime is rapidly growing and is  assuming  menacing\nproportions, for example, acid pouring or bridge burning, it\nmay  be necessary for the Courts to award exemplary  punish-\nments  to  protect the community and to\t deter\tothers\tfrom\ncommitting such crimes. Since the legislature in its  wisdom\nthought that in some rare cases it may still be necessary to\nimpose\tthe extreme punishment of death to deter others\t and\nto  protect the society and in a given case the country,  it\nleft the choice of sentence to the judiciary with the  rider\nthat  the Judge may visit the convict with the extreme\tpun-\nishment\t provided there exist special reasons for so  doing.\nIn the face of this statutory provision which is  consistent\nwith  <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_117\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution which enjoins that\t the\npersonal liberty or life of an individual shall not be taken\nexcept according to the procedure established by law, we are\nunable to countenance counsel&#x27;s extreme submission of  death\nin no\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">513</span>\ncase.  The submission that the death penalty violates  Arti-\ncles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution was negatived by this\nCourt in <a href=\"/doc/1201493/\" id=\"a_118\">Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab</a>, [1980] 2 SCC\t684.\nMr.  Garg, however, submitted that <a href=\"/doc/1201493/\" id=\"a_119\">the said  decision</a>  needs\nre-consideration  as  the learned  Judges  constituting\t the\nmajority did not have the benefit of the views of  Bhagwati,\nJ.  who ruled to the contrary. We are not impressed by\tthis\nsubmission  for\t the simple reason that\t the  reasons  which\nprevailed with Bhagwati, J., could not have been unknown  to\nthe learned Judges constituting the majority.\n    Even a casual glance at the provisions of the Penal Code\nwill  show that the punishments have been  carefully  graded\ncorresponding with the gravity of offences; in grave  wrongs\nthe  punishments  prescribed are strict\t whereas  for  minor\noffences leniency is shown. Here again there is considerable\nroom  for manoeuvre because the choice of the punishment  is\nleft  to  the discretion of the Judge with  only  the  outer\nlimits\tstated. There are only a few cases where  a  minimum\npunishment  is prescribed. The question then is what  proce-\ndure does the Judge follow for determining the punishment to\nbe imposed in each case to fit the crime? The choice has  to\nbe made after following the procedure set out in sub-section\n(2)  of <a href=\"/doc/1986933/\" id=\"a_120\">Section 235</a> of the Code. That sub-section  reads  as\nunder:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">\t      &quot;If the accused is convicted, the Judge shall,\n\t      unless  he  proceeds in  accordance  with\t the\n\t      provisions of <a href=\"/doc/243306/\" id=\"a_121\">Section 360</a>, hear the accused on\n\t      the  question of sentence, and then pass\tsen-\n\t      tence on him according to law.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">The requirement of hearing the accused is intended to satis-\nfy  the\t rule of natural&#x27; justice. It is a  fundamental\t re-\nquirement  of  fairplay that the accused  who  was  hitherto\nconcentrating on the prosecution evidence on the question of\nguilt  should,\ton being found guilty, be asked\t if  he\t has\nanything to say or any evidence to tender on the question of\nsentence.  This is all the more necessary since\t the  Courts\nare generally required to make the choice from a wide  range\nof  discretion\tin the matter of sentencing. To\t assist\t the\nCourt in determining the correct sentence to be imposed\t the\nlegislature  introduced sub-section (2) to <a href=\"/doc/1986933/\" id=\"a_122\">Section 235</a>.\t The\nsaid provision therefore satisfies a dual purpose; it satis-\nfies the rule of natural justice by according to the accused\nan  opportunity of being heard on the question\tof  sentence\nand at the same time helps the Court to choose the  sentence\nto  be awarded. Since the provision is intended to give\t the\naccused\t an  opportunity to place before the Court  all\t the\nrelevant material having a bearing on the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">514</span>\nquestion  of sentence there can be no doubt that the  provi-\nsion is salutary and must be strictly followed. It is clear-\nly mandatory and should not be treated as a mere  formality.\nMr.  Garg  was, therefore, justified in making\ta  grievance\nthat the Trial Court actually treated it as a mere formality\nas is evident from the fact that it recorded the finding  of\nguilt  on 31st March, 1987, on the same day before  the\t ac-\ncused could absorb and overcome the shock of conviction they\nwere  asked if they had anything to say on the\tquestion  of\nsentence  and immediately thereafter the  decision  imposing\nthe  death penalty on the two accused was pronounced.  In  a\ncase  of  life\tor death as stated  earlier,  the  presiding\nofficer must show a high degree of concern for the statutory\ntight  of  the\taccused and should not treat it\t as  a\tmere\nformality  to  be crossed before making the choice  of\tsen-\ntence.\tIf  the\t choice is made, as in\tthis  case,  without\ngiving\tthe  accused an effective and  real  opportunity  to\nplace  his  antecedents,  social  and  economic\t background,\nmitigating  and extenuating circumstances, etc., before\t the\nCourt, the Court&#x27;s decision on the sentence would be vulner-\nable.  We need hardly mention that in many cases a  sentenc-\ning.decision  has far more serious consequences on  the\t of-\nfender\tand his family members than in the case of a  purely\nadministrative decision; a fortiori, therefore, the  princi-\nple  of fairplay must apply with greater vigour in the\tcase\nof  the former than the latter. An  administrative  decision\nhaving civil consequences, if taken without giving a hearing\nis generally struck down as violative of the rule of natural\njustice.  Likewise a sentencing decision taken without\tfol-\nlowing the requirements of sub-section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1986933/\" id=\"a_123\">Section 235</a> of\nthe Code in letter and spirit would also meet a similar fate\nand  may  have to be replaced by an appropriate\t order.\t The\nsentencing  court must approach the question  seriously\t and\nmust  endeavour to see that all the relevant facts and\tcir-\ncumstances  bearing on the question of sentence are  brought\non record. Only after giving due weight to the mitigating as\nwell  as the aggravating circumstances placed before it,  it\nmust pronounce the sentence. We think as a general rule\t the\nTrial  Courts should after recording the conviction  adjourn\nthe matter to a future date and call upon both the  prosecu-\ntion  as well as the defence to place the relevant  material\nbearing on the question of sentence before it and thereafter\npronounce the sentence to be imposed on the offender. In the\npresent\t case,\tas pointed out earlier, we are\tafraid\tthat\ntile  learned Trial Judge did not attach  sufficient  impor-\ntance  to  the mandatory requirement of sub-section  (2)  of\n<a href=\"/doc/1986933/\" id=\"a_124\">Section\t 235</a> of the Code. The High Court also had before  it\nonly the scanty material placed before the learned  Sessions\nJudge when it confirmed the death penalty.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">Apart from what we have said earlier, we may now proceed to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">515</span>\nconsider whether the imposition of death penalty on the\t two\naccused\t persons  found guilty of murder is  justified.\t The\nTrial  Court  has  dealt with the question  of\tsentence  in\nparagraphs  42\tto  44 of its  judgment.  The  reason  which\nweighed\t with the Trial Court is: it is one of\tthe  gravest\ncases  of  extreme  culpability in which  two  innocent\t and\nhelpless babies were butchered in a barbarous manner.  After\ntaking\tnote of the mitigating circumstances that  both\t the\noffenders  were married young men with children,  the  Trial\nCourt  found that since the murders were  committed  without\nprovocation and in cold blood there, was no room for lenien-\ncy  as the crime was so abhorrent that it shocked  the\tcon-\nscience\t of the court. The High Court while maintaining\t the\nconviction of the said two accused persons proceeded to deal\nwith the question of sentence thus:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">\t      &quot;The conviction of Allauddin Mian and Keyamud-\n\t      din  Mian having been upheld the\tquestion  is\n\t      whether  the reference should be accepted\t and\n\t      the sentence of death against them be  upheld.\n\t      In my view Allauddin Mian and Keyamuddin\tMian\n\t      have shown extreme mental depravity in causing\n\t      serious  fatal injuries to helpless  girls  of\n\t      the age of 7/8 years and 7 months. In my view,\n\t      therefore, this murder can be characterised as\n\t      rarest  of the rare cases. the extreme  mental\n\t      depravity\t exhibited  by\tAllauddin  Mian\t and\n\t      Keyamuddin  Mian impels me to uphold the\tsen-\n\t      tence imposed on Allauddin Mian and Keyamuddin\n\t      Mian   by\t the  learned  Additional   Sessions\n\t      Judge.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1201493\" id=\"span_16\">It\twill be seen from the above, that the  courts  below\nwere  considerably moved by the fact that the  victims\twere\ninnocent  and  helpless\t infants who had  not  provided\t any\nprovocation  for  the  ruthless manner in  which  they\twere\nkilled.\t No  one  can deny the fact that  the  murders\twere\nghastly. However, in order that the sentences may be proper-\nly  graded to fit the degree of gravity of each case, it  is\nnecessary  that\t the  maximum  sentence\t prescribed  by\t law\nshould,\t as  observed  in <a href=\"/doc/1201493/\" id=\"a_125\">Bachan Singh</a>&#x27;s  case\t(supra),  be\nreserved  for  &#x27;the rarest of rare&#x27; cases which\t are  of  an\nexceptional  nature.  Sentences of severity are\t imposed  to\nreflect the seriousness of the crime, to promote respect for\nthe  law,  to provide just punishment for  the\toffence,  to\nafford adequate deterrent to criminal conduct and to protect\nthe  community\tfrom further similar conduct.  It  serves  a\nthree-fold  purpose  (i) punitive (ii) deterrent  and  (iii)\nprotective.  That is why this Court in Bachan  Singh&#x27;s\tcase\nobserved  that\twhen the question of choice of\tsentence  is\nunder  consideration  the Court must not only  look  to\t the\ncrime and the victim but also the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">516</span>\ncircumstances  of the criminal and the impact of the  crime.\non  the\t community. Unless the nature of the crime  and\t the\ncircumstances of the offender reveal that the criminal is  a\nmenace to the society and the sentence of life\timprisonment\nwould be altogether inadequate, the Court should  ordinarily\nimpose the lessor punishment and not the extreme  punishment\nof  death  which should be reserved  for  exceptional  cases\nonly.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1201493\" id=\"span_18\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"545301\" id=\"span_19\">In the subsequent decision of <a href=\"/doc/545301/\" id=\"a_126\">Machhi Singh v. State of\nPunjab</a>,\t [1983] 3 SCC 470 this Court, after culling out\t the\nguidelines  <a href=\"/doc/545301/\" id=\"a_127\">laid down in</a> <a href=\"/doc/1201493/\" id=\"a_128\">Bachan Singh</a>&#x27;s case, observed\tthat\nonly  in  those exceptional cases in which the crime  is  so\nbrutal, diabolical and revolting as to shock the  collective\nconscience  of\tthe community, would it\t be  permissible  to\naward the death sentence. In the present case, unfortunately\nthe  material for choice of sentence is scanty.\t The  motive\nfor the crime is obscure, the one stated, namely, the  quar-\nrel  between two infants of both sides, does not seem to  be\ncorrect.  The killings were not for gain. The  charge  shows\nthat  the target was PW 6, the father, and not the  two\t in-\nfants. The killing of the two infants was not in the contem-\nplation\t of  any  of the accused. Both the  girls  were\t the\nvictims of the offenders&#x27; ire resulting from frustration  at\nthe  escape  of their target. There is nothing\tso  uncommon\nabout the crime as to make the case an exceptional one.\t The\nmere  fact  that infants are killed, without  more,  is\t not\nsufficient  to\tbring the case within the category  of\t&#x27;the\nrarest of rare&#x27; cases.</span></span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\">    In\tBachan\tSingh&#x27;s\t case the question  of\tlaying\tdown\nstandards for categorising cases in which the death  penalty\ncould  be  imposed was considered and it was  felt  that  it\nwould be desirable to indicate the broad guidelines consist-\nent  with <a href=\"/doc/203036/\" id=\"a_129\">section 354(3)</a> of the Code without  attempting  to\nformulate rigid standards. That was because it was felt that\nstandardisation of the sentencing process would leave little\nroom  for judicial discretion to take account of  variations\nin culpability even within the same category of cases. After\nreferring  to the aggravating circumstances (Para  202)\t and\nthe  mitigating\t circumstances\t(Para 206)  pointed  out  by\ncounsel, the Court observed that while &#x27;these ,were relevant\nfactors it would not be desirable to fetter judicial discre-\ntion. It pointed out that these factors were not  exhaustive\nand  cautioned: &#x27;courts, aided by broad illustrative  guide-\nlines  indicated by us, will discharge the onerous  function\nwith evermore scrupulous care and human concern&#x27;  consistent\nwith <a href=\"/doc/203036/\" id=\"a_130\">Section 354(3)</a> of the Code. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"545301\" id=\"span_20\">In the subsequent  decision\nin <a href=\"/doc/545301/\" id=\"a_131\">Machhi Singh</a>&#x27;s case, the Court tried to indicate the type\nof cases which may fall within the exceptional class without\nattempting  to introduce rigidity. It would not be  fair  to\nread  the decision as an attempt to fetter judicial  discre-\ntion. Even in cases of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">517</span>\ntype  indicated <a href=\"/doc/545301/\" id=\"a_132\">in that case</a>, circumstances may vary,  which\nwould  necessitate  a different approach. For  example,\t the\ncircumstances  of  this\t case show that\t the  offenders\t had\nkilled\tthe two girls not because of any hatred for them  or\nto  accomplish\ttheir objective but out of  frustration\t and\nanger  at  having lost their target.  Unfortunately  as\t the\ntrial Judge did not give time to the convicts to reflect  on\nthe question of sentence, the chance, however remote, of the\ntrue  motive for the crime surfacing was lost. The  anteced-\nents  of  the accused, their socioeconomic  conditions,\t the\nimpact\tof their crime on the community etc., have not\tcome\non record. The absence of these particulars makes the choice\nof  punishment difficult. In view of what we  have  observed\nearlier and having regard to the circumstances in which\t the\nmurders took place, we think the extreme punishment of death\nis not warranted.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_24\">    In\tthe result both the appeals are partly allowed.\t The\nconviction  of accused Nos. 1 and 2 under all the  heads  is\nconfirmed  but\ttheir sentence of death for  killing  Shahna\nKhatoon\t and Chand Tara, respectively, is converted  to\t im-\nprisonment  for\t life.\tSo far as accused Nos. 3  to  6\t are\nconcerned, their conviction and sentence under <a href=\"/doc/1540253/\" id=\"a_133\">Section\t326</a>/\n<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_134\">149</a>,  <a href=\"/doc/1873250/\" id=\"a_135\">1</a>.P.C.  is set aside; however,  their  conviction\t and\nsentence  under\t the other heads is maintained.\t Their\tbail\nbonds  will stand cancelled if they have already served\t out\ntheir sentences; otherwise they will surrender to their bail\nand serve out the remaining sentence.
