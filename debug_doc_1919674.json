A bride in her  incipient\ntwenties  was  whacked to death at her nuptial home.   After\ngagging\t her mouth the assailants treated her for some\ttime\nas a football by kicking her incessantly and thereafter as a\nhockey puck by lambasting her with truncheons until she died\nof  bilateral  tension\thaemothorax.  Her  husband  and\t his\nbrother\t and father were indicted for her murder.  But\twhen\nall the material witnesses turned hostile to the prosecution\nthe  trial  court,  being foreclosed  against  all  options,\nacquitted  them.  Undeterred by the said acquittal the State\nof  Karnataka made a venture by filing an appeal before\t the\nHigh  Court  of\t Karnataka.  A Division Bench  of  the\tHigh\nCourt,\tlooking at the factual matrix of the case,  lamented\nO  Tempora  O Mores as the learned judges said by  way\tof\nprologue  that\tit is virtually a matter of shame  that\t in\nthis  day  and date, indiscriminate attacks  and  abnormally\nhigh  degree of violence are directed against married  women\nin certain quarters and that the law is doing little to curb\nthis  type of utterly obnoxious and anti-social activities.\nLearned\t Judges after reaching a cul de sac, swerved over to\na  different offence i.e.  dowry death and convicted one  of\nthem  (the  husband) under section 304B of the Indian  penal\nCode  and awarded the maximum sentence of life\timprisonment\nprescribed  thereunder\ton  him besides\t <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_1\">Section  498A</a>\tIPC.\nHowever,  the  High court found helpless to bring the  other\ntwo accused to the dragnet of any offence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_2\">      Thus, for the appellant (husband of the deceased) this\nappeal\tbecame one of right under <a href=\"/doc/1524736/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 379</a> of the Code of\nCriminal  Procedure (for short the Code) and under Section\n2  of  Supreme\tCourt  (Enlargement  of\t Criminal  Appellate\nJurisdiction) Act, 1970.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_3\">      During  the  course  of arguments a  question  of\t law\ncropped\t up  as the appellant was not charged under  <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_3\">Section\n304B</a>, IPC.  The question raised is this:  Whether an accused\nwho  was  charged under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 302</a> IPC could  be  convicted\nalternatively  under  <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_5\">Section  304-B</a> IPC, without  the\tsaid\noffence\t being\tspecifically put in the charge.\t The  answer\nappeared,  at the first blush, ingenuous particularly in the\nlight  of  <a href=\"/doc/649942/\" id=\"a_6\">Section  221</a> of the Code.  But  as  we  proceeded\nfurther\t  we  noticed  that   the  question  has   intricate\ndimensions,  more so when this Court held divergent views on\ntwo  occasions though not on the identical point.  This case\nwas,  however,\treferred to be heard by a larger  Bench\t and\nthus it came up before a bench of three judges.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">      To  assist  us  in this matter we appointed  Sri\tUday\nUmesh  Lalit,  advocate\t as  amicus  curiae.   He  with\t his\nmeritorious  efforts helped us considerably in the task.  We\nare beholden to him for the assistance rendered to us.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">      Before  we  proceed  to  the question  of\t law  it  is\nnecessary  to delineate the synopsis of the case.  The bride\nwas Tanima, whose marriage with the appellant was solemnized\nonly  a few months prior to her tragic end.  It appears that\nTanimas\t father\t had died much earlier.\t A certain  amount,\nnot  much,  was given to the bridegroom at the time  of\t the\nmarriage,  though the expenses of the wedding were borne  by\nthe  brides  people.   After marriage Tanima lived  in\tthe\nhouse  of her husband for a couple of months.  But when\t she\npaid  her first visit to her natal home she reported to\t her\nmother\tand  brothers  that  she   was\tbeing  subjected  to\npressures and harassment by her husband and by the other two\naccused\t for  wangling\ta further amount  of  Rupees  twenty\nthousand  from\ther people.  She complained to\ther  brother\nthat  she was threatened that if the amount was not  brought\nshe  would  be asked to leave the nuptial home once and\t for\nall.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">      On  completion  of her furlough at her parental  house\nthe appellant went to take her back.  Then her brother (PW1-\nMahaboobsab  Ammarngi) gave a sum of rupees five thousand to\nthe  appellant and pleaded with him to be satisfied with it.\nThough\twith  displeasure, as the amount  was  insufficient,\nappellant  collected it and allowed Tanima to escort him  to\nhis  house.  A few days later Tanima conveyed to her  mother\nthat  she  was again persecuted for not making up the  whole\namount\tdemanded.  Once again appellant brought her back  to\nher parental home after subjecting her to physical assaults.\nPW1-Mahboobsab\tAmmarngi,  on being told that  the  assaults\nwere  meant  for meeting the demand for dowry, pleaded\twith\nthe  appellant\tto desist from torturing his  young  sister.\nAfter  some haggling PW1 was able to pay a sum of rupees two\nthousand  more.\t  At  that time also appellant,\t though\t not\nfully  satisfied  with the pelf given, took her back to\t his\nhouse.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">      Within  two  months thereafter Tanima was killed.\t  On\nhearing\t the  news on 17.10.1992 PW1 along with some of\t his\nclose  relatives set out to the house of the appellant.\t  On\nthe way they met the appellant.\t When they tried to confront\nhim  with what they heard he skirted the subject and slipped\naway.  When they reached the house of the appellant they saw\nthe mangled dead body of Tanima.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">      Dr.   Tawaraj (PW7) conducted the autopsy on the\tdead\nbody  of  Tanima.  Though externally there were only  a\t few\nabrasions  and\tcontusions the inside was found\t very  badly\nmauled.\t  The rib on the right side was fractured, both\t the\nlungs  were collapsed, the thorasic cavity contained 200 ml.\nof  blood.   The peritoneum was soaked in blood,  liver\t and\nspleen\twere  massively\t lacerated  and\t ruptured  at  three\nplaces.\t  Though  prosecution examined PW3 and PW4 who\twere\nneighbours to say that they saw the three accused inflicting\nincessant  assaults  on Tanima and PW6 was examined  to\t say\nthat  appellant\t made an extra-judicial confession  to\thim,\nthey  all  turned hostile and did not speak  as\t prosecution\nexpected.   The\t remaining  evidence was not  sufficient  to\nestablish  that all or any of the accused had inflicted\t the\ninjuries  on  Tanima.  Consequently, prosecution  failed  to\nprove  that  the accused caused the death of  the  deceased.\nThe  trial court did not make any other endeavour and  hence\nfound the accused not guilty and acquitted them.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\">      Learned  Judges of the High Court found that there  is\nno  evidence  against  A-2 Meerasaheb Karim  Saheb  and\t A-3\nMahaboom   Meerasaheb.\t  However,  in\t the  case  of\t A-1\n(appellant)  the Division Bench was in confusion as it found\nthat  prosecution proved beyond all reasonable doubt that it\nwas  appellant\twho killed Tanima.  The relevant portion  of\nparagraph 14 of the judgment of the Division Bench delivered\nby  Saldana, J, is extracted below:  We hold that there\t is\nsufficient  direct and circumstantial evidence in this\tcase\nto   prove  beyond  all\t reasonable   doubt  that  A-1\t was\nresponsible  for  tying deceased Tanima and  assaulting\t her\nwith  the metal rod as also brutally and mercilessly kicking\nher  in the course of this assault all of which resulted  in\nher death.  The nature of the incident and the fact that she\nsuccumbed  to  the  cruelty would clearly  bring  this\tcase\nwithin the ambit of <a href=\"/doc/409589/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 304</a> IPC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_10\">      But  the operative portion of the judgment reads thus:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">The  appeal  partially\tsucceeds.  The order  of  acquittal\npassed\tin  favour  of original accused Nos.2 and  3  stands\nconfirmed.   As\t far  as  the\toriginal  accused  No.1\t  is\nconcerned,  the\t order of acquittal passed in his favour  by\nthe  Trial Court is set aside.\tA-1 stands convicted of\t the\noffence\t punishable under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 498-A</a> IPC and is sentenced\nto  RI\tfor  3 years.  He is also convicted of\tthe  offence\npunishable  under  <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 304-B</a> IPC and is sentenced to  RI\nfor life, substantive sentence to run concurrently.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">      Initially\t we thought that there might have been\tsome\ntypographical  or other errors in the above first  extracted\nportion\t of the judgment produced before us but we found the\nsaid portion remaining the same even in the judgment sent up\nby  the\t High Court along with the records.  We may take  it\nthat  learned  Judges did not intend to speak what  is\tseen\nrecorded  in  the  paragraph 14 of the\tjudgment  (extracted\nabove)\tand that the High Court only proposed to convict the\nappellant  under <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_10\">Sections 304-B</a> and <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_11\">498-A</a> IPC.\tBut even  on\nthat  aspect  Saldana,\tJ,  made an  observation  which\t is,\nunfortunately, not true to facts.  That observation is this:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">Coming\tto the charge under <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 304-B</a> IPC, this section\nwas incorporated in the year 1986 by the legislature for the\npurpose\t of dealing with instances of dowry death.  Counsel\nfor  both sides submitted that no charge was framed  against\nthe  accused  for the offence under <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 304-B</a>  IPC.\t  We\nperused the original charge framed by the Sessions Court and\nnoticed\t that there was no such count included in the charge\nat  all.   If so, we may say, euphemistically, that  learned\nJudges\tcommitted  a serious error in assuming that  <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_14\">Section\n304-B</a>  IPC  was\t included in the charge framed\tagainst\t the\nappellant.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">      Be  that as it may.  The question raised before us  is\nwhether\t in  a\tcase where prosecution failed to  prove\t the\ncharge\tunder  <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_15\">Section\t302</a>  IPC,   but\t on  the  facts\t the\ningredients  of <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_16\">section 304-B</a> have winched to the fore,\t can\nthe  court convict him of that offence in the absence of the\nsaid offence being included in the charge.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">      <a href=\"/doc/649942/\" id=\"a_17\">Sections\t221</a>  and  <a href=\"/doc/384218/\" id=\"a_18\">222</a>  of   the\t Code  are  the\t two\nprovisions  dealing  with the power of a criminal  court  to\nconvict\t the accused of an offence which is not included  in\nthe  charge.   The  primary  condition\tfor  application  of\n<a href=\"/doc/649942/\" id=\"a_19\">section\t 221</a> of the Code is that the court should have\tfelt\ndoubt, at the time of framing the charge, as to which of the\nseveral\t acts  (which  may be proved)  will  constitute\t the\noffence\t on  account of the nature of the acts or series  of\nacts  alleged  against\tthe  accused.  In such\ta  case\t the\nsection\t permits to convict the accused of the offence\tof\nwhich  he  is  shown  to have committed though\the  was\t not\ncharged\t with it. But in the nature of the acts alleged\t by\nthe  prosecution in this case there was absolutely no  scope\nfor  any doubt regarding the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 302</a>\tIPC,\nat least at the time of framing the charge.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">      <a href=\"/doc/384218/\" id=\"a_21\">Section  222(1)</a> of the Code deals with a case when  a\nperson\tis  charged  with an offence consisting\t of  several\nparticulars.   The Section permits the court to convict the\naccused\t of  the minor offence, though he was  not  charged\nwith it. Sub-section (2) deals with a similar, but slightly\ndifferent,  situation.\t When a person is charged  with\t an\noffence\t and  facts  are proved which reduce it to  a  minor\noffence,  he may be convicted of the minor offence  although\nhe is not charged with it.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">      What  is meant by a minor offence for the purpose of\n<a href=\"/doc/384218/\" id=\"a_22\">Section\t 222</a>  of the Code?  Although the said expression  is\nnot defined in the Code it can be discerned from the context\nthat  the  test\t of  minor offence is not  merely  that\t the\nprescribed  punishment is less than the major offence.\t The\ntwo  illustrations  provided in the section would bring\t the\nabove point home well.\tOnly if the two offences are cognate\noffences,  wherein the main ingredients are common, the\t one\npunishable among them with a lesser sentence can be regarded\nas minor offence vis-à-vis the other offence.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">      The composition of the offence under <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 304-B</a> IPC\nis  vastly  different from the formation of the\t offence  of\nmurder\tunder <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 302</a> IPC and hence the former cannot be\nregarded  as  minor offence vis-à-vis the latter.   However,\nthe  position  would  be  different  when  the\tcharge\talso\ncontains  the  offence under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 498-A</a> IPC\t(Husband  or\nrelative  of husband of a women subjecting her to  cruelty).\nAs the word cruelty is explained as including, inter alia,\nharassment  of\tthe woman where such harassment is  with  a\nview  to  coercing her or any person related to her to\tmeet\nany unlawful demand for any property or valuable security or\nis on account of failure by her or any person related to her\nto meet such demand.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">      So  when\ta  person is charged with an  offence  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_26\">Sections  302</a> and <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_27\">498-A</a> IPC on the allegation that he caused\nthe death of a bride after subjecting her to harassment with\na  demand for dowry, within a period of 7 years of marriage,\na  situation may arise, as in this case, that the offence of\nmurder\t is   not  established\tas  against   the   accused.\nNonetheless  all other ingredients necessary for the offence\nunder  <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_28\">Section\t304-B</a> IPC would stand established.  Can\t the\naccused\t be  convicted in such a case for the offence  under\n<a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_29\">Section\t 304-B</a> IPC without the said offence forming part  of\nthe charge?\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">      A two Judge Bench of this Court (K.  Jayachandra Reddy\nand  G.N.  Ray, JJ) has held in Lakhjit Singh and anr.\t vs.\nState  of  Punjab  {1994  Supple.  (1) SCC 173}\t that  if  a\nprosecution  failed  to establish the offence under  <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_30\">Section\n302</a>  IPC, which alone was included in the charge, but if the\noffence\t under <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 306</a> IPC was made out in the  evidence\nit  is\tpermissible for the court to convict the accused  of\nthe latter offence.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_11\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1639002\" id=\"span_1\">But  without reference to the above decision,  another\ntwo  Judge  Bench  of this Court (M.K.\tMukherjee  and\tS.P.\nKurdukar,  JJ) has held in <a href=\"/doc/1639002/\" id=\"a_32\">Sangaraboina Sreenu vs.  State of\nA.P.</a>   {1997 (5) SCC 348} that it is impermissible to do so.\nThe  rationale advanced by the Bench for the above  position\nis  this:   It is true that <a href=\"/doc/384218/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 222</a> CrP.C.\tentitles  a\ncourt  to  convict a person of an offence which is minor  in\ncomparison  to the one for which he is tried but <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 306</a>\nIPC  cannot be said to be a minor offence in relation to  an\noffence\t under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 302</a> IPC within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/1176662/\" id=\"a_36\">Section\n222</a>  Cr.P.C.   for  the\t two offences are  of  distinct\t and\ndifferent  categories.\t While the basic constituent  of  an\noffence\t under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 302</a> IPC is homicidal death, those  of\n<a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 306</a> IPC are suicidal death and abetment thereof.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">      The  crux\t of  the  matter is this:   Would  there  be\noccasion  for a failure of justice by adopting such a course\nas  to convict an accused of the offence under <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_39\">Section\t304B</a>\nIPC  when all the ingredients necessary for the said offence\nhave  come out in evidence, although he was not charged with\nthe  said  offence?  In this context a reference to  <a href=\"/doc/1745798/\" id=\"a_40\">Section\n464(1)</a>\tof  the Code is apposite:  No finding, sentence\t or\norder  by a Court of competent jurisdiction shall be  deemed\ninvalid merely on the ground that no charge was framed or on\nthe  ground  of any error, omission or irregularity  in\t the\ncharge\tincluding any misjoinder of charges, unless, in\t the\nopinion\t of the Court of appeal, confirmation or revision, a\nfailure\t of  justice has in fact been  occasioned  thereby.\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n      In  other\t words, a conviction would be valid even  if\nthere  is  any\tomission  or  irregularity  in\tthe  charge,\nprovided it did not occasion a failure of justice.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">      We  often\t hear about failure of justice\tand  quite\noften the submission in a criminal court is accentuated with\nthe said expression.  Perhaps it is too pliable or facile an\nexpression which could be fitted in any situation of a case.\nThe expression failure of justice would appear, sometimes,\nas  an\tetymological chameleon (The simile is borrowed\tfrom\nLord  Diplock  in Town Investments Ltd.\t vs.  Department  of\nthe  Environment  {1977(1)  All England\t Report\t 813}.\t The\ncriminal  court, particularly the superior court should make\na  close examination to ascertain whether there was really a\nfailure of justice or whether it is only a camouflage.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">      One  of the cardinal principles of natural justice  is\nthat  no man should be condemned without being heard, (Audi\nalterum\t partem).   But\t the law reports are  replete  with\ninstances  of  courts hesitating to approve  the  contention\nthat  failure  of  justice had occasioned merely  because  a\nperson\twas  not heard on a particular aspect.\tHowever,  if\nthe  aspect  is of such a nature that non-explanation of  it\nhas  contributed  to  penalising an  individual,  the  court\nshould\tsay  that since he was not given the opportunity  to\nexplain\t that aspect there was failure of justice on account\nof non-compliance with the principle of natural justice.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_15\">      We have now to examine whether, on the evidence now on\nrecord\tthe  appellant can be convicted under <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_41\">Section  304-B</a>\nIPC without the same being included as a count in the charge\nframed.\t  <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 304-B</a> has been brought on the statute book\non  9-11-1986  as a package along with <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 113-B</a> of\t the\nEvidence  Act.\t <a href=\"/doc/98282/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 304-B(1)</a> IPC reads  thus:   304-B.\nDowry  death.-\t(1) Where the death of a woman is caused  by\nany  burns  or bodily injury or occurs otherwise than  under\nnormal\tcircumstances within seven years of her marriage and\nit  is shown that soon before her death she was subjected to\ncruelty\t or harassment by her husband or any relative of her\nhusband\t for,  or in connection with, any demand for  dowry,\nsuch  death shall be called dowry death, and such  husband\nor relative shall be deemed to have caused her death.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_16\">      In  the Explanation to the Section it is said that the\nword  dowry  shall be understood as defined in\tthe  <a href=\"/doc/1763444/\" id=\"a_45\">Dowry\nProhibition Act, 1961</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">      The  postulates  needed to establish the said  offence\nare:   (1)  Death of a wife should have\t occurred  otherwise\nthan  under  normal circumstances within seven years of\t her\nmarriage;   (2)\t soon before her death she should have\tbeen\nsubjected  to  cruelty\tor  harassment\tby  the\t accused  in\nconnection  with any demand for dowry.\tNow reading  <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_46\">section\n113B</a> of the Evidence Act, as a part of the said offence, the\nposition  is  this:  If the prosecution succeeds in  showing\nthat  soon  before  her death she was subjected\t by  him  to\ncruelty\t or harassment for or in connection with any  demand\nfor  dowry  and\t that her death had occurred  (within  seven\nyears\tof  her\t marriage)   otherwise\tthan  under   normal\ncircumstances  the court shall presume that such person had\ncaused dowry death.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_18\">      Under  <a href=\"/doc/750738/\" id=\"a_47\">Section  4</a> of the Evidence Act whenever it\t is\ndirected  by this Act that the Court shall presume the\tfact\nit  shall regard such fact as proved unless and until it  is\ndisproved.  So the court has no option but to presume  that\nthe  accused  had  caused  dowry death\tunless\tthe  accused\ndisproves  it.\t It is a statutory compulsion on the  court.\nHowever\t it  is open to the accused to adduce such  evidence\nfor  disproving\t the  said compulsory  presumption,  as\t the\nburden\tis  unmistakably on him to do so.  He can  discharge\nsuch  burden  either  by eliciting  answers  through  cross-\nexamination  of\t the  witnesses\t of the\t prosecution  or  by\nadducing evidence on the defence side or by both.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_19\">      At this stage, we may note the difference in the legal\nposition  between the said offence and <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_48\">section 306</a> IPC which\nwas  merely an offence of abetment of suicide earlier.\t The\nsection\t remained in the statute book without any  practical\nuse  till 1983.\t But by the introduction of Section 113A  in\nthe  <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_49\">Evidence Act</a> the said offence under <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_50\">Section 306</a> IPC has\nacquired wider dimensions and has become a serious marriage-\nrelated offence.  <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 113A</a> of the Evidence Act says that\nunder  certain conditions, almost similar to the  conditions\nfor  dowry death the court may presume having regard to the\ncircumstances  of  the\tcase,  that such  suicide  has\tbeen\nabetted\t by  her  husband etc. When the law says  that\tthe\ncourt  may presume the fact, it is discretionary on the part\nof  the court either to regard such fact as proved or not to\ndo so, which depends upon all the other circumstances of the\ncase.\tAs there is no compulsion on the court to act on the\npresumption  the  accused  can persuade\t the  court  against\ndrawing a presumption adverse to him.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">      But  the\tpeculiar situation in respect of an  offence\nunder  <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 304B</a> IPC, as discernible from the distinction\npointed\t out  above in respect of the offence under  <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_53\">Section\n306</a> IPC is this:  Under the former the court has a statutory\ncompulsion,  merely  on\t the establishment  of\ttwo  factual\npositions  enumerated above, to presume that the accused has\ncommitted  dowry death.\t If any accused wants to escape from\nthe  said catch the burden is on him to disprove it.  If  he\nfails  to rebut the presumption the court is bound to act on\nit.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_21\">      Now take the case of an accused who was called upon to\ndefend\tonly a charge under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_54\">Section 302</a> IPC.  The burden  of\nproof  never  shifts  on  to him.  It ever  remains  on\t the\nprosecution  which  has\t to  prove  the\t charge\t beyond\t all\nreasonable  doubt.   The  said\t traditional  legal  concept\nremains\t unchanged even now.  In such a case the accused can\nwait  till the prosecution evidence is over and then to show\nthat the prosecution has failed to make out the said offence\nagainst\t him.\tNo  compulsory presumption would go  to\t the\nassistance  of the prosecution in such a situation.  If that\nbe  so,\t when an accused has no notice of the offence  under\n<a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 304B</a> IPC, as he was defending a charge under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_56\">Section\n302</a>  IPC alone, would it not lead to a grave miscarriage  of\njustice\t when  he is alternatively convicted  under  <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_57\">Section\n304B</a>  IPC and sentenced to the serious punishment prescribed\nthereunder,   which   mandates\t a   minimum   sentence\t  of\nimprisonment for seven years.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">      The serious consequence which may ensue to the accused\nin  such a situation can be limned through an illustration:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">If  a bride was murdered within seven years of her  marriage\nand  there was evidence to show that either on the  previous\nday  or\t a  couple  of days earlier  she  was  subjected  to\nharassment  by\ther  husband  with demand  for\tdowry,\tsuch\nhusband\t would\tbe guilty of the offence on the language  of\n<a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_58\">Section\t 304-B</a>\tIPC read with <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_59\">Section 113-B</a> of the  Evidence\nAct.   But if the murder of his wife was actually  committed\neither\tby a decoit or by a militant in a terrorist act\t the\nhusband can lead evidence to show that he had no hand in her\ndeath  at all.\tIf he succeeds in discharging the burden  of\nproof  he is not liable to be convicted under <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_60\">Section  304B</a>,\nIPC.   But if the husband is charged only under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_61\">Section\t 302</a>\nIPC  he\t has no burden to prove that his wife  was  murdered\nlike  that  as he can have his traditional defence that\t the\nprosecution has failed to prove the charge of murder against\nhim and claim an order of acquittal.  The above illustration\nwould  amplify\tthe gravity of the consequence befalling  an\naccused\t if  he\t was  only asked to defend  a  charge  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_62\">Section\t 302</a>  IPC  and\twas  alternatively  convicted  under\n<a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_63\">Section\t 304B</a>  IPC without any notice to him, because he  is\ndeprived  of the opportunity to disprove the burden cast  on\nhim by law.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">      In such a situation, if the trial court finds that the\nprosecution  has  failed to make out the case under  <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_64\">Section\n302</a>  IPC,  but the offence under <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_65\">Section 304-B</a> IPC has\tbeen\nmade out, the court has to call upon the accused to enter on\nhis  defence  in  respect  of  the  said  offence.   Without\naffording  such an opportunity to the accused, a  conviction\nunder  <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_66\">Section\t304-B</a>  IPC would lead to  real\tand  serious\nmiscarriage  of justice.  Even if no such count was included\nin  the charge, when the court affords him an opportunity to\ndischarge  his burden by putting him to notice regarding the\nprima  facie  view  of\tthe court that he is  liable  to  be\nconvicted  under  <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_67\">Section  304B</a> IPC, unless he\tsucceeds  in\ndisproving  the presumption, it is possible for the court to\nenter  upon a conviction of the said offence in the event of\nhis failure to disprove the presumption.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_23\">      As the appellant was convicted by the High Court under\n<a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_68\">Section 304-B</a> IPC, without such opportunity being granted to\nhim,  we  deem\tit necessary in the interest of\t justice  to\nafford\thim  that opportunity.\tThe case in the trial  court\nshould\tproceed against the appellant (not against the other\ntwo  accused whose acquittal remains unchallenged now)\tfrom\nthe  stage  of defence evidence.  He is put to\tnotice\tthat\nunless\the  disproves  the presumption, he is liable  to  be\nconvicted  under <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_69\">section 304-B</a> IPC.  To facilitate the trial\ncourt to dispose of the case afresh against the appellant in\nthe  manner indicated above, we set aside the conviction and\nsentence passed on him by the High Court and remand the case\nto the trial court.\n</p>\n\n\n\n",
