That in view of the compromise and\n\nthe stand taken by the complainant, considering the decision of this\n\nCourt in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1282121/\" id=\"a_34\">Shiji</a> (supra), the High Court has observed that\n\nthere is no chance of recording conviction against the accused persons\n\nand the entire exercise of a trial would be exercise in futility, the High\n\nCourt has quashed the FIR.</span>\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">\f                                    9</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\">\n\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"192124141\" id=\"span_30\">9.1       However, the High Court has not at all considered the fact\n\nthat the offences alleged were non-compoundable offences as per\n\n<a href=\"/doc/91933/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 320</a> of the Cr.P.C. From the impugned judgment and order, it\n\nappears that the High Court has not at all considered the relevant\n\nfacts and circumstances of the case, more particularly the seriousness\n\nof the offences and its social impact. From the impugned judgment\n\nand order passed by the High Court, it appears that the High Court\n\nhas mechanically quashed the FIR, in exercise of its powers under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C.    The High Court has not at all considered the\n\ndistinction between a personal or private wrong and a social wrong\n\nand the social impact. As observed by this Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/192124141/\" id=\"a_37\">State\n\nof Maharashtra vs. Vikram Anantrai Doshi</a>, (2014) 15 SCC 29, the\n\nCourt’s principal duty, while exercising the powers under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 482</a>\n\nCr.P.C. to quash the criminal proceedings, should be to scan the\n\nentire facts to find out the thrust of the allegations and the crux of the\n\nsettlement. As observed, it is the experience of the Judge that comes\n\nto his aid and the said experience should be used with care, caution,\n\ncircumspection and courageous prudence. In the case at hand, the\n\nHigh Court has not at all taken pains to scrutinise the entire\n\nconspectus of facts in proper perspective and has quashed the\n\ncriminal proceedings mechanically. Even, the quashing of the FIR by\n\nthe High Court in the present case for the offences under <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_39\">Sections 307</a>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">\f                                  <a href=\"/doc/1980183/\" id=\"a_40\">10</a></span>\n\nand <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_41\">34</a> of the IPC, and that too in exercise of powers under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_42\">Section\n\n482</a> of the Cr.P.C. is just contrary to the law <a href=\"/doc/192124141/\" id=\"a_43\">laid down by</a> this Court\n\nin a catena of decisions.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"69949024\" id=\"span_32\">9.2       In the case of <a href=\"/doc/69949024/\" id=\"a_44\">Gian Singh</a> (supra), in paragraph 61, this\n\nCourt has observed and held as under:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">        “61. The position that emerges from the above discussion\n        can be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in\n        quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in\n        exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and\n        different from the power given to a criminal court for\n        compounding the offences under <a href=\"/doc/895891/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 320</a> of the Code.\n        Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory\n        limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the\n        guideline engrafted in such power viz.: (i) to secure the\n        ends of justice, or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of\n        any court. In what cases power to quash the criminal\n        proceeding or complaint or FIR may be exercised where\n        the offender and the victim have settled their dispute\n        would depend on the facts and circumstances of each\n        case and no category can be prescribed. However, before\n        exercise of such power, the High Court must have due\n        regard to the nature and gravity of the crime. Heinous\n        and serious offences of mental depravity or offences like\n        murder, rape, dacoity, etc. cannot be fittingly quashed\n        even though the victim or victim’s family and the offender\n        have settled the dispute. Such offences are not private in\n        nature and have a serious impact on society. Similarly,\n        any compromise between the victim and the offender in\n        relation to the offences under special statutes like the\n        <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_46\">Prevention of Corruption Act</a> or the offences committed by\n        public servants while working in that capacity, etc.;\n        cannot provide for any basis for quashing criminal\n        proceedings involving such offences. But the criminal\n        cases having overwhelmingly and predominatingly civil\n        flavour stand on a different footing for the purposes of\n        quashing, particularly the offences arising from\n        commercial, financial, mercantile, civil, partnership or\n        such like transactions or the offences arising out of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">\f                                 11</span>\n\n       matrimony relating to dowry, etc. or the family disputes\n       where the wrong is basically private or personal in nature\n       and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this\n       category of cases, the High Court may quash the criminal\n       proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise\n       between the offender and the victim, the possibility of\n       conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of the\n       criminal case would put the accused to great oppression\n       and prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to\n       him by not quashing the criminal case despite full and\n       complete settlement and compromise with the victim. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"69949024\" id=\"span_34\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"160278245\" id=\"span_35\">In\n       other words, the High Court must consider whether it\n       would be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice to\n       continue with the criminal proceeding or continuation of\n       the criminal proceeding would tantamount to abuse of\n       process of law despite settlement and compromise\n       between the victim and the wrongdoer and whether to\n       secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that the\n       criminal case is put to an end and if the answer to the\n       above question(s) is in the affirmative, the High Court\n       shall be well within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal\n       proceeding.”\n\n\n9.3      In the case of <a href=\"/doc/160278245/\" id=\"a_47\">Narinder Singh vs. State of Punjab</a> (2014) 6\n\nSCC 466, after considering the decision in the case of <a href=\"/doc/69949024/\" id=\"a_48\">Gian Singh</a>\n\n(supra), in paragraph 29, this Court summed up as under:</span></span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">       “29. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we sum up and\n       lay down the following principles by which the High Court\n       would be guided in giving adequate treatment to the\n       settlement between the parties and exercising its power\n       under Section 482 of the Code while accepting the\n       settlement and quashing the proceedings or refusing to\n       accept the settlement with direction to continue with the\n       criminal proceedings:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">       29.1. Power conferred under Section 482 of the Code is to\n       be distinguished from the power which lies in the Court to\n       compound the offences under Section 320 of the Code. No\n       doubt, under Section 482 of the      Code, the High Court\n       has inherent power to quash the criminal proceedings\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">\f                          12</span>\n\neven in those cases which are not compoundable, where\nthe parties have settled the matter between themselves.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">However, this power is to be exercised sparingly and with\ncaution.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\">29.2. When the parties have reached the settlement and\non that basis petition for quashing the criminal\nproceedings is filed, the guiding factor in such cases\nwould be to secure:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">     (i) ends of justice, or\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">     (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any court.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_27\">While exercising the power the High Court is to form an\nopinion on either of the aforesaid two objectives.\n29.3. Such a power is not to be exercised in those\nprosecutions which involve heinous and serious offences\nof mental depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity,\netc. Such offences are not private in nature and have a\nserious impact on society. Similarly, for the offences\nalleged to have been committed under special statute like\nthe <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_49\">Prevention of Corruption Act</a> or the offences\ncommitted by public servants while working in that\ncapacity are not to be quashed merely on the basis of\ncompromise between the victim and the offender.\n29.4. On the other hand, those criminal cases having\noverwhelmingly and predominantly civil character,\nparticularly those arising out of commercial transactions\nor arising out of matrimonial relationship or family\ndisputes should be quashed when the parties have\nresolved their entire disputes among themselves.\n29.5. While exercising its powers, the High Court is to\nexamine as to whether the possibility of conviction is\nremote and bleak and continuation of criminal cases\nwould put the accused to great oppression and prejudice\nand extreme injustice would be caused to him by not\nquashing the criminal cases.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_28\">29.6. Offences under <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_50\">Section 307</a> IPC would fall in the\ncategory of heinous and serious offences and therefore are\nto be generally treated as crime against the society and\nnot against the individual alone. However, the High Court\nwould not rest its decision merely because there is a\nmention of <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 307</a> IPC in the FIR or the charge is\nframed under this provision. It would be open to the High\nCourt to examine as to whether incorporation of <a href=\"/doc/86648814/\" id=\"a_52\">Section\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">\f                           13</span></a>\n\n<a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_53\">307</a> IPC is there for the sake of it or the prosecution has\ncollected sufficient evidence, which if proved, would lead\nto proving the charge under <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_54\">Section 307</a> IPC. For this\npurpose, it would be open to the High Court to go by the\nnature of injury sustained, whether such injury is\ninflicted on the vital/delegate parts of the body, nature of\nweapons used, etc. Medical report in respect of injuries\nsuffered by the victim can generally be the guiding factor.\nOn the basis of this prima facie analysis, the High Court\ncan examine as to whether there is a strong possibility of\nconviction or the chances of conviction are remote and\nbleak. In the former case it can refuse to accept the\nsettlement and quash the criminal proceedings whereas\nin the latter case it would be permissible for the High\nCourt to accept the plea compounding the offence based\non complete settlement between the parties. At this stage,\nthe Court can also be swayed by the fact that the\nsettlement between the parties is going to result in\nharmony between them which may improve their future\nrelationship.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_29\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7293093\" id=\"span_38\">29.7. While deciding whether to exercise its power under\nSection 482 of the Code or not, timings of settlement play\na crucial role. Those cases where the settlement is\narrived at immediately after the alleged commission of\noffence and the matter is still under investigation, the\nHigh Court may be liberal in accepting the settlement to\nquash the criminal proceedings/investigation. It is\nbecause of the reason that at this stage the investigation\nis still on and even the charge-sheet has not been filed.\nLikewise, those cases where the charge is framed but the\nevidence is yet to start or the evidence is still at infancy\nstage, the High Court can show benevolence in exercising\nits powers favourably, but after prima facie assessment of\nthe circumstances/material mentioned above. On the\nother hand, where the prosecution evidence is almost\ncomplete or after the conclusion of the evidence the\nmatter is at the stage of argument, normally the High\nCourt should refrain from exercising its power under\nSection 482 of the Code, as in such cases the trial court\nwould be in a position to decide the case finally on merits\nand to come to a conclusion as to whether the offence\nunder <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 307</a> IPC is committed or not. Similarly, in\nthose cases where the conviction is already recorded by\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">\f                                  14</span>\n\n        the trial court and the matter is at the appellate stage\n        before the High Court, mere compromise between the\n        parties would not be a ground to accept the same\n        resulting in acquittal of the offender who has already\n        been convicted by the trial court. Here charge is proved\n        under <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_56\">Section 307</a> IPC and conviction is already recorded\n        of a heinous crime and, therefore, there is no question of\n        sparing a convict found guilty of such a crime.”\n\n\n9.4       In the case of <a href=\"/doc/7293093/\" id=\"a_57\">Parbatbhai Aahir</a> (supra), again this Court has\n\nhad an occasion to consider whether the High Court can quash the\n\nFIR/complaint/criminal proceedings, in exercise of the inherent\n\njurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_58\">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C.      Considering a catena of\n\ndecisions of this Court on the point, this Court summarised the\n\nfollowing propositions:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">          “(1) <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_59\">Section 482</a> CrPC preserves the inherent powers of the\n        High Court to prevent an abuse of the process of any court or\n        to secure the ends of justice. The provision does not confer\n        new powers. It only recognises and preserves powers which\n        inhere in the High Court.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">          (2) The invocation of the jurisdiction of the High Court to\n        quash a first information report or a criminal proceeding on\n        the ground that a settlement has been arrived at between the\n        offender and the victim is not the same as the invocation of\n        jurisdiction for the purpose of compounding an offence.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_30\">        While compounding an offence, the power of the court is\n        governed by the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/91933/\" id=\"a_60\">Section 320</a> CrPC. The power to\n        quash under Section 482 is attracted even if the offence is\n        non-compoundable.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_31\">          (3) In forming an opinion whether a criminal proceeding or\n        complaint should be quashed in exercise of its jurisdiction\n        under Section 482, the High Court must evaluate whether the\n        ends of justice would justify the exercise of the inherent\n        power.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_32\">          (4) While the inherent power of the High Court has a wide\n        ambit and plenitude it has to be exercised (i) to secure the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">\f                           15</span>\n\nends of justice, or (ii) to prevent an abuse of the process of any\ncourt.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_33\">  (5) the decision as to whether a complaint or first\ninformation report should be quashed on the ground that the\noffender and victim have settled the dispute, revolves\nultimately on the facts and circumstances of each case and no\nexhaustive elaboration of principles can be formulate.\n  (6) In the exercise of the power under Section 482 and\nwhile dealing with a plea that the dispute has been settled,\nthe High Court must have due regard to the nature and\ngravity of the offence. Heinous and serious offences involving\nmental depravity or offences such as murder, rape and\ndacoity cannot appropriately be quashed though the victim or\nthe family of the victim have settled the dispute. Such\noffences are, truly speaking, not private in nature but have a\nserious impact upon society. The decision to continue with\nthe trial in such cases is founded on the overriding element of\npublic interest in punishing persons for serious offences.\n  (7) As distinguished from serious offences, there may be\ncriminal cases which have an overwhelming or predominant\nelement of a civil dispute. They stand on a distinct footing\ninsofar as the exercise of the inherent power to quash is\nconcerned.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_34\">  (8) Criminal cases involving offences which arise from\ncommercial, financial, mercantile, partnership or similar\ntransactions with an essentially civil flavour may in\nappropriate situations fall for quashing where parties have\nsettled the dispute.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_35\">  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"16596453\" id=\"span_41\">(9) In such a case, the High Court may quash the criminal\nproceeding if in view of the compromise between the\ndisputants, the possibility of a conviction is remote and the\ncontinuation of a criminal proceeding would cause oppression\nand prejudice; and\n  (10) There is yet an exception to the principle set out in\nPropositions (8) and (9) above. Economic offences involving\nthe financial and economic well-being of the State have\nimplications which lie beyond the domain of a mere dispute\nbetween private disputants.          The High Court would be\njustified in declining to quash where the offender is involved\nin an activity akin to a financial or economic fraud or\nmisdemeanour. The consequences of the act complained of\nupon the financial or economic system will weigh in the\nbalance.”\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">\f                                   16</span>\n\n\n\n\n9.5       In the case of <a href=\"/doc/16596453/\" id=\"a_61\">Manish</a> (supra), this Court has specifically\n\nobserved and held that, when it comes to the question of compounding\n\nan offence under <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_62\">Sections 307</a>, <a href=\"/doc/594493/\" id=\"a_63\">294</a> and <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_64\">34</a> IPC, by no stretch of\n\nimagination, can it be held to be an offence as between the private\n\nparties simpliciter.   It is observed that such offences will have a\n\nserious impact on the society at large.     It is further observed that\n\nwhere the accused are facing trial under Sections 307 read with\n\n<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_65\">Section 34</a> IPC, as the offences are definitely against the society,\n\naccused will have to necessarily face trial and come out unscathed by\n\ndemonstrating their innocence.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"115365177\" id=\"span_43\">9.6       In the case of <a href=\"/doc/115365177/\" id=\"a_66\">Deepak</a> (supra), this Court has specifically\n\nobserved that as offence under <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_67\">Section 307</a> IPC is non-compoundable\n\nand as the offence under Section 307 is not a private dispute between\n\nthe parties inter se, but is a crime against the society, quashing of the\n\nproceedings on the basis of a compromise is not permissible.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"94860131\" id=\"span_44\">Similar\n\nis the view taken by this Court in a recent decision of this Court in the\n\ncase of Kalyan Singh (supra) and <a href=\"/doc/94860131/\" id=\"a_68\">Dhruv Gurjar</a> (supra).</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"160278245\" id=\"span_45\">10.       Now so far as the decision of this Court in the case of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/160278245/\" id=\"a_69\">Narinder Singh</a> (supra) is concerned, this Court in paragraph 29.6\n\nadmitted that the offences under <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_70\">Section 307</a> IPC would fall in the\n\ncategory of heinous and serious offences and therefore are to be\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">\f                                   17</span>\n\ngenerally treated as crime against the society and not against the\n\nindividual alone.

Now so far as the reliance placed upon the decision of this\n\nCourt in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1282121/\" id=\"a_73\">Shiji</a> (supra), while quashing the FIR by observing\n\nthat as the complainant has compromised with the accused, there is\n\nno possibility of recording a conviction, and/or the further trial would\n\nbe an exercise in futility is concerned, we are of the opinion that the\n\nHigh Court has clearly erred in quashing the FIR on the aforesaid\n\nground. It appears that the High Court has misread or misapplied <a href=\"/doc/1282121/\" id=\"a_74\">the\n\nsaid decision</a> to the facts of the cases on hand. The High Court ought\n\nto have appreciated that it is not in every case where the complainant\n\nhas entered into a compromise with the accused, there may not be any\n\nconviction. Such observations are presumptive and many a time too\n\nearly to opine. In a given case, it may happen that the prosecution still\n\ncan prove the guilt by leading cogent evidence and examining the\n\nother witnesses and the relevant evidence/material, more particularly\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">\f                                   18</span>\n\nwhen the dispute is not a commercial transaction and/or of a civil\n\nnature and/or is not a private wrong.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1282121\" id=\"span_50\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/1282121/\" id=\"a_75\">Shiji</a> (supra), this\n\nCourt found that the case had its origin in the civil dispute between\n\nthe parties, which dispute was resolved by them and therefore this\n\nCourt observed that, ‘that being so, continuance of the prosecution\n\nwhere the complainant is not ready to support the allegations…will be\n\na futile exercise that will serve no purpose’. In the aforesaid case, it\n\nwas also further observed ‘that even the alleged two eyewitnesses,\n\nhowever, closely related to the complainant, were not supporting the\n\nprosecution version’, and to that this Court observed and held ‘that\n\nthe continuance of the proceedings is nothing but an empty formality\n\nand <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_76\">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. can, in such circumstances, be justifiably\n\ninvoked by the High Court to prevent abuse of the process of law and\n\nthereby preventing a wasteful exercise by the courts below. Even in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1282121/\" id=\"a_77\">the said decision</a>, in paragraph 18, it is observed as under:</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1282121\" id=\"span_51\">“18. Having said so, we must hasten to add that the\n        plenitude of the power under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_78\">Section 482</a> CrPC by itself,\n        makes it obligatory for the High Court to exercise the\n        same with utmost care and caution. The width and the\n        nature of the power itself demands that its exercise is\n        sparing and only in cases where the High Court is, for\n        reasons to be recorded, of the clear view that continuance\n        of the prosecution would be nothing but an abuse of the\n        process of law. It is neither necessary nor proper for us to\n        enumerate the situations in which the exercise of power\n        under Section 482 may be justified. All that we need to\n        say is that the exercise of power must be for securing the\n        ends of justice and only in cases where refusal to exercise\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">\f                                   19</span>\n\n        that power may result in the abuse of the process of law.\n        The High Court may be justified in declining interference\n        if it is called upon to appreciate evidence for it cannot\n        assume the role of an appellate court while dealing with a\n        petition under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_79\">Section 482</a> of the Criminal Procedure\n        Code. Subject to the above, the High Court will have to\n        consider the facts and circumstances of each case to\n        determine whether it is a fit case in which the inherent\n        powers may be invoked.”\n\n\n11.1      Therefore<a href=\"/doc/1282121/\" id=\"a_80\">, <a href=\"/doc/1282121/\" id=\"a_81\">the said decision</a></a> may be applicable in a case\n\nwhich has its origin in the civil dispute between the parties; the\n\nparties have resolved the dispute; that the offence is not against the\n\nsociety at large and/or the same may not have social impact; the\n\ndispute is a family/matrimonial dispute etc. The aforesaid decision\n\nmay not be applicable in a case where the offences alleged are very\n\nserious and grave offences, having a social impact like offences under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_82\">Section 307</a> IPC. Therefore, without proper application of mind to the\n\nrelevant facts and circumstances, in our view, the High Court has\n\nmaterially erred in mechanically quashing the FIR, by observing that\n\nin view of the compromise, there are no chances of recording\n\nconviction and/or the further trial would be an exercise in futility.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1282121\" id=\"span_53\">The High Court has mechanically considered the aforesaid decision of\n\nthis Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1282121/\" id=\"a_83\">Shiji</a> (supra), without considering the relevant\n\nfacts and circumstances of the case.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"193433171\" id=\"span_54\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"193433171\" id=\"span_55\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"160278245\" id=\"span_56\">12.

In <a href=\"/doc/193433171/\" id=\"a_89\">the said decision</a>, this Court\n\nfurther observed that in compounding the offences, the power of a\n\ncriminal court is circumscribed by the provisions contained in <a href=\"/doc/91933/\" id=\"a_90\">Section\n\n320</a> Cr.P.C. and the court is guided solely and squarely thereby, while,\n\non the other hand, the formation of opinion by the High Court for\n\nquashing a criminal proceedings or criminal complaint under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_91\">Section\n\n482</a> Cr.P.C. is guided by the material on record as to whether ends of\n\njustice would justify such exercise of power, although ultimate\n\nconsequence may be acquittal or dismissal of indictment.</span></span></span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"160278245\" id=\"span_58\">However, in\n\nthe subsequent decision in the case of <a href=\"/doc/160278245/\" id=\"a_92\">Narinder Singh</a> (supra), the very\n\nBench ultimately concluded in paragraph 29 as under:</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">        “29. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we sum up and\n        lay down the following principles by which the High Court\n        would be guided in giving adequate treatment to the\n        settlement between the parties and exercising its power\n        under Section 482 of the Code while accepting the\n        settlement and quashing the proceedings or refusing to\n        accept the settlement with direction to continue with the\n        criminal proceedings:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">        29.1. Power conferred under Section 482 of the Code is to\n        be distinguished from the power which lies in the Court to\n        compound the offences under Section 320 of the Code. No\n        doubt, under Section 482 of the      Code, the High Court\n        has inherent power to quash the criminal proceedings\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">\f                          21</span>\n\neven in those cases which are not compoundable, where\nthe parties have settled the matter between themselves.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_41\">However, this power is to be exercised sparingly and with\ncaution.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_42\">29.2. When the parties have reached the settlement and\non that basis petition for quashing the criminal\nproceedings is filed, the guiding factor in such cases\nwould be to secure:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">     (i) ends of justice, or\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">     (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any court.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_43\">While exercising the power the High Court is to form an\nopinion on either of the aforesaid two objectives.\n29.3. Such a power is not to be exercised in those\nprosecutions which involve heinous and serious offences\nof mental depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity,\netc. Such offences are not private in nature and have a\nserious impact on society. Similarly, for the offences\nalleged to have been committed under special statute like\nthe <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_93\">Prevention of Corruption Act</a> or the offences\ncommitted by public servants while working in that\ncapacity are not to be quashed merely on the basis of\ncompromise between the victim and the offender.\n29.4. On the other hand, those criminal cases having\noverwhelmingly and predominantly civil character,\nparticularly those arising out of commercial transactions\nor arising out of matrimonial relationship or family\ndisputes should be quashed when the parties have\nresolved their entire disputes among themselves.\n29.5. While exercising its powers, the High Court is to\nexamine as to whether the possibility of conviction is\nremote and bleak and continuation of criminal cases\nwould put the accused to great oppression and prejudice\nand extreme injustice would be caused to him by not\nquashing the criminal cases.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_44\">29.6. Offences under <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_94\">Section 307</a> IPC would fall in the\ncategory of heinous and serious offences and therefore are\nto be generally treated as crime against the society and\nnot against the individual alone. However, the High Court\nwould not rest its decision merely because there is a\nmention of <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_95\">Section 307</a> IPC in the FIR or the charge is\nframed under this provision. It would be open to the High\nCourt to examine as to whether incorporation of <a href=\"/doc/1439341/\" id=\"a_96\">Section\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">\f                           22</span></a>\n\n<a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_97\">307</a> IPC is there for the sake of it or the prosecution has\ncollected sufficient evidence, which if proved, would lead\nto proving the charge under <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_98\">Section 307</a> IPC. For this\npurpose, it would be open to the High Court to go by the\nnature of injury sustained, whether such injury is\ninflicted on the vital/delegate parts of the body, nature of\nweapons used, etc. Medical report in respect of injuries\nsuffered by the victim can generally be the guiding factor.\nOn the basis of this prima facie analysis, the High Court\ncan examine as to whether there is a strong possibility of\nconviction or the chances of conviction are remote and\nbleak. In the former case it can refuse to accept the\nsettlement and quash the criminal proceedings whereas\nin the latter case it would be permissible for the High\nCourt to accept the plea compounding the offence based\non complete settlement between the parties. At this stage,\nthe Court can also be swayed by the fact that the\nsettlement between the parties is going to result in\nharmony between them which may improve their future\nrelationship.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_45\">29.7. While deciding whether to exercise its power under\nSection 482 of the Code or not, timings of settlement play\na crucial role. Those cases where the settlement is\narrived at immediately after the alleged commission of\noffence and the matter is still under investigation, the\nHigh Court may be liberal in accepting the settlement to\nquash the criminal proceedings/investigation. It is\nbecause of the reason that at this stage the investigation\nis still on and even the charge-sheet has not been filed.\nLikewise, those cases where the charge is framed but the\nevidence is yet to start or the evidence is still at infancy\nstage, the High Court can show benevolence in exercising\nits powers favourably, but after prima facie assessment of\nthe circumstances/material mentioned above. On the\nother hand, where the prosecution evidence is almost\ncomplete or after the conclusion of the evidence the\nmatter is at the stage of argument, normally the High\nCourt should refrain from exercising its power under\nSection 482 of the Code, as in such cases the trial court\nwould be in a position to decide the case finally on merits\nand to come to a conclusion as to whether the offence\nunder <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_99\">Section 307</a> IPC is committed or not. Similarly, in\nthose cases where the conviction is already recorded by\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">\f                                       23</span>\n\n             the trial court and the matter is at the appellate stage\n             before the High Court, mere compromise between the\n             parties would not be a ground to accept the same\n             resulting in acquittal of the offender who has already\n             been convicted by the trial court. Here charge is proved\n             under <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_100\">Section 307</a> IPC and conviction is already recorded\n             of a heinous crime and, therefore, there is no question of\n             sparing a convict found guilty of such a crime.”\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_46\">13.            Considering the law on the point and the other decisions of\n\nthis Court on the point, referred to hereinabove, it is observed and\n\nheld as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">      i)       that the power conferred under Section 482 of the Code to\n\n      quash the criminal proceedings for the non-compoundable\n\n      offences under Section 320 of the Code can be exercised having\n\n      overwhelmingly and predominantly the civil character, particularly\n\n      those arising out of commercial transactions or arising out of\n\n      matrimonial relationship or family disputes and when the parties\n\n      have resolved the entire dispute amongst themselves;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">      ii)      such power is not to be exercised in those prosecutions\n\n      which involved heinous and serious offences of mental depravity\n\n      or offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc. Such offences are not\n\n      private in nature and have a serious impact on society;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">      iii)     similarly, such power is not to be exercised for the offences\n\n      under the special statutes like <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_101\">Prevention of Corruption Act</a> or the\n\n      offences committed by public servants while working in that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">\f                                24</span>\n\ncapacity are not to be quashed merely on the basis of compromise\n\nbetween the victim and the offender;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">iv)        offences under Section 307 IPC and the Arms Act etc.\n\nwould fall in the category of heinous and serious offences and\n\ntherefore are to be treated as crime against the society and not\n\nagainst   the   individual   alone,   and   therefore,   the   criminal\n\nproceedings for the offence under <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_102\">Section 307</a> IPC and/or the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1934415/\" id=\"a_103\">Arms Act</a> etc. which have a serious impact on the society cannot\n\nbe quashed in exercise of powers under Section 482 of the Code,\n\non the ground that the parties have resolved their entire dispute\n\namongst themselves. However, the High Court would not rest its\n\ndecision merely because there is a mention of <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_104\">Section 307</a> IPC in\n\nthe FIR or the charge is framed under this provision. It would be\n\nopen to the High Court to examine as to whether incorporation of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_105\">Section 307</a> IPC is there for the sake of it or the prosecution has\n\ncollected sufficient evidence, which if proved, would lead to\n\nframing the charge under <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_106\">Section 307</a> IPC. For this purpose, it\n\nwould be open to the High Court to go by the nature of injury\n\nsustained, whether such injury is inflicted on the vital/delegate\n\nparts of the body, nature of weapons used etc. However, such an\n\nexercise by the High Court would be permissible only after the\n\nevidence is collected after investigation and the charge sheet is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">\f                                25</span>\n\nfiled/charge is framed and/or during the trial. Such exercise is\n\nnot permissible when the matter is still under investigation.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"160278245\" id=\"span_64\">Therefore, the ultimate conclusion in paragraphs 29.6 and 29.7 of\n\nthe decision of this Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/160278245/\" id=\"a_107\">Narinder Singh</a> (supra)\n\nshould be read harmoniously and to be read as a whole and in the\n\ncircumstances stated hereinabove;</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_48\">v)          while exercising the power under Section 482 of the\n\nCode   to   quash     the   criminal   proceedings      in    respect    of\n\nnon-compoundable offences, which are private in nature and do\n\nnot have a serious impart on society, on the ground that there is a\n\nsettlement/compromise between the victim and the offender, the\n\nHigh Court is required to consider the antecedents of the accused;\n\nthe conduct of the accused, namely, whether the accused was\n\nabsconding and why he was absconding, how he had managed\n\nwith the complainant to enter into a compromise etc.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_49\">14.         Insofar as the present case is concerned, the High\n\nCourt has quashed the criminal proceedings for the offences\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_108\">Sections 307</a> and <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_109\">34</a> IPC mechanically and even when the\n\ninvestigation   was   under    progress.     Somehow,        the   accused\n\nmanaged to enter into a compromise with the complainant and\n\nsought quashing of the FIR on the          basis of a settlement.       The\n\nallegations are serious in nature.     He used the fire arm also in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_65\">\f                                     26</span>\n\n      commission of the offence.    Therefore, the gravity of the offence\n\n      and the conduct of the accused is not at all considered by the\n\n      High Court and solely on the basis of a settlement between the\n\n      accused and the complainant, the High Court has mechanically\n\n      quashed the FIR, in exercise of power under Section 482 of the\n\n      Code, which is not sustainable in the eyes of law.

In view of the above and for the reasons stated, the present\n\nappeal is allowed.        The impugned judgment and order dated\n\n07.10.2013 passed by the High Court in Miscellaneous Criminal Case\n\nNo. 8000 of 2013 is hereby quashed and set aside, and the\n\nFIR/investigation/criminal proceedings be proceeded against the\n\naccused, and they shall be dealt with, in accordance with law.\n\n\n\nCriminal Appeal No.350 of 2019\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_51\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1282121\" id=\"span_66\">16.         So far as Criminal Appeal arising out of SLP 10324/2018 is\n\nconcerned, by the impugned judgment and order, the High Court has\n\nquashed the criminal proceedings for the offences punishable under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_110\">Sections 323</a>, <a href=\"/doc/594493/\" id=\"a_111\">294</a>, <a href=\"/doc/4266/\" id=\"a_112\">308</a> &amp; <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_113\">34</a> of the IPC, solely on the ground that the\n\naccused and the complainant have settled the matter and in view of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\">\f                                   27</span>\n\nthe decision of this Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1282121/\" id=\"a_114\">Shiji</a>(supra), there may not be\n\nany possibility of recording a conviction against the accused.
