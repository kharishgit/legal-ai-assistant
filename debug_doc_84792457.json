The High Court posted the hearing of the petition for considering the\n\nprayer for quashing of the FIR on 10 December 2020. It declined to accede to the\n\nprayer for the grant of bail, placing reliance on a decision of this Court in State of\n\nTelangana vs Habib Abdullah Jeelani4 (―Habib Jeelani‖). The High Court was\n\nof the view that the prayers for interim relief proceeded on the premise that the\n\nappellant had been illegally detained and since he was in judicial custody, it\n\nwould not entertain the request for bail or for stay of the investigation in the\n\nexercise of its extra-ordinary jurisdiction. The High Court held that since the\n\nappellant was in judicial custody, it was open to him to avail of the remedy of bail\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1290514/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 439</a> of the CrPC.

However, even on 9\n\nNovember 2020, the Public Prosecutor has filed a note before the Sessions\n\nJudge that the revision application filed by the State against the order of the CJM\n\nshould be heard first and it is only thereafter that the application for bail should be\n\ntaken up. On the basis of the above submissions, it has been urged that the\n\nappellant has been made a target of the vendetta of the State government, which\n\nemerges from the successive events adverted to above which have taken place\n\nsince April 2020. Hence, it has been urged that there is absolutely no ground to\n\ncontinue the arrest of the appellant and absent any reasonable basis for\n\ndepriving him of his liberty, an order for the grant of bail should have been\n\npassed by the High Court. Mr. Salve finally submitted that the interest in\n\npreserving the procedural hierarchy of courts must give way to the need to\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                          17</span>\n\f                                                                                PART E\n\nprotect the appellant‘s personal liberty given the well settled legal position that\n\nthe default rule is ‗bail, not jail‘.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">25        Opposing the above submissions, Mr Amit Desai, learned Senior Counsel\n\nappearing on behalf of the second respondent submits that:\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">(i)       The High Court has advisably not enquired into whether:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">           i.

Hence, he submitted that the\n\nInvestigating Officer was within jurisdiction in carrying out further investigation.\n\nFinally, Mr Sibal argued that while he is alive to the fact that the personal liberty\n\nof the appellant is at stake in the present case, this Court does refuse to interfere\n\nin many cases exhibiting similar features.

The first relief is for a writ of habeas corpus. This relief has been claimed\n\non the basis that the arrest and consequent detention of the appellant was due to\n\na reinvestigation which was commenced after placing reliance on the letter dated\n\n26 May 2020 of the Home Department of the Government of Maharashtra to the\n\nDirector General of Police. The submission is that once the CJM accepted the\n\nreport submitted by the Investigating Officer and issued an ‗A‘ summary on 16\n\nApril 2019, it was not open to the Investigating Officer to commence a\n\nreinvestigation without judicial sanction.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_48\">\n36    Joining issue with this submission is the argument of the State that the\n\npower of the investigating officer to order a further investigation under <a href=\"/doc/274924/\" id=\"a_79\">Section\n\n173(8)</a> of the CrPC is independent of the jurisdiction of the Magistrate. In the view\n\nof the State, <a href=\"/doc/190048220/\" id=\"a_80\">Section 4</a> of the Bombay Police Act, 1951 entrusts the\n\nsuperintendence of the police force to it and in the exercise of that power, it was\n\nlegitimately open to the Home Department to direct a further investigation (though\n\nthe letter uses the expression ‗re-investigation‘) to be conducted based on the\n\ncomplaint of the victim that the offence had not been properly investigated.\n\nMoreover, the State has relied on the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1013783/\" id=\"a_81\">Section 36</a> of the CrPC under\n\nwhich police officers superior in rank to an officer in charge of a police station are\n\nentitled to exercise the same powers throughout the local area to which they are\n\nappointed.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">                                             25</span><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_49\">\n\f                                                                              PART G\n\n37    According to the appellant, when proceedings before the High Court came\n\nto be instituted, an order of remand had not been passed and it was only\n\nsubsequently on the night of 4 November 2020 that an order granting judicial\n\ncustody was passed by the CJM. Be that as it may, the High Court has recorded\n\nthat prayer (a) for the issuance of a writ of Habeas Corpus was not pressed on\n\nbehalf of the appellant. Once the prayer for a writ of habeas corpus was not\n\npressed (as the High Court records), it was unnecessary for the High Court to\n\ndevote several pages in the impugned judgment on discussing the issue.\n\n\n38    The remaining prayer before the High Court was for quashing the FIR. Mr\n\nRohatgi submitted that the order of arrest is illegal and the appellant is entitled to\n\nhave it so declared by invoking the jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_82\">Article 226</a> of the\n\nConstitution and <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_83\">Section 482</a> of the CrPC. It was urged that the power under\n\nSection 173(8) is to cause a ―further investigation‖ and no power has been vested\n\nto either reinvestigate or cause a fresh investigation to be made. The power to\n\nreinvestigate or to cause fresh investigation, it was urged, is vested only in the\n\nconstitutional courts. Contrary to the provisions of Section 173(8), it was urged,\n\nthe Home Department in its letter to the deputy Inspector General has directed a\n\nreinvestigation. In the present case, the communication of the Home Department\n\nmakes it abundantly clear that a reinvestigation was ordered under the authority\n\nof the State Home Minister which, according to the submission, is ultra vires the\n\nprovisions of law. Mr Rohatgi has emphasised that the application for remand\n\nmakes it clear that what is ordered was a reinvestigation, since the application\n\nhas repeatedly used the expression ―comprehensive reinvestigation‖ and the fact\n\nthat ―reinvestigation has become necessary‖.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_50\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">                                         26</span>\n\f                                                                               PART H\n\n39    Finally, it was urged that the order of the Home Minister in the State was\n\nissued on 26 May 2020 whereas the investigation commenced on 15 October\n\n2020 and the arrest was made on 4 November 2020 in respect of an FIR lodged\n\nin May 2018 on which an ‗A‘ summary had been accepted on 16 April 2019.

The High Court observed that the powers to quash ―are to be\n\nexercised sparingly and that too, in rare and appropriate cases and in extreme\n\ncircumstances to prevent abuse of process of law‖. Applying this principle, the\n\nHigh Court opined:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">             ―45.

This was a case where, on the basis of a report\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/127727035/\" id=\"a_95\">Section 154</a> off the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_96\">CrPC</a>, an FIR was registered for offences punishable\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1258372/\" id=\"a_97\">Sections 147</a>, <a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_98\">148</a>, <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_99\">149</a> and <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_100\">307</a> of the IPC. Challenging the initiation of the\n\ncriminal action, the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court to quash an FIR was\n\ninvoked. The High Court (as paragraph 2 of the judgment of this Court in Habib\n\nJeelani (supra) indicates) expressed its ―disinclination to interfere on the ground\n\nthat it was not appropriate to stay the investigation of the case‖. It was in this\n\nbackground that the following issue was formulated in the first paragraph of the\n\njudgment of this Court, speaking through Justice Dipak Misra (as he then was),\n\nfor consideration:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_54\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">                                              28</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">\f                                                                               PART H\n\n            ―1. The seminal issue that arises for consideration in this\n            appeal, by special leave, is whether the High Court while\n            refusing to exercise inherent powers under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_101\">Section 482</a> of the\n            Code of Criminal Procedure (<a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_102\">CrPC</a>) to interfere in an\n            application for quashment of the investigation, can restrain the\n            investigating agency not to arrest the accused persons during\n            the course of investigation.‖\n\n\n\nBetween paragraphs 11 and 15, this Court then evaluated the nature of the\n\njurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_103\">Section 482</a> of the CrPC or under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_104\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution\n\nfor quashing an FIR and observed:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">            ―11.

The courts should oust\n                  and obstruct unscrupulous litigants from invoking the inherent\n                  jurisdiction of the Court on the drop of a hat to file an\n                  application for quashing of launching an FIR or investigation\n                  and then seek relief by an interim order. It is the obligation of\n                  the Court to keep such unprincipled and unethical litigants at\n                  bay.‖\n\n\n\n44        The above decision thus arose in a situation where the High Court had\n\ndeclined to entertain a petition for quashing an FIR under Section 482 of the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">14</span>\n     (2014) 4 SCC 453\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">                                                    32</span>\n\f                                                                            PART I\n\n<a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_128\">CrPC</a>.

Clearly therefore, the\n\nHigh Court in the present case has misdirected itself in declining to enquire prima\n\nfacie on a petition for quashing whether the parameters in the exercise of that\n\njurisdiction have been duly established and if so whether a case for the grant of\n\ninterim bail has been made out.

The\n                  act of the accused, however, insulting the deceased by using\n                  abusive language will not, by itself, constitute the abetment of\n                  suicide. There should be evidence capable of suggesting that\n                  the accused intended by such act to instigate the deceased to\n                  commit suicide. Unless the ingredients of instigation/abetment\n                  to commit suicide are satisfied the accused cannot be\n                  convicted under <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_167\">Section 306</a> IPC.‖\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_74\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"43154838\" id=\"span_79\">51         Similarly, in another recent judgment of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/43154838/\" id=\"a_168\">Ude Singh and Ors.\n\nvs State of Haryana26</a>, a two judge Bench of this Court, speaking through Justice\n\nDinesh Maheshwari, expounded on the ingredients of <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_169\">Section 306</a> of the IPC,\n\nand the factors to be considered in determining whether a case falls within the\n\nken of the aforesaid provision, in the following terms:</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">                    ―38. In cases of alleged abetment of suicide, there must be a\n                    proof of direct or indirect act/s of incitement to the\n                    commission of suicide. It could hardly be disputed that the\n                    question of cause of a suicide, particularly in the context of an\n                    offence of abetment of suicide, remains a vexed one,\n                    involving multifaceted and complex attributes of human\n                    behaviour and responses/reactions. In the case of accusation\n                    for abetment of suicide, the Court would be looking for cogent\n                    and convincing proof of the act/s of incitement to the\n                    commission of suicide. In the case of suicide, mere allegation\n                    of harassment of the deceased by another person would not\n                    suffice unless there be such action on the part of the accused\n                    which compels the person to commit suicide; and such an\n                    offending action ought to be proximate to the time of\n                    occurrence. Whether a person has abetted in the commission\n                    of suicide by another or not, could only be gathered from the\n                    facts and circumstances of each case.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">                    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"61904359\" id=\"span_80\">39. For the purpose of finding out if a person has abetted\n                    commission of suicide by another, the consideration would be\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_81\">26</span>\n     Criminal Appeal No. 233 of 2010 decided on 25 July 2019\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_82\">                                                       39</span>\n\f                                                                                      PART I\n\n                   if the accused is guilty of the act of instigation of the act of\n                   suicide. As explained and reiterated by this Court in the\n                   decisions above-referred, instigation means to goad, urge\n                   forward, provoke, incite or encourage to do an act. If the\n                   persons who committed suicide had been hypersensitive and\n                   the action of accused is otherwise not ordinarily expected to\n                   induce a similarly circumstanced person to commit suicide, it\n                   may not be safe to hold the accused guilty of abetment of\n                   suicide. But, on the other hand, if the accused by his acts and\n                   by his continuous course of conduct creates a situation which\n                   leads the deceased perceiving no other option except to\n                   commit suicide, the case may fall within the four-corners of\n                   <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_170\">Section 306</a> IPC. If the accused plays an active role in\n                   tarnishing the self-esteem and self-respect of the victim,\n                   which eventually draws the victim to commit suicide, the\n                   accused may be held guilty of abetment of suicide. The\n                   question of mens rea on the part of the accused in such\n                   cases would be examined with reference to the actual acts\n                   and deeds of the accused and if the acts and deeds are only\n                   of such nature where the accused intended nothing more\n                   than harassment or snap show of anger, a particular case\n                   may fall short of the offence of abetment of suicide. However,\n                   if the accused kept on irritating or annoying the deceased by\n                   words or deeds until the deceased reacted or was provoked,\n                   a particular case may be that of abetment of suicide. Such\n                   being the matter of delicate analysis of human behaviour,\n                   each case is required to be examined on its own facts, while\n                   taking note of all the surrounding factors having bearing on\n                   the actions and psyche of the accused and the deceased.‖\n\n\n\nSimilarly, in <a href=\"/doc/61904359/\" id=\"a_171\">Rajesh vs State of Haryana27</a>, a two judge Bench of this Court,\n\nspeaking through Justice L.

Such harassment, coupled with the\n                  utterance of words to the effect, that, ―had there been any\n                  other person in his place, he would have certainly committed\n                  suicide‖ is what makes the present case distinct from the\n                  aforementioned cases.

In the light of these facts, coupled with\n              the fact that the suicide note made definite allegation against\n              first respondent, the High Court was not justified in entering\n              into question whether the first respondent had the requisite\n              intention to aid or instigate or abet the commission of suicide.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_78\">              <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"135257296\" id=\"span_94\">At this juncture when the investigation was yet to be\n              completed and charge-sheet, if any, was yet to be filed, the\n              High Court ought not to have gone into the aspect whether\n              there was requisite mental element or intention on part of the\n              respondent.‖\n\n\n\nThe above observations of the Court clearly indicated that there was a specific\n\nallegation in the FIR bearing on the imputation that the respondent had actively\n\nfacilitated the commission of suicide by continuously harassing the spouse of the\n\nvictim and in failing to rectify his conduct despite the efforts of the victim.\n\n\n55     Now in this backdrop, it becomes necessary to advert briefly to the\n\ncontents of the FIR in the present case. The FIR recites that the spouse of the\n\ninformant had a company carrying on the business of architecture, interior design\n\nand engineering consultancy. According to the informant, her husband was over\n\nthe previous two years ―having pressure as he did not receive the money of work\n\ncarried out by him‖. The FIR recites that the deceased had called at the office of\n\nthe appellant and spoken to his accountant for the payment of money. Apart from\n\nthe above statements, it has been stated that the deceased left behind a suicide\n\nnote stating that his ―money is stuck and following owners of respective\n\ncompanies are not paying our legitimate dues‖. Prima facie, on the application of\n\nthe test which has been <a href=\"/doc/135257296/\" id=\"a_184\">laid down by</a> this Court in a consistent line of authority\n\nwhich has been noted above, it cannot be said that the appellant was guilty of\n\nhaving abetted the suicide within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_185\">Section 306</a> of the IPC.

Clearly however, the High Court in failing\n\nto notice the contents of the FIR and to make a prima facie evaluation abdicated\n\nits role, functions and jurisdiction when seized of a petition under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_186\">Section 482</a> of\n\nthe CrPC. The High Court recited the legal position that the jurisdiction to quash\n\nunder Section 482 has to be exercised sparingly. These words, however, are not\n\nmeaningless incantations, but have to be assessed with reference to the contents\n\nof the particular FIR before the High Court. If the High Court were to carry out a\n\nprima facie evaluation, it would have been impossible for it not to notice the\n\ndisconnect between the FIR and the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_187\">Section 306</a> of the IPC. The\n\nfailure of the High Court to do so has led it to adopting a position where it left the\n\nappellant to pursue his remedies for regular bail under Section 439. The High\n\nCourt was clearly in error in failing to perform a duty which is entrusted to it while\n\nevaluating a petition under Section 482 albeit at the interim stage.\n\n\n56    The petition before the High Court was instituted under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_188\">Article 226</a> of the\n\nConstitution and <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_189\">Section 482</a> of the CrPC. While dealing with the petition under\n\nsection 482 for quashing the FIR, the High Court has not considered whether\n\nprima facie the ingredients of the offence have been made out in the FIR. If the\n\nHigh Court were to have carried out this exercise, it would (as we have held in\n\nthis judgment) have been apparent that the ingredients of the offence have not\n\nprima facie been established. As a consequence of its failure to perform its\n\nfunction under Section 482, the High Court has disabled itself from exercising its\n\njurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_190\">Article 226</a> to consider the appellant‘s application for bail. In\n\nconsidering such an application under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_191\">Article 226</a>, the High Court must be\n\ncircumspect in exercising its powers on the basis of the facts of each case.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_96\">                                         45</span>\n\f                                                                                PART I\n\nHowever, the High Court should not foreclose itself from the exercise of the\n\npower when a citizen has been arbitrarily deprived of their personal liberty in an\n\nexcess of state power.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_79\">\n57        While considering an application for the grant of bail under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_192\">Article 226</a> in a\n\nsuitable case, the High Court must consider the settled factors which emerge\n\nfrom the precedents of this Court.

In emphasising that the High Court must exercise this power\n\nwith a sense of restraint, the decisions of this Court are founded on the basic\n\nprinciple that the due enforcement of criminal law should not be obstructed by the\n\naccused taking recourse to artifices and strategies. The public interest in\n\nensuring the due investigation of crime is protected by ensuring that the inherent\n\npower of the High Court is exercised with caution. That indeed is one – and a\n\nsignificant - end of the spectrum. The other end of the spectrum is equally\n\nimportant: the recognition by Section 482 of the power inhering in the High Court\n\nto prevent the abuse of process or to secure the ends of justice is a valuable\n\nsafeguard for protecting liberty. The <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_202\">Code of Criminal Procedure</a> of 1898 was\n\nenacted by a legislature which was not subject to constitutional rights and\n\nlimitations; yet it recognized the inherent power in Section 561A. Post-\n\nIndependence, the recognition by Parliament37 of the inherent power of the High\n\nCourt must be construed as an aid to preserve the constitutional value of liberty.\n\nThe writ of liberty runs through the fabric of the Constitution. The need to ensure\n\nthe fair investigation of crime is undoubtedly important in itself, because it\n\nprotects at one level the rights of the victim and, at a more fundamental level, the\n\nsocietal interest in ensuring that crime is investigated and dealt with in\n\naccordance with law. On the other hand, the misuse of the criminal law is a\n\nmatter of which the High Court and the lower Courts in this country must be alive.\n\nIn the present case, the High Court could not but have been cognizant of the\n\nspecific ground which was raised before it by the appellant that he was being\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_110\">37</span>\n     <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_203\">Section 482</a> of the CrPC 1973\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_111\">                                        48</span>\n\f                                                                               PART J\n\nmade a target as a part of a series of occurrences which have been taking place\n\nsince April 2020. The specific case of the appellant is that he has been targeted\n\nbecause his opinions on his television channel are unpalatable to authority.\n\nWhether the appellant has established a case for quashing the FIR is something\n\non which the High Court will take a final view when the proceedings are listed\n\nbefore it but we are clearly of the view that in failing to make even a prima facie\n\nevaluation of the FIR, the High Court abdicated its constitutional duty and\n\nfunction as a protector of liberty. Courts must be alive to the need to safeguard\n\nthe public interest in ensuring that the due enforcement of criminal law is not\n\nobstructed. The fair investigation of crime is an aid to it. Equally it is the duty of\n\ncourts across the spectrum – the district judiciary, the High Courts and the\n\nSupreme Court – to ensure that the criminal law does not become a weapon for\n\nthe selective harassment of citizens. Courts should be alive to both ends of the\n\nspectrum – the need to ensure the proper enforcement of criminal law on the one\n\nhand and the need, on the other, of ensuring that the law does not become a\n\nruse for targeted harassment. Liberty across human eras is as tenuous as\n\ntenuous can be. Liberty survives by the vigilance of her citizens, on the\n\ncacophony of the media and in the dusty corridors of courts alive to the rule of\n\n(and not by) law. Yet, much too often, liberty is a casualty when one of these\n\ncomponents is found wanting.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_82\">\n61    Mr Kapil Sibal, Mr Amit Desai and Mr Chander Uday Singh are\n\nundoubtedly right in submitting that the procedural hierarchy of courts in matters\n\nconcerning the grant of bail needs to be respected. However, there was a failure\n\nof the High Court to discharge its adjudicatory function at two levels – first in\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_112\">                                         49</span>\n\f                                                                                       PART J\n\ndeclining to evaluate prima facie at the interim stage in a petition for quashing the\n\nFIR as to whether an arguable case has been made out, and secondly, in\n\ndeclining interim bail, as a consequence of its failure to render a prima facie\n\nopinion on the first. The High Court did have the power to protect the citizen by\n\nan interim order in a petition invoking <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_204\">Article 226.</a> Where the High Court has\n\nfailed to do so, this Court would be abdicating its role and functions as a\n\nconstitutional court if it refuses to interfere, despite the parameters for such\n\ninterference being met. The doors of this Court cannot be closed to a citizen who\n\nis able to establish prima facie that the instrumentality of the State is being\n\nweaponized for using the force of criminal law. Our courts must ensure that they\n\ncontinue to remain the first line of defense against the deprivation of the liberty of\n\ncitizens. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"52834611\" id=\"span_113\">Deprivation of liberty even for a single day is one day too many.

The High Courts\n\nand Courts in the district judiciary of India must enforce this principle in practice,\n\nand not forego that duty, leaving this Court to intervene at all times. We must in\n\nparticular also emphasise the role of the district judiciary, which provides the first\n\npoint of interface to the citizen. Our district judiciary is wrongly referred to as the\n\n‗subordinate judiciary‘. It may be subordinate in hierarchy but it is not subordinate\n\nin terms of its importance in the lives of citizens or in terms of the duty to render\n\njustice to them. High Courts get burdened when courts of first instance decline to\n\ngrant anticipatory bail or bail in deserving cases. This continues in the Supreme\n\nCourt as well, when High Courts do not grant bail or anticipatory bail in cases\n\nfalling within the parameters of the law. The consequence for those who suffer\n\nincarceration are serious. Common citizens without the means or resources to\n\nmove the High Courts or this Court languish as undertrials. Courts must be alive\n\nto the situation as it prevails on the ground – in the jails and police stations where\n\nhuman dignity has no protector. As judges, we would do well to remind ourselves\n\nthat it is through the instrumentality of bail that our criminal justice system‘s\n\nprimordial interest in preserving the presumption of innocence finds its most\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_116\">39</span>\n   (1977) 4 SCC 308\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_117\">40</span>\n   These words of Justice Krishna Iyer are not isolated silos in our jurisprudence, but have been consistently\nfollowed in judgments of this Court for decades. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1563495\" id=\"span_118\">Some of these judgments are: State of U.P. vs Amarmani\nTripathi, (<a href=\"/doc/1563495/\" id=\"a_208\">2005) 8 SCC 21 and Sanjay Chandra vs CBI</a>, (2012) 1 SCC 40.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_119\">                                                     51</span>\n\f                                                                                                           PART J\n\neloquent expression.
