In \nthe said petition, a prayer was made by the appellants to \nquash the charge sheet and the consequential proceedings \narising out of First Information Report (F.I.R) No. 155 of 1995, \ninstituted in the court of Metropolitan Magistrate, New Delhi.   \nAppellants No. 1, 2 and 3 are respectively the father-in-law, \nsister-in-law and the husband of the complainant.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">3.\tA few facts, leading to the present proceedings and \nnecessary to dispose of the appeal are:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">\tThe marriage between the complainant and appellant No. \n3 was solemnized at New Delhi on 5.12.1993. After the \nmarriage, the complainant was residing at her matrimonial \nhome in Delhi.  It appears that there was some matrimonial \ndiscord between the complainant and her husband, appellant \nNo. 3, which resulted in filing of a complaint by the \ncomplainant on 17.5.1994 in the Crime against Women \n(\u0013CAW\u0014 for short) Cell, Delhi, inter alia, alleging that she was \nharassed by her husband and in-laws.  However, the matter \nwas compromised on 26.6.1994 and as agreed, on 3.7.1994, \nthe complainant joined her husband at Bijnore (U.P.), where \nhe was posted.  However, she returned back to her parental \nhome in Delhi in mid-August 1994, as she was expecting a \nchild.  \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">4.\tOn 8.11.1994, she lodged another complaint in CAW \nCell.  The said complaint was the foundation for registration of \nF.I.R. No. 155 of 1995, alleging commission of offences by the \nappellants under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_1\">Sections 498A</a>, <a href=\"/doc/988620/\" id=\"a_2\">406</a>/<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_3\">34</a> of the Indian Penal \nCode (\u0013<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_4\">I.P.C</a>.\u0014, for short).   For the sake of ready reference, the \nsame is extracted below:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">\u0013I, Neetu, d/o R.P. Dixit W/o Ashutosh Misra \nwish to inform you that as per compromise in \nthe Cell on 22.6.1994 with my husband I went \nto Bijnore on 3.7.1994 on the suggestion of my \nhusband I came to Delhi along with my \nparents on 12.8.1994 for delivery.  I gave birth \nto a son on 4.9.1994.  My husband came to \nhospital on 5.9.1994 and requested me to \ncome to Bijnore after 40 days.  He gave me no \nmoney for expenditure.  When I left Bijnore he \ngave me only Rs.1/- only.  I did not receive any \nphone from him till 7th November, 1994.  Then \nI phoned him and told him that he was \nrequired to go to Cell on 28.10.1994.  He told \nme that he has no time to go to Cell and to \nbring me to Bijnore.  You can come to Bijnore \nif you apologize to my father.  Keep him happy, \nobey my sister and talk to your father to give \nyou Rs.50,000/- and VCR to bring with you.  \nThen I can come to bring you.  If you come \nhere alone with the child, we will give you good \nbeatings.  \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">My husband came to Rajouri Garden every \nSaturday \u0016 Sunday in September \u0016 October \nand on Dushera &amp; Diwali.  This can be verified \nfrom neighbour Hira Lal and Smt. Nirmala \nSharma, President Mahilla Jagriti Samiti.  \nAlmost 2 weeks ago, Hira Lal informed me that \nmy husband took away all my belongings with \nhim at 4 A.M.\nIn view of above facts, I think these three \npersons are conspiring.  Therefore, I request \nthat my case may be re-opened and my father-\nin-law, husband and sister-in-law may be \npunished.\u0014\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">5.\tAs noted above, on the basis of the said report, an F.I.R. \n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">was registered on 4.4.1995, wherein date and hours of \noccurrence was mentioned as 5.12.1993 to 12.8.1994.  Before \nthe registration of the F.I.R., another statement of the \ncomplainant was recorded wherein she alleged misbehaviour \non the part of her father-in-law, appellant No. 1.  In the said \nstatement, she stated that, \u0013my father-in-law and sister-in-law \nclearly warned him that till the time I will not bring \nRs.50,000/- cash and V.C.R. they will not keep me\u0014.  She also \nalleged that when she asked for return of the Stridhan, they \nrefused to return the same \u0013with fraudulent intentions\u0014.  After \ninvestigation by the CAW Cell, the charge-sheet was filed on \n15.7.1995.  In the charge-sheet, it has been recorded that \ndespite issue of notice under <a href=\"/doc/1957834/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 160</a> Cr.P.C. to the \ncomplainant and her father by the ASI, neither the \ncomplainant nor her father turned up to take back her \nStridhan\t, which was alleged to be with the appellants.  It has \nbeen noted that the complainant does not want to take back \nher Stridhan. \n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_5\">6.\tAt the time of framing of charge, the Metropolitan \nMagistrate came to the conclusion that no case under <a href=\"/doc/988620/\" id=\"a_6\">Section \n406</a> had been made out against any of the accused and \nfurther case under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 498A</a> was also not made out \nagainst the father-in-law and sister-in-law, being appellants \nNo. 1 and 2.  Accordingly, he discharged all the appellants for \noffences under Section 406 I.P.C. and appellants No. 1 and 2 \nfor offences under Section 498A I.P.C. \n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">7.\tAgainst the said order, the State preferred Revision \nPetition to the Sessions Court.  Vide order dated 24.1.1998, \nthe Additional Sessions Judge came to the conclusion that a \nprima facie case under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_8\">Sections 498A</a> and <a href=\"/doc/988620/\" id=\"a_9\">406</a> I.P.C. was \nmade out against all the appellants.  Accordingly, he directed \nthe trial court to proceed with the case against all the \nappellants under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_10\">Sections 498A</a>/<a href=\"/doc/988620/\" id=\"a_11\">406</a>/<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_12\">34</a> I.P.C. and frame the \ncharges accordingly.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_7\">8.\tBeing aggrieved, the appellants filed a Criminal Revision \nPetition before the High Court.  As noted above, the said \nRevision Petition was dismissed.  It is this order of the High \nCourt, which is questioned in this appeal.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">9.\tAppellant No. 1, appearing in person, argued the case on \nbehalf of all the appellants.  It was vehemently contended that \nthe Additional Sessions Judge as well as the High Court have \nfailed to appreciate that the first complaint dated 8.11.1994 \nlodged by the complainant on the CAW Cell, which was the \nfoundation for the registration of F.I.R. No. 155 of 1995, did \nnot contain any allegation of demand of dowry or harassment \nby appellants No. 1 and 2.  It was submitted that even if the \nallegations in the statement of the complainant dated 4.4.1995 \nare taken at their face value, yet the appellants cannot be \nconnected with offences under <a href=\"/doc/988620/\" id=\"a_13\">Sections 406</a> or 498A <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_14\">I.P.C</a>., \nparticularly when admittedly after 3.7.1994, when she joined \nher husband at Bijnore, she had never lived with appellants \nNo. 1 and 2.  It is asserted that the said statement was an \nafter thought, made after almost 8 months of the alleged \noccurrence.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_9\">10.\tLearned counsel appearing on behalf of the complainant \nand the State supported the view taken by the High Court.   \n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">11.\tIt is trite that at the stage of framing of charge the court \nis required to evaluate the material and documents on record \nwith a view to finding out if the facts emerging therefrom, \ntaken at their face value, disclosed the existence of all the \ningredients constituting the alleged offence.  At that stage, the \ncourt is not expected to go deep into the probative value of the \nmaterial on record.  What needs to be considered is whether \nthere is a ground for presuming that the offence has been \ncommitted and not a ground for convicting the accused has \nbeen made out.  At that stage, even strong suspicion founded \non material which leads the court to form a presumptive \nopinion as to the existence of the factual ingredients \nconstituting the offence alleged would justify the framing of \ncharge against the accused in respect of the commission of \nthat offence. \n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">12.\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"548497\" id=\"span_1\">In <a href=\"/doc/548497/\" id=\"a_15\">State of Karnataka Vs. L. Muniswamy</a> , a three \njudge Bench of this Court had observed that at the stage of \nframing the charge, the Court has to apply its mind to the \nquestion whether or not there is any ground for presuming the \ncommission of the offence by the accused.  As framing of \ncharge affects a person\u0012s liberty substantially, need for proper \nconsideration of material warranting such order was \nemphasized.</span>  \n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_12\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"702724\" id=\"span_2\">13.\tThen again in <a href=\"/doc/702724/\" id=\"a_16\">State of Maharashtra and others Vs. \nSom Nath Thapa and others</a> , a three judge Bench of this \nCourt, after noting three pairs of sections viz. (i) <a href=\"/doc/470297/\" id=\"a_17\">Sections 227</a> \nand <a href=\"/doc/1969991/\" id=\"a_18\">228</a> insofar as sessions trial is concerned; (ii) <a href=\"/doc/1572967/\" id=\"a_19\">Sections \n239</a> and <a href=\"/doc/326674/\" id=\"a_20\">240</a> relatable to trial of warrant cases; and (iii) \n<a href=\"/doc/901796/\" id=\"a_21\">Sections 245 (1)</a> and (2) qua trial of summons cases, which \ndealt with the question of framing of charge or discharge, \nstated thus:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">\u0013if on the basis of materials on record, a court \ncould come to the conclusion that \ncommission of the offence is a probable \nconsequence, a case for framing of charge \nexists.  To put it differently, if the court were \nto think that the accused might have \ncommitted the offence it can frame the \ncharge, though for conviction the conclusion \nis required to be that the accused has \ncommitted the offence.  It is apparent that at \nthe stage of framing of a charge, probative \nvalue of the materials on record cannot be \ngone into; the materials brought on record by \nthe prosecution has to be accepted as true at \nthat stage.\u0014\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">14.\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1799968\" id=\"span_3\">In a later decision in <a href=\"/doc/1799968/\" id=\"a_22\">State of M.P. Vs. Mohanlal Soni</a> , \nthis Court, referring to several previous decisions held that the \ncrystallized judicial view is that at the stage of framing charge, \nthe court has to prima facie consider whether there is \nsufficient ground for proceeding against the accused.  The \ncourt is not required to appreciate evidence to conclude \nwhether the materials produced are sufficient or not for \nconvicting the accused.</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">15.\tHaving noted the broad guidelines to be kept in view \nwhile deciding whether or not a charge against the accused is \nto be framed, we may advert to the facts of the present case to \ndecide whether on the basis of the material placed before the \ntrial court, it can reasonably be held that a case for framing \ncharges against the appellants under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_23\">Sections 498A</a> and <a href=\"/doc/988620/\" id=\"a_24\">406</a> \nI.P.C. exists.  However, before undertaking this exercise it \nwould be apposite to briefly note the essential ingredients of \nSections 406 and 498A I.P.C. \t\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">16.\tAccording to <a href=\"/doc/1249173/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 405</a> I.P.C., the offence of criminal \nbreach of trust is committed when a person who is entrusted \nin any manner with the property or with any dominion over it, \ndishonestly misappropriates it or converts it to his own use, or \ndishonestly uses it, or disposes it of, in violation of any \ndirection of law prescribing the mode in which the trust is to \nbe discharged, or of any lawful contract, express or implied, \nmade by him touching such discharge, or wilfully suffers any \nother person so to do.  Thus in the commission of the offence \nof criminal breach of trust, two distinct parts are involved.  \n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1009121\" id=\"span_4\">The first consists of the creation of an obligation in relation to \nthe property over which dominion or control is acquired by the \naccused.  The second is a misappropriation or dealing with the \nproperty dishonestly and contrary to the terms of the \nobligation created. (See: The Superintendent &amp; \nremembrancer of <a href=\"/doc/1009121/\" id=\"a_26\">Legal Affairs, West Bengal Vs. S.K. Roy</a> )</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">17.\tThe term \u0013cruelty\u0014, which has been made punishable \nunder <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 498A</a> I.P.C. has been defined in the Explanation \nappended to the said Section, to mean: (i)\tany wilful conduct \nwhich is of such a nature as is likely to drive the woman to \ncommit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb \nor health whether mental or physical of the woman; or (ii) \nharassment of the woman where such harassment is with a \nview to coercing her or any person related to her to meet any \nunlawful demand for any property or valuable security or is on \naccount of failure by her or any person related to her to meet \nsuch demand.  Therefore, the consequences of \u0011\u0014cruelty\u0014, \nwhich are either likely to drive a woman to commit suicide or \nto cause grave injury, danger to life, limb or health, whether \nmental or physical of the woman or the harassment of a \nwoman, where such harassment is with a view to coercing her \nor any person related to her to meet any unlawful demand are \nrequired to be established in order to bring home an offence \nunder Section 498A I.P.C. \n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">18.\tIn the present case, from a plain reading of the complaint \nfiled by the complainant on 8.11.1994, extracted above, it is \nclear that the facts mentioned in the complaint, taken on their \nface value, do not make out a prima facie case against the \nappellants for having dishonestly misappropriated the \nStridhan of the complainant, allegedly handed over to them, \nthereby committing criminal breach of trust punishable under \n<a href=\"/doc/988620/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 406</a> I.P.C.  It is manifestly clear from the afore-\nextracted complaint as also the relevant portion of the charge-\nsheet that there is neither any allegation of entrustment of any \nkind of property by the complainant to the appellants nor its \nmisappropriation by them.  Furthermore, it is also noted in the \ncharge-sheet itself that the complainant had refused to take \narticles back when this offer was made to her by the \nInvestigating Officer.  Therefore, in our opinion, the very pre-\nrequisite of entrustment of the property and its \nmisappropriation by the appellants are lacking in the instant \ncase.  We have no hesitation in holding that the learned \nAdditional Sessions Judge and the High Court erred in law in \ncoming to the conclusion that a case for framing of charge \nunder <a href=\"/doc/988620/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 406</a> I.P.C. was made out.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">19.\tAs regards the applicability of <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 498A</a> I.P.C., in the \ncomplaint dated 8.11.1994 there is not even a whisper of a \nwilful conduct of appellants No. 1 and 2 of harassment of the \ncomplainant at their hands with a view to coercing her to meet \nany unlawful demand by them so as to attract the provisions \nof <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 498A</a> read with Explanation thereto. The complaint \nrefers to the talk the complainant purports to have had with \nher husband, appellant No. 3, who is alleged to have told her \nto come to Bijnore if she apologizes to his father; keeps him \nhappy; obeys his sister and talks to her father (complainant\u0012s) \nto give her Rs. 50,000/- and V.C.R. and brings these articles \nto Bijnore.  We are convinced that the allegation of \nmisbehaviour on the part of appellant Nos.1 and 2 and the \ndemand of Rs. 50,000/- and V.C.R. by them made by the \ncomplainant in her subsequent statement, dated 4.4.1995, \nwas an after thought and not bona fide.  <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 498A</a> I.P.C. \nwas introduced with the avowed object to combat the menace \nof dowry deaths and harassment to a woman at the hands of \nher husband or his relatives.  Nevertheless, the provision \nshould not be used as a device to achieve oblique motives. \nHaving carefully glanced through the complaint, the F.I.R. and \nthe charge-sheet, we find that charge under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 498A</a> \nI.P.C. is not brought home insofar as appellant Nos. 1 and 2 \nare concerned.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_17\">20.\tConsequently, we allow the appeal partly; quash the \ncharge framed against all the appellants under <a href=\"/doc/988620/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 406</a> \nI.P.C.; quash the charge framed against appellant Nos. 1 and 2 \nunder <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 498A</a> I.P.C. and dismiss the appeal of appellant \nNo. 3 against framing of charge under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 498A</a> I.P.C.   \nNeedless to add that the trial court shall now proceed with the \ntrial untrammeled by any observation made by the Additional \nSessions Judge and upheld by the High Court in the impugned \norder or by us in this judgment. \n</p>",
