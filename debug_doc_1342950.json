The appeal arises in the following circumstances:-\n</p>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">      The   respondent   no.   2   is   the   original   complainant. \n\n\n\nAccording   to   her,   the   petitioner   who   is   Sub-Inspector   of \n\n\n\nPolice,  cheated  her  and her  parents  by  stating that his first \n\n\n\nwife had died after delivering two children who are studying \n\n\n\nand   staying   in   a   hostel,   even  though   his  first   wife   by   name \n\n\n\nSharda   is   very   much   alive   and   living   with   him   at \n\n\f\n                                                                Reportable\n\n\n\nAvanthinagar near Erragadda and thus by making false and \n\n\n\nfraudulent representation, the appellant married with her at \n\n\n\nYadagirigutta on 09.10.1994.  The case of the respondent no. \n\n\n\n2   is   that   the   appellant   had   collected   total   amount   of \n\n\n\nRs.28,000/- from her father towards hand loan on the false \n\n\n\nplea   that   he   was   constructing   his   own  house   at   Borabanda \n\n\n\nand   the   appellant   further   demanded   a   sum   of   Rs.20,000/- \n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">from   her   father   and   when   her   father   expressed   inability   to \n\n\n\npay   the   amount,   the   appellant   threatened   the   complainant \n\n\n\nand   her   father   with   dire   consequences   by   showing   his \n\n\n\nlicensed   revolver.     According   to   the   complainant,   several \n\n\n\ntimes the appellant had tried to snatch away gold ornaments \n\n\n\nput on by her by threatening her with dire consequences and \n\n\n\nhad   demanded   gold   ornaments   together   with   cash   of \n\n\n\nRs.15,000/-   from   her   parents.     The   case   of   the   respondent \n\n\n\nno.   2   is   that   when   additional   demand   was   not   fulfilled   the \n\n\n\nappellant had threatened her and her father again by saying \n\n\n\nthat he would wipe out the evidence of his marriage with the \n\n\n\ncomplainant   which   had   taken   place   at   Yadagirigutta   by \n\n\n\ndestroying all the photographs and negatives and would walk \n\n\f\n                                                                   Reportable\n\n\n\nout   of   her   life.     Thus   feeling   aggrieved   by   the   acts   of   the \n\n\n\nappellant in cheating her, committing bigamy and meting out \n\n\n\ncruelty   to   her   for   dowry,   etc.,   the   respondent   no.   2   lodged \n\n\n\nFIR   dated   26.05.1995   with   Ranga   Reddy   Police   Station, \n\n\n\nBalanagar and prayed to take appropriate action against the \n\n\n\nappellant   for   alleged  commission   of   offences  under   <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_11\">Sections \n\n\n\n498A</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_12\">420</a> IPC.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">4.     The Investigating Officer, investigated the FIR lodged by \n\n\n\nthe   respondent   no.   2   and   submitted   charge   sheet   in   the \n\n\n\nCourt of learned Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Hyderabad, \n\n\n\nWest   and   South   Court,   R.R.District   at   Kothapet,   Sarunagar \n\n\n\nfor   commission   of   offences   punishable   under   <a href=\"/doc/508426/\" id=\"a_13\">Sections   494</a>, \n\n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/653145/\" id=\"a_14\">495</a>, <a href=\"/doc/105503/\" id=\"a_15\">417</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_16\">420</a> and <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_17\">498A</a> IPC.  On receipt of the charge sheet \n\n\n\nthe   learned   Magistrate   took   cognizance   of   the   offences   and \n\n\n\nsummoned   the   appellant.     The   record   shows   that   earlier \n\n\n\nCriminal Petition No. 812 of 2001 was filed by the appellant \n\n\n\nbefore   the   High   Court   to   quash   the   proceedings   initiated \n\n\n\npursuant to C.C. No. 820 of 1996 pending on the file of the \n\n\n\nlearned  Judicial Magistrate.    However, the said petition was \n\n\f\n                                                                     Reportable\n\n\n\nwithdrawn   by   the   appellant   and   therefore   the   petition   was \n\n\n\ndismissed   by   the   High   Court   vide   order   dated   09.04.2005 \n\n\n\nreserving     liberty   to   the   appellant   to   file   a   fresh   petition   in \n\n\n\ncase of necessity.          After   few   days   thereof,   the   appellant \n\n\n\nfiled Criminal Petition No. 2426 of 2005 in the High Court for \n\n\n\nquashing   the   proceedings   in   the   Criminal   Case   pending \n\n\n\nbefore the learned Magistrate.   The record does not indicate \n\n\n\nas   to   why   Criminal   Petition   No.   812   of   2001   filed   by   the \n\n\n\nappellant   in   which   similar   reliefs   as   claimed   in   Criminal \n\n\n\nPetition No. 2426 of 2005, were claimed, was withdrawn and \n\n\n\nwhich   were   the   new/additional   circumstances/grounds \n\n\n\nwhich   prompted   the   appellant   to   file   Criminal   Petition   No. \n\n\n\n2426   of   2005.       The   said   petition   was   filed   mainly   on   the \n\n\n\nground   that   the     proceedings   against   the   appellant   were \n\n\n\nregistered for commission of above mentioned offences on the \n\n\n\nbasis   of   charge   sheet   submitted   by   the   Sub-Inspector   of \n\n\n\nPolice,   Women   Police   Station,   Amberpet,   R.R.   District   and \n\n\n\nnot on the basis of complaint made by the aggrieved person \n\n\n\nwithin the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/373409/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 198</a> of the Code.   According to \n\n\n\nthe appellant the person aggrieved by alleged commission of \n\n\f\n                                                                  Reportable\n\n\n\noffences   under   <a href=\"/doc/508426/\" id=\"a_19\">Sections   494</a>   and   <a href=\"/doc/653145/\" id=\"a_20\">495</a>   is   his   wife   and \n\n\n\ncognizance  of  those   offences   could  have  been  taken   only on \n\n\n\nthe basis of the complaint filed by his wife in the Court or by \n\n\n\nsomeone   on   her   behalf   as   contemplated   by   Section   198A \n\n\n\n(1)(c) of the Code, and therefore, the learned Magistrate could \n\n\n\nnot  have  taken  cognizance   of  those   offences  on  the  basis   of \n\n\n\nsubmission of charge sheet by Sub-Inspector of Police on the \n\n\n\nbasis   of   the   investigation   into   the   FIR   lodged   by   the \n\n\n\nrespondent No. 2 who is not the aggrieved person within the \n\n\n\nmeaning   of   <a href=\"/doc/373409/\" id=\"a_21\">Section   198</a>   of   the   Code.     It   was   pleaded   that \n\n\n\nthere   was   no   averment   that   pursuant   to   deception   or \n\n\n\nfraudulent   or  dishonest   inducement  made  by   the   appellant, \n\n\n\nthere was any delivery or destruction of property belonging to \n\n\n\nthe original  complainant  and  therefore  <a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_22\">Section   420</a>  IPC  was \n\n\n\nnot   attracted.     It   was   the   case   of   the   appellant   that   the \n\n\n\nprovision of <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 498A</a> was also not attracted because the \n\n\n\nrespondent   no.   2  was   not   the   wife   of   the   appellant.     It   was \n\n\n\nalso   the   case   of   the   appellant   that   <a href=\"/doc/105503/\" id=\"a_24\">Section   417</a>   IPC   merged \n\n\n\ninto offence under <a href=\"/doc/653145/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 495</a> IPC which is a graver offence \n\n\n\nthan   <a href=\"/doc/105503/\" id=\"a_26\">Section   417</a>   and   as   there   were   no   allegations \n\n\f\n                                                                    Reportable\n\n\n\nconstituting  offence under  <a href=\"/doc/105503/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 417</a> IPC, the proceedings \n\n\n\ninitiated   for   alleged   commission   of   the   offences   should   be \n\n\n\nquashed.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">5.

However, in view of Clause (2) of \n\n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1930681/\" id=\"a_137\">Article   254</a>   of   the   Constitution,   an   undoubted   power   to \n\n\n\nlegislate, of course subject to assent of the President on the \n\n\f\n                                                                  Reportable\n\n\n\nsubject   already   in   existence,   is   available   to   the   State \n\n\n\nLegislature.   Clause (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1930681/\" id=\"a_138\">Article 254</a> is operative subject to \n\n\n\nprovisions of Clause (2).   If a law passes a test of Clause (2), \n\n\n\nit will make Clause (1) inapplicable to it.   To the general rule \n\n\n\nlaid down in Clause (1), Clause (2) engrafts an exception, viz., \n\n\n\nthat if the President assents to a State Law which has been \n\n\n\nreserved   for   his   consideration   as   required   by   <a href=\"/doc/1580975/\" id=\"a_139\">Article   200</a>,   it \n\n\n\nwill prevail notwithstanding its repugnancy to an earlier law \n\n\n\nof Union.  Clause (2) provides for curing of repugnancy which \n\n\n\nwould otherwise invalidate a State law which is inconsistent \n\n\n\nwith   a   Central   law   or   an   existing   law.     The   clause   provides \n\n\n\nthat   where   the   State   law   has   been   reserved   for   the \n\n\n\nconsideration   of   the   President   and   has   received   his   assent, \n\n\n\nthe   State   law   would   prevail   in   the   particular   State \n\n\n\nnotwithstanding   its   repugnancy   to   a   Central   law   or   an \n\n\n\nexisting law.   Clause (2) comes into play only when     (1) the \n\n\n\ntwo laws in question deal with a matter in Concurrent List (2) \n\n\n\nthe   State   law   has   been   made   with   the   consent   of   the \n\n\n\nPresident   and   (3)   the   provision   of   law   made   by   Parliament \n\n\n\nwas   earlier.     When   all   these   three   conditions   are   satisfied, \n\n\f\n                                                                  Reportable\n\n\n\nthe   law   made   by   the   State   Legislature   will   prevail.     Where \n\n\n\nthere is inconsistency between laws made by Parliament and \n\n\n\nlaws   made   by   the   State   Legislature,   the   law   made   by   the \n\n\n\nParliament shall prevail.   If the State makes law enumerated \n\n\n\nin   Concurrent   List   which   contains   provisions   repugnant   to \n\n\n\nthe   provision   of   an   earlier   law   made   by   the   Parliament,   the \n\n\n\nlaw so made by the State if it receives assent of President will \n\n\n\nprevail   in   the   State.       When   the   State   Act   prevails   under \n\n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/665535/\" id=\"a_140\">Article   254(2)</a>   over   a   Central   Act,   the   effect   is   merely   to \n\n\n\nsupersede the Central Act or to eclipse it by the State Act.  In \n\n\n\nshort, the result of obtaining the assent of the President to a \n\n\n\nState   Act   which   is   inconsistent   with   a   previous   Union   Law \n\n\n\nrelating to a concurrent subject would be that the State Act \n\n\n\nwill   prevail   in   that   State   and   overrule   the   provisions   of   the \n\n\n\nCentral Act, in that State.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_33\">      In   view   of   the   above   settled   legal   position,   this   Court \n\n\n\nhas   no   doubt   that   the   amendment   made   in   the   First \n\n\n\nSchedule   to   the   <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_141\">Code   of   Criminal   Procedure</a>,   1973   by   the \n\n\n\nCode   of   Criminal   Procedure   (Andhra   Pradesh   Second \n\n\n\nAmendment)   Act,  1992,   shall  prevail  in  the  State   of  Andhra \n\n\f\n                                                              Reportable\n\n\n\nPradesh,   notwithstanding   the   fact   that   in   the   <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_142\">Criminal \n\n\n\nProcedure   Code</a>,   1973   offences   under   Section   494   and   495 \n\n\n\nare   treated   as   cognizable   offences.

Such hairsplitting \n\nlegalistic         approach         would         encourage \n\nharassment   to   a   woman   over   demand   of \n\nmoney.     The   nomenclature   &quot;dowry&quot;   does   not \n\nhave   any   magic   charm   written   over   it.     It   is \n\njust   a   label   given   to   demand   of   money   in \n\nrelation   to   marital   relationship.                 The \n\nlegislative intent is clear from the fact that it \n\nis not only the husband but also his relations \n\nwho   are   covered   by   Section   498A.     The \n\nlegislature   has   taken   care   of   children   born \n\nfrom   invalid   marriages.     <a href=\"/doc/223527/\" id=\"a_194\">Section   16</a>   of   the \n\nMarriage Act deals with legitimacy of children \n\nof   void   and   voidable   marriages.     Can   it   be \n\nsaid that the legislature which was conscious \n\nof   the   social   stigma   attached   to   children   of \n\nvoid and voidable marriages closed its eyes to \n\nthe   plight   of   a   woman   who   unknowingly   or \n\nunconscious   of   the   legal   consequences \n\nentered into the marital relationship?  If such \n\nrestricted   meaning   is   given,   it   would   not \n\nfurther   the   legislative   intent.               On   the \n\ncontrary,   it   would   be   against   the   concern \n\nshown   by   the   legislature   for   avoiding \n\nharassment   to   a   woman   over   demand   of \n\nmoney   in   relation   to   marriages.     The   first \n\nexception   to   Section   494   has   also   some \n\nrelevance.     According   to   it,   the   offence   of \n\nbigamy   will   not   apply   to   &quot;any   person   whose \n\nmarriage with such husband or wife has been \n\ndeclared   void   by   a   court   of   competent \n\njurisdiction&quot;.     It   would   be   appropriate   to \n\nconstrue the expression &quot;husband&quot; to cover a \n\nperson   who   enters   into   marital   relationship \n\nand   under   the   colour   of   such   proclaimed   or \n\nfeigned   status   of   husband   subjects   the \n\nwoman concerned to cruelty or coerces her in \n\nany   manner   or   for   any   of   the   purposes \n\n\f\n                                                                  Reportable\n\n\n\n             enumerated   in   the   relevant   provisions- \n\n             Sections   304B/498A,   whatever   be   the \n\n             legitimacy   of   the   marriage   itself   for   the \n\n             limited   purpose   of   <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_195\">Sections   498A</a>   and   <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_196\">304B</a> \n\n             IPC.     Such   an   interpretation,   known   and \n\n             recognized   as   purposive   construction   has   to \n\n             come into play in a case of this nature.   The \n\n             absence   of   a   definition   of   &quot;husband&quot;   to \n\n             specifically   include   such   persons   who \n\n             contract   marriages   ostensibly   and   cohabit \n\n             with   such   woman,   in   the   purported   exercise \n\n             of   their   role   and   status   as   &quot;husband&quot;   is   no \n\n             ground   to   exclude   them   from   the   purview   of \n\n             Section   304B   or   498A   <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_197\">IPC</a>,   viewed   in   the \n\n             context   of   the   very   object   and   aim   of   the \n\n             legislations introducing those provisions.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_44\">17.    In view of firm and clear law laid down on the subject, \n\n\n\nthis Court is of the confirmed view that the High Court was \n\n\n\nnot   justified   at   all   in   quashing   the   proceedings   initiated \n\n\n\nagainst the appellant under Section 498A of the Code on the \n\n\n\nground   that   the   respondent   no.   2   was   not   wife   within   the \n\n\n\nmeaning  of <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_198\">Section 498A</a> of the IPC  and was not entitled  to \n\n\n\nmaintain   complaint  under   the  said   provision.    The  question \n\n\n\ntherefore   which   arises   for   consideration   of   the   Court   is \n\n\n\nwhether the said finding recorded by the High Court can and \n\n\n\nshould   be   set   aside   in   the   present   appeal   which   is   filed   by \n\n\f\n                                                                 Reportable\n\n\n\nthe husband.   It was argued by the learned Counsel for the \n\n\n\nappellant   that   quashing   of   proceedings   with   reference   to \n\n\n\noffence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_199\">Section 498A</a> of Indian Penal Code \n\n\n\nis   neither   challenged   by   the   State   Government   nor   by   the \n\n\n\noriginal  complainant before this Court and the same having \n\n\n\nattained finality, the same cannot be disturbed in an appeal \n\n\n\nfiled   by   the   husband   appellant   in   which   grievance   is   made \n\n\n\nregarding non-grant of relief in full by the High Court.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_45\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1180389\" id=\"span_3\">18.    This   Court   does   not   find   any   substance   in   the   above \n\n\n\nmentioned   argument   of   the   learned   Counsel   for   the \n\n\n\nappellant.   The law declared by this Court in case of  <a href=\"/doc/1180389/\" id=\"a_200\">Reema \n\n\nAggarwal</a>   (Supra)  was   binding   on   all   Court   including   the \n\n\nlearned   Single   Judge   of  High  Court  of  A.P.   who decided   the \n\n\n\npresent   case   in   view   of  salutary   provisions   of  <a href=\"/doc/882644/\" id=\"a_201\">Article   141</a>   of \n\n\n\nthe Constitution.</span>  The learned Single Judge of the High Court \n\n\n\ncould   not   have   afforded   to   ignore   the   law   declared   by   this \n\n\n\nCourt   in  Reema   Aggarwal   (Supra)  while   considering   the \n\n\n\nquestion whether proceedings initiated by the respondent no. \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_46\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1180389\" id=\"span_4\">2 for  commission   of  offence  punishable  under   Section  498A \n\n\f\n                                                                  Reportable\n\n\n\nof   <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_202\">IPC</a>   should   be   quashed   or   not.       The   High   Court   has \n\n\n\ncompletely misdirected itself in quashing the proceedings for \n\n\n\nthe offence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_203\">Section 498A</a> of IPC.   There is \n\n\n\nno   manner   of   doubt   that   the   finding   recorded   by   the   High \n\n\n\nCourt   that   the   respondent   no.   2   is   not   the   wife   within   the \n\n\n\nmeaning   of   <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_204\">Section   498A</a>   of   the   Indian   Penal   Code   runs \n\n\n\ncontrary   to   law   declared   by   this   Court   in   case   of  <a href=\"/doc/1180389/\" id=\"a_205\">Reema \n\n\nAggarwal</a>   (Supra).      There   may   be   several   reasons   due   to \n\n\nwhich   the   State   might   not   have   challenged   that   part   of   the \n\n\n\nJudgment   of   the   learned   Single   Judge   quashing   the \n\n\n\ncomplaint filed by the respondent no. 2 under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_206\">Section 498A</a> \n\n\n\nof the Indian Penal Code.  So also because of several reasons \n\n\n\nsuch   as   want   of   funds,   distance,   non-availability   of   legal \n\n\n\nadvice,   etc.   the   original   complainant   might   not   have \n\n\n\napproached this Court to challenge that part of the judgment \n\n\n\nof the learned Single Judge which is quite contrary to the law \n\n\n\ndeclared   by   this   Court.            However,   this   Court   while \n\n\n\nentertaining an appeal by grant of special leave has power to \n\n\n\nmould relief in favour of the respondents notwithstanding the \n\n\n\nfact   that   no   appeal   is   filed   by   any   of   the   respondents \n\n\f\n                                                              Reportable\n\n\n\nchallenging that part of the order which is against them.   To \n\n\n\nnotice an obvious error of law committed by the High Court \n\n\n\nand   thereafter   not   to   do   anything   in   the   matter   would   be \n\n\n\ntravesty of justice.   This Court  while  disposing  of  an appeal \n\n\n\narising   out   of   grant   of   special   leave   can   make   any   order \n\n\n\nwhich   justice   demands   and   one   who   has   obtained   illegal \n\n\n\norder would not be justified  in contending before this Court \n\n\n\nthat in absence of any appeal against illegal order passed by \n\n\n\nthe   High   Court   the   relief   should   not   be   appropriately \n\n\n\nmoulded by the Court or that the finding recorded should not \n\n\n\nbe upset by this Court.</span>\n</p>\n\n\n     \n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\"> 19.        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1598666\" id=\"span_5\">In <a href=\"/doc/1598666/\" id=\"a_207\">Chandrakant Patil Vs.

Though challenge  was  not  made \n\n\n\nby any of the two respondents to the finding recorded by the \n\n\n\nlearned   Single   Judge   that   the   complaint   lodged   by   the \n\n\f\n                                                                  Reportable\n\n\n\nrespondent   no.   2   for   alleged   commission   of   offence \n\n\n\npunishable   under   <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_215\">Section   498A</a>  of  the   Indian  Penal   Code   is \n\n\n\nnot  maintainable  because  she is not a wife,  this Court  feels \n\n\n\nthat   absence   of   challenge   either   by   State   or   by   the   original \n\n\n\ncomplainant should not persuade or prevent this Court from \n\n\n\ndoing justice between the parties by restoring the complaint \n\n\n\nfiled   by   the   respondent   no.   2   under   <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_216\">Section   498A</a>   of   the \n\n\n\nIndian Penal Code on the file of the learned Magistrate.   The \n\n\n\nconclusion arrived at by the High Court is such as to shake \n\n\n\nthe   conscience   and   sense   of   justice   and   therefore   it   is   the \n\n\n\nduty   of   this   Court   to   strike   down   the   finding   recorded   with \n\n\n\nrespect   to   the   offence   punishable   under   Section   498A, \n\n\n\nirrespective of technicalities.  The judgment of the High Court \n\n\n\nquashing the proceedings initiated by the learned Magistrate \n\n\n\nfor commission of offence punishable under Section 498A is \n\n\n\ntainted   with   serious   legal   infirmities   and   is   founded   on   a \n\n\n\nlegal   construction   which   is   wrong.     So   the   technical   plea \n\n\n\nadvanced   by   the   learned   counsel   for   the   appellant   that   in \n\n\n\nabsence   of   appeal   by   any   of   the   respondents,   quashing   of \n\n\n\nproceedings   with   respect   to   the   offence   punishable   under \n\n\f\n                                                                  Reportable\n\n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_217\">Section 498A</a> IPC, cannot be set aside, is hereby rejected.  As \n\n\n\nheld in  <a href=\"/doc/287275/\" id=\"a_218\">Ramakant Rai Vs. Madan Rail</a> (2003) 12 SCC 395 \n\n\n\nfollowing  <a href=\"/doc/158396/\" id=\"a_219\">Arunachalam   Vs.   P.S.R.

It   is   plenary   power \n\n\n\nexercisable   outside   the   purview   of   ordinary   law   to   meet   the \n\n\n\ndemand of justice.   <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_222\">Article 136</a> is a special jurisdiction.  It is \n\n\n\nresiduary   power.     It   is   extraordinary   in   its   amplitude.     The \n\n\n\nlimits of Supreme Court when it chases injustice, is the sky \n\n\n\nitself.

Where   there   is   manifest \n\n\n\ninjustice,   a   duty   is   enjoined   upon   this   Court   to   exercise   its \n\n\n\nsuo motu power by setting right the illegality in the judgment \n\n\n\nof the High Court as it is well settled that illegality should not \n\n\n\nbe   allowed   to   be   perpetuated   and   failure   by   this   Court   to \n\n\f\n                                                               Reportable\n\n\n\ninterfere with the same would amount to allow illegality to be \n\n\n\nperpetuated.  When an apparent irregularity is found by this \n\n\n\nCourt   in   the   order   passed   by   the   High   Court,   the   Supreme \n\n\n\nCourt   cannot   ignore   substantive   rights   of   a   litigant   while \n\n\n\ndealing   with   the   cause   pending   before   it.         There   is   no \n\n\n\nreason   why   the   relief   cannot   be   and   should   not   be \n\n\n\nappropriately   moulded   while   disposing   of   an   appeal   arising \n\n\n\nby   grant   of   special   leave   under   <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_224\">Article   136</a>   of   the \n\n\n\nConstitution.</span></span></span>   \n</p>\n\n\n \n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_50\">20.
