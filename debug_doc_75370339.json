In order to satisfy its obligations under the Agreement, the Accused\n\ncompany issued post-dated cheque of Rs. 25,47,945/- bearing cheque\n\nnumber 090656 dated 15.02.2016, drawn on Indian Overseas Bank, Kalupur\n\nCircle Branch, Railway Pura, Ahmedabad, towards the payment of one of\n\nthe instalments.

On 19.04.2016, a demand-cum-legal notice under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 138</a> of\n\nNegotiable Instruments Act, 1881, (hereinafter referred to as ‘the <a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_3\">NI Act</a>’)\n\nwas issued on behalf of the Respondent calling upon the company as\n\nAccused no.1 and the Appellant herein as Accused no. 2 to settle the debt\n\nadvanced by way of corporate loan dated 27.03.2012. The Accused\n\nacknowledged their liability to pay the loan amount vide reply dated\n\n28.04.2016. The amount was not paid and, thus, on 16.05.2016, Criminal\n\nComplaint No. 632982/2016 was filed in the Court of Chief Metropolitan\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                                                      2</span>\n\fMagistrate, Saket Courts, New Delhi, under <a href=\"/doc/686759/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 190</a> of the Code of\n\nCriminal Procedure, 1973, read with <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 138</a> <a href=\"/doc/621484/\" id=\"a_6\">1</a>, Section 1412 and <a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_7\">Section\n\n1423</a> of the NI Act. The complaint was signed and verified by Mr. N.\n\nRamachandran, Deputy General Manager (Law) of the Respondent\n\ncompany. An endeavor for mediation was made but was not successful and,\n\nthus, the next date was scheduled before the Magistrate for 15.01.2018. In\n\nthe meantime, a development, which took place, was that in 2017 M/s\n\nNeeraj Paper Agencies Limited, styling itself as ‘Operational Creditor’, filed\n\nan application under <a href=\"/doc/1680872/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 9</a> of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code,\n\n2016 (hereinafter referred to as ‘IBC’) read with Rule 6 of Insolvency and\n\nBankruptcy      (Application      to Adjudicating Authority)              Rules,   2016,\n\n(hereinafter referred to as ‘IB Rules, 2016’) with the request to initiate\n\nCorporate Insolvency Resolution Process against the Accused company,\n\ntreating it as the &#x27;Corporate Debtor&#x27;. The National Company Law Tribunal\n\nvide order dated 12.09.2017 admitted the aforesaid insolvency application.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">4.     The Respondent herein filed its claim qua the debt, which was the\n\nsubject matter of the <a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_9\">N.I. Act</a> proceedings, on 13.10.2017. In terms of the\n\nResolution Plan dated 26.05.2018, the Resolution Applicant (Kushal\n\nLimited) filed the Resolution Plan and during the course of meeting the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">1</span>\n  Dishonour of cheque for insufficiency, etc., of funds in the account.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">2</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">  Offences by companies.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">3</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">  Cognizance of offences.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                                                                    3</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">\fCommittee of Creditors on 05.06.2018, it was informed that the respondent\n\nherein could not be considered as a Secured Financial Creditor as per\n\ndefinitions contained in <a href=\"/doc/1485731/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 3(30)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1485731/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 3(31)</a> of the IBC. In\n\neffect, on legal advice, the Respondent was opined as an Unsecured\n\nFinancial Creditor. This resulted in the Respondent filing applications, in\n\nthe form of objections, before the NCLAT where the status was sought to be\n\nchanged from the Unsecured to Secured Financial Creditor.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_10\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"196282971\" id=\"span_13\">5.    Now turning back to the NIA proceedings, the Metropolitan\n\nMagistrate passed an interim order dated 12.11.2018 dismissing the\n\napplication of the Appellant for exemption from personal appearance. This,\n\nin turn, was predicated on the observations of NCLAT in <a href=\"/doc/196282971/\" id=\"a_12\">Shah Brothers\n\nIspat Pvt. Ltd. Vs P. Mohan Raj &amp;Ors</a>, Company Appeal (AT) Insolvency\n\nNo.306 of 2018, opining that <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 138</a> of NI Act is a penal provision,\n\nwhich empowers the court of competent jurisdiction to pass order of\n\nimprisonment or fine, which cannot be held to be proceedings or any\n\njudgment or decree of money claim. Thus, it would not come within the\n\npurview of <a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 14</a> of the IBC and, thus, the proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_15\">Section\n\n138</a> of the NI Act, 1881 could continue simultaneously.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">6.    The Appellant, thus, filed an application for discharge of the\n\nComplaint Case in question herein in the present case, which was dismissed\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                                                       4</span>\n\fby the Metropolitan Magistrate vide order dated 01.11.2019. The Criminal\n\nRevision Petition preferred by the Appellant bearing Criminal Revision\n\nPetition No. 784 of 2019 also met with a similar fate before the High Court\n\nand was dismissed with cost of Rs. 20,000/- to be paid by the Appellant to\n\nthe Respondent. It is this order, which is now, sought to be assailed before\n\nus.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">Appellant’s submissions:\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_13\">7.    Mr. Nikhil Goel, learned counsel, sought to urge on behalf of the\n\nappellant that the trigger of <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act, is the non-payment of\n\nlegally enforceable debt. Once the debt is itself extinguished, either under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1343737/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 31</a> or in process from <a href=\"/doc/717368/\" id=\"a_18\">Sections 38</a> to <a href=\"/doc/1932246/\" id=\"a_19\">41</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1646266/\" id=\"a_20\">54</a> of IBC, the basis of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act disappears. We may note that these provisions fall\n\nunder Chapter III4 of the IBC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">8.       The term ‘Debt’ would mean ‘legally enforceable debt’ under the\n\nExplanation to <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act and this may be read with <a href=\"/doc/328668/\" id=\"a_23\">Sections\n\n2(6)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/328668/\" id=\"a_24\">2(8)</a> of the IBC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_15\">9.       It was submitted that the nature of the proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 138</a>\n\nof the NI Act is primarily compensatory in nature and the punitive element\n\nis incorporated at enforcing the compensatory provisions. Therefore, once\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">4</span>\n    Liquidation Process\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                                                          5</span>\n\frecovery is made partly by the receipt of money and partly by waiver,\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act should not be permitted to be continued.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_16\">10.   It was lastly urged that if the debt of the company is resolved then the\n\npayment would be governed under the Resolution Plan. If the debts are not\n\nresolved, then the assets of the company are to be distributed in terms of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1927368/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 53</a> of the IBC.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_17\">Plea of the Respondent:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_18\">11.   On behalf of the Respondent, it was urged that the cheque was\n\ngiven for repayment of the aforementioned loan amount of Rs.30 crore\n\nfor which the accused company agreed to repay the principal amount in\n\ntwo installments with first installment of Rs.10 crore payable on\n\n31.03.2015 and the second installment of Rs.20 crore payable on\n\n31.03.2016. The accused company had to pay interest @ 15 per cent per\n\nannum on the said principal amount of loan and such interest was payable\n\nmonthly on the 15th day of every month, which was in consonance with\n\nthe dates and the cheque amount.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_19\">12.   It was urged that the accused company along with the Appellant\n\ndeliberately and with the mala fide intention gave the cheque to defraud\n\nthe Respondent to take loan from it and subsequently to usurp the loan\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                                                         6</span>\n\famount and hence had closed the bank account. The Appellant being the\n\nsignatory was directly liable along with the accused company. The\n\nAppellant was actively involved in the day to day affairs of the company\n\nas can be inferred from the aforementioned loan agreement signed by\n\nhim as well.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_20\">Our View:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">13.   We may note that on 20.09.2022 with some of the SLPs being\n\nwithdrawn, in respect of the SLPs in question, the interim order was\n\nmade absolute with the direction for urgent listing as criminal\n\nproceedings had been stayed. Learned counsel for the parties stated that\n\nthey will file short synopsis not running into more than three pages each\n\nand will not take more than 15-20 minutes each for their respective\n\nsubmissions. On the conspectus of the aforesaid we heard the arguments\n\non 17.01.2023 when we granted leave and reserved the judgment.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_22\">14.   The Appellant had submitted the synopsis in advance. The\n\nRespondent however, despite assuring that they would submit the\n\nsynopsis has not cared to do so and we have gone on the basis of the\n\nrecord. This position is prevalent right till 12.03.2023 and we do not\n\nconsider it appropriate to wait any more. We assume that the Respondent\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                                                       7</span>\n\fis not interested in rendering any further assistance to the Court by filing\n\nsynopsis. Fortunately for them, for the reasons to be recorded hereinafter,\n\nthey have not really suffered the consequences thereof.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_23\">15.   The issue whether the respondent is a Secured Financial Creditor\n\nor an Unsecured Financial Creditor within the meaning of the said Code\n\nis not something we can deal with as that is the matter of the proceedings\n\nunder the said Code or any appeal preferred therefrom. The only issue\n\nwith which we are concerned with is whether during the pendency of the\n\nproceedings under the said Code which have been admitted, the present\n\nproceedings under the <a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_28\">N.I. Act</a> can continue simultaneously or not.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_24\">16.   We have no hesitation in coming to the conclusion that the scope\n\nof nature of proceedings under the two Acts and quite different and\n\nwould not intercede each other. In fact, a bare reading of <a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 14</a> of\n\nthe IBC would make it clear that the nature of proceedings which have to\n\nbe kept in abeyance do not include criminal proceedings, which is the\n\nnature of proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 138</a> of the N.I. Act. We are unable\n\nto appreciate the plea of the learned counsel for the Appellant that\n\nbecause <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 138</a> of the N.I. Act proceedings arise from a default in\n\nfinancial debt, the proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 138</a> should be taken as akin\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                                                          8</span>\n\fto civil proceedings rather than criminal proceedings. We cannot lose\n\nsight of the fact that <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 138</a> of the N.I. Act are not recovery\n\nproceedings. They are penal in character. A person may face\n\nimprisonment or fine or both under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 138</a> of the N.I. Act. It is not\n\na recovery of the amount with interest as a debt recovery proceedings\n\nwould be. They are not akin to suit proceedings.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_25\">17.   It cannot be said that the process under the IBC whether under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1343737/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 31</a> or <a href=\"/doc/717368/\" id=\"a_36\">Sections 38</a> to <a href=\"/doc/1932246/\" id=\"a_37\">41</a> which can extinguish the debt would ipso\n\nfacto apply to the extinguishment of the criminal proceedings. No doubt\n\nin terms of the Scheme under the IBC there are sacrifices to be made by\n\nparties to settle the debts, the company being liquidated or revitalized.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_26\">The Appellant before us has been roped in as a signatory of the cheque as\n\nwell as the Promoter and Managing Director of the Accused company,\n\nwhich availed of the loan. The loan agreement was also signed by him on\n\nbehalf of the company. What the Appellant seeks is escape out of\n\ncriminal liability having defaulted in payment of the amount at a very\n\nearly stage of the loan. In fact, the loan account itself was closed. So\n\nmuch for the bona fides of the Appellant.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                                                        9</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_27\">\f18.   We are unable to accept the plea that if proceedings against the\n\ncompany come to an end then the Appellant as the Managing Director\n\ncannot be proceeded against. We are unable to accept the plea that\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 138</a> of the N.I. Act proceedings are primarily compensatory in\n\nnature and that the punitive element is incorporated only at enforcing the\n\ncompensatory proceedings. The criminal liability and the fines are built\n\non the principle of not honouring a negotiable instrument, which affects\n\ntrade. This is apart from the principle of financial liability per se. To say\n\nthat under a scheme which may be approved, a part amount will be\n\nrecovered or if there is no scheme a person may stand in a queue to\n\nrecover debt would absolve the consequences under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 138</a> of the\n\nN.I. Act, is unacceptable.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">19.

This appeal by special leave is at the instance of the original accused No. 2 in a\ncomplaint lodged by the respondent herein (original complainant) for the offence\npunishable under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 138</a> of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (for short, ‘the\n<a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_41\">NI Act</a>’) and is directed against the order passed by the Additional Sessions Judge-02\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">\f                                                                                           2</span>\n\n\nSouth East District, Saket Court, New Delhi dated 23.11.2019 in the Criminal\nRevision Application No. 593 of 2019 by which the Additional Sessions Judge\naffirmed the order passed by the Metropolitan Magistrate – 09, SED dated 01.11.2019\nrejecting the application filed by the appellant herein seeking discharge from the\ncriminal proceedings i.e. Complaint Case No. 632984 of 2016 instituted by the\nrespondent-complainant under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">4.    It is necessary to clarify why the appellant challenged the impugned order\npassed by the Additional Sessions Judge directly before this Court invoking <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_43\">Article\n136</a> of the Constitution of India. In this regard, the following averments made in the\nsynopsis are reproduced hereinbelow:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">        “The petitioner is directly approaching this Hon’ble Court, because the\n        first two facets are already being considered by this Hon’ble Court, in\n        which view, the Hon’ble High Court is not likely to entertain a quashing\n        petition. This apart, a petition before any other court is likely to result in\n        conflicting orders and would be an exercise in futility. The earlier matters\n        pending before this Hon’ble Court also arose directly out of the summons\n        issued by the concerned Learned Magistrate.”\n\nFACTUAL MATRIX\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">5.    The respondent herein, namely, the “Tourism Finance Corporation of India\nLimited” (hereinafter shall be referred to as, ‘the complainant’), had advanced a sum\nof Rs. 30,00,00,000/- (thirty crore) as a corporate loan to the Rainbow Papers Limited\n(Original Accused No. 1/corporate debtor). The appellant herein at the relevant point\nof time was the Managing Director of the company i.e. the corporate debtor. The\ntransaction between the parties took place on 31.03.2012. It appears that an amount of\nRs. 10.88 crore came to be repaid before the disputes arose between the parties.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_35\">Sometime in 2016, the complainant issued a notice to the corporate debtor to settle the\nbalance amount. On 16.05.2016, a complaint was lodged under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 138</a> of the NI\nAct by the complainant against the corporate debtor and the appellant herein\n(Managing Director of the Corporate Debtor) for dishonour of the three cheques issued\nby the appellant herein for discharge of the debt in part to the tune of Rs. 57,00,000/-\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">\f                                                                                            3</span>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_36\">(fifty-seven lakhs).\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_37\">6.

It appears that in the meantime, the appellant preferred an application before the\ntrial court seeking exemption from his personal appearance invoking a moratorium\nunder <a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 14</a> of the IBC. The Magistrate vide order dated 12.11.2018 rejected the\nsaid application on the ground that the criminal proceedings under the <a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_48\">NI Act</a> had\nnothing to do with the proceedings under the IBC.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_45\">14.

As the resolution plan came to be approved by the NCLT, the appellant herein\nfiled an application dated 20.07.2019 before the trial court, praying that he be\ndischarged from the criminal proceedings. The case of the appellant herein before the\nMagistrate was that as the debt stood settled in the proceedings under the IBC, the\ncriminal proceedings would not survive.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_47\">16.

The appellant\ncontended before the revisional court that as the debt in connection with which the\ncriminal proceedings had been initiated, formed part of the approved resolution plan\nthe outstanding debt under the <a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_49\">NI Act</a> could be said to have stood settled.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_49\">18.

Mr. Nikhil Goel, the learned counsel appearing for the appellant made the\nfollowing submissions:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">      A.      The trigger of <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_50\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act, is the non-payment of legally\n      enforceable debt. Once the debt itself gets extinguished either under <a href=\"/doc/1343737/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 31</a>\n      of the IBC or in the process from <a href=\"/doc/717368/\" id=\"a_52\">Sections 38</a> to <a href=\"/doc/1932246/\" id=\"a_53\">41</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1646266/\" id=\"a_54\">54</a> resply of the IBC, the\n      basis of <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act no longer remains. The term debt would mean\n      the ‘legally enforceable debt’ under the explanation to <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_56\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act.\n      This may be read with <a href=\"/doc/328668/\" id=\"a_57\">Section 2(6)</a> &amp; <a href=\"/doc/328668/\" id=\"a_58\">2(8)</a> resply of the IBC.\n      B.      The liability is primarily of the company and prosecution of natural\n      persons under <a href=\"/doc/686130/\" id=\"a_59\">Section 141</a> of the NI Act is vicarious to the prosecution of the\n      company. It is for this reason that a director cannot be prosecuted without making\n      the company as an accused. [See Ajit Balse v. Ranga Karkere: (2015) 15 SCC\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">      748.]\n      C.      The nature of proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_60\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act is primarily\n      compensatory and the punitive element is incorporated at enforcing the\n      compensatory provisions. (paras 53 &amp; 63 resply in P. Mohanraj and Others v.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">\f                                                                                           5</span>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_53\">      Shah Brothers Ispat Private Limited reported in (2021) 6 SCC 258). Therefore,\n      once recovery is made, partly by receipt of money and partly by waiver, <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_61\">Section\n      138</a> of the NI Act should not be permitted to be continued.\n      D. If the debt of the company is resolved then payments would be governed\n      under the resolution plan. If the debts are not resolved then the assets of the\n      company are to be distributed in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1927368/\" id=\"a_62\">Section 53</a> of the IBC. Permitting two\n      proceedings to continue would therefore defeat either Section 31 or Section 53 of\n      the IBC, as the case may be.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_54\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"196282971\" id=\"span_28\">E.        Mr. Goel submitted that this Court in <a href=\"/doc/196282971/\" id=\"a_63\">P. Mohanraj</a> (supra) considered the\n      position of law as regards the continuation of the criminal proceedings under\n      <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_64\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act vis-a-vis the proceedings under the IBC and answered\n      the same in para 102 of the judgment. It was pointed out by Mr. Goel that this\n      Court drew a fine distinction between the corporate debtor and natural persons &amp;\n      ultimately held that while a corporate debtor would be protected from <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_65\">Section\n      138</a> proceedings during the period of moratorium, the natural persons would not\n      enjoy such protection and <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_66\">Section 138</a> proceedings would continue against the\n      natural persons. However, according to Mr. Goel, this Court may not go in the\n      correctness of such bifurcation as in the case on hand, the proceedings are\n      beyond the period of moratorium.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"196282971\" id=\"span_29\">Mr. Goel pointed out that the question framed\n      in para 6 of the decision in <a href=\"/doc/196282971/\" id=\"a_67\">P. Mohanraj</a> (supra) is restricted only to the\n      applicability of <a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_68\">Section 14</a> of the IBC to the proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_69\">Section 138</a> of the\n      NI Act.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_55\">      F.        The principal argument of Mr. Goel is that if the IBC proceedings have\n      travelled beyond <a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_70\">Section 14</a>, the process would either lead to acceptance of a\n      resolution plan under <a href=\"/doc/1343737/\" id=\"a_71\">Section 31</a> of the IBC or liquidation of the company after\n      determination of the claims under Chapter III of the IBC. According to Mr. Goel,\n      <a href=\"/doc/1343737/\" id=\"a_72\">Section 31</a> of the IBC is applicable to the present litigation.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_56\">21.    In such circumstances <a href=\"/doc/196282971/\" id=\"a_73\">referred to above</a>, Mr. Goel prays that there being merit\nin his appeal, the same may be allowed and the appellant may be discharged from the\ncriminal liability under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_74\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">\f                                                                                             6</span>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_57\">THE SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT (COMPLAINANT)\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_58\">22.    On the other hand, this appeal has been vehemently opposed by Mr. Rajiv\nRanjan Dwivedi, the learned counsel appearing for the complainant by submitting that\nin the case on hand, the criminal proceedings under the <a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_75\">NI Act</a> were initiated much\nbefore the proceedings under the IBC came to be initiated. In other words, cognizance\nwas taken by the learned Magistrate upon the complaint filed under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_76\">Section 138</a> of the\nNI Act much before the scheme came to be approved under the IBC. He would submit\nthat the offence alleged to have been committed by the appellant herein prior to the\nscheme would not get automatically compounded only as a result of the said scheme.\nHe would further submit that none of the provisions of the IBC bars the continuation\nof the criminal prosecution initiated against the corporate debtor or its directors or\nofficials. According to the learned counsel, if the company is dissolved as a result of\nthe resolution process, the criminal proceedings against it would stand terminated,\nhowever, the signatory to the cheque or its erstwhile directors are not entitled in law to\ntake advantage of such a situation created by operation of law.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_59\">23.    The learned counsel appearing for the complainant, laid much stress on Section\n32A of the IBC, which states that every person who was a ‘designated partner’ or an\n‘officer who is in default’ or was in any manner in charge of/responsible to the\ncorporate debtor for the conduct of its business or associated with the corporate debtor\nin any manner and who was directly or indirectly involved in the commission of such\noffence in accordance with the report submitted or complaint filed by the investigating\nauthority shall continue to be liable to be prosecuted and punished for such an offence\ncommitted by the corporate debtor notwithstanding that the corporate debtor’s liability\nhas ceased under the provision of Section 32A of the IBC.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_60\">24.    In such circumstances<a href=\"/doc/196282971/\" id=\"a_77\">, <a href=\"/doc/196282971/\" id=\"a_78\">referred to above</a></a>, the learned counsel prays that there\nbeing no merit in the present appeal, the same may be dismissed.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_61\">ANALYSIS\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_62\">25.

The Statement of Objects and Reasons of the IBC indicates that the Legislature\nwas of the opinion that the existing framework for insolvency and bankruptcy was\ninadequate and ineffective and resulted in undue delays in resolution. The IBC was\nproposed with the objective of consolidating and amending the laws relating to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">\f                                                                                           11</span>\n\n\nreorganisation and insolvency resolution of corporate persons, partnership firms and\nindividuals in a time bound manner for maximisation of the value of assets of such\npersons, to promote entrepreneurship, availability of credit and balance the interests of all\nthe stakeholders, including alteration in the priority of payment of Government dues and\nto establish an Insolvency and Bankruptcy Fund, and matters connected therewith or\nincidental thereto. The IBC provides for designating the NCLT and the Debts Recovery\nTribunal (DRT) as the adjudicating authorities for corporate persons, firms and\nindividuals for resolution of insolvency, liquidation and bankruptcy. The IBC was\npublished in the Gazette of India dated 28.05.2016.

The financial creditor may file an application before the\nadjudicating authority along with the proof of default and the name of a resolution\nprofessional proposed to act as the interim resolution professional in respect of the\ncorporate debtor.

In\nfact, even when the resolution professional is to make a “determination”\nunder Regulation 35-A, he is only to apply to the adjudicating authority for\nappropriate relief based on the determination made as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_62\">  “35-A.

As opposed to this, the liquidator, in liquidation proceedings under the\n  Code, has to consolidate and verify the claims, and either admit or reject\n  such claims under <a href=\"/doc/717368/\" id=\"a_136\">Sections 38</a> to <a href=\"/doc/339685/\" id=\"a_137\">40</a> of the Code. <a href=\"/doc/1932246/\" id=\"a_138\">Sections 41</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1218058/\" id=\"a_139\">42</a>, by\n  way of contrast between the powers of the liquidator and that of the\n  resolution professional, are set out hereinbelow:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_64\">       “41. Determination of valuation of claims.—The liquidator shall\n     determine the value of claims admitted under <a href=\"/doc/339685/\" id=\"a_140\">Section 40</a> in such\n     manner as may be specified by the Board.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_65\">       42.

Unlike the liquidator, the resolution professional cannot act in a\n           number of matters without the approval of the Committee of Creditors\n           under <a href=\"/doc/1305997/\" id=\"a_143\">Section 28</a> of the Code, which can, by a two-thirds majority, replace\n           one resolution professional with another, in case they are unhappy with\n           his performance. Thus, the resolution professional is really a facilitator of\n           the resolution process, whose administrative functions are overseen by the\n           Committee of Creditors and by the adjudicating authority.”\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_116\">(d)    <a href=\"/doc/1339321/\" id=\"a_144\">Section 29</a> of the IBC deals with the information memorandum on the basis of\nwhich the resolution plan would be submitted.

The aforesaid provisions of the Code are then fleshed out in the 2016\nRegulations. Under Chapter IV of the aforesaid Regulations, claims by\noperational creditors, financial creditors, other creditors, workmen and\nemployees are to be submitted to the resolution professional along with proofs\nthereof — see Regulations 7 to 12. Thereafter, under <a href=\"/doc/1275897/\" id=\"a_154\">Regulation 13</a>, the\nresolution professional shall verify each claim as on the insolvency\ncommencement date, and thereupon maintain a list of creditors containing the\nnames of creditors along with the amounts claimed by them, the amounts\nadmitted by him, and the security interest, if any, in respect of such claims,\nand constantly update the aforesaid list — see <a href=\"/doc/1036701/\" id=\"a_155\">Regulation 13(1)</a>.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_72\">44.

We have further discussed the\n        statutory scheme of IBC in Sections I and J of this judgment to establish that\n        a resolution plan is binding inter se the CoC and the successful resolution\n        applicant.

The reverence courts justifiably hold such laws in cannot but be\n        applicable in the instant case as well. The provision deals with reference to\n        offences committed prior to the commencement of the CIRP.

Further, the powers of the Board of\n           Directors or partners of the corporate debtor stand suspended, and are\n           to be exercised by the interim resolution professional.

At the same time, the Committee was also conscious\nthat authorities are duty-bound to penalise the commission of any\noffence, especially in cases involving substantial public interest. Thus,\ntwo competing concerns need to be balanced.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_129\">       Xxx                             xxx                        xxx\n17.6. Given this, the Committee felt that a distinction must be drawn\nbetween the corporate debtor which may have committed offences under\nthe control of its previous management, prior to the CIRP, and the\ncorporate debtor that is resolved, and taken over by an unconnected\nresolution applicant. While the corporate debtor&#x27;s actions prior to the\ncommencement of the CIRP must be investigated and penalised, the\nliability must be affixed only upon those who were responsible for the\ncorporate debtor&#x27;s actions in this period. However, the new management\nof the corporate debtor, which has nothing to do with such past offences,\nshould not be penalised for the actions of the erstwhile management of\nthe corporate debtor, unless they themselves were involved in the\ncommission of the offence, or were related parties, promoters or other\npersons in management and control of the corporate debtor at the time\nof or any time following the commission of the offence, and could\nacquire the corporate debtor, notwithstanding the prohibition under\nSection 29-A. [For example, where the exemption under Section 240-A is\napplicable.]\n17.7. Thus, the Committee agreed that a new section should be inserted\nto provide that where the corporate debtor is successfully resolved, it\nshould not be held liable for any offence committed prior to the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">\f                                                                                   25</span>\n\n\n  commencement of the CIRP, unless the successful resolution applicant\n  was also involved in the commission of the offence, or was a related\n  party, promoter or other person in management and control of the\n  corporate debtor at the time of or any time following the commission of\n  the offence.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_130\">  17.8.

This Court in <a href=\"/doc/54883247/\" id=\"a_211\">Manish Kumar v. Union of India</a> [(2021) 5 SCC 1],\nupheld the constitutional validity of this provision. This Court observed :</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_111\">(SCC pp. 170-71, para 326)\n\n  “326. We are of the clear view that no case whatsoever is made out to\n  seek invalidation of Section 32-A. The boundaries of this Court&#x27;s\n  jurisdiction are clear. The wisdom of the legislation is not open to\n  judicial review. Having regard to the object of the Code, the experience\n  of the working of the Code, the interests of all stakeholders including\n  most importantly the imperative need to attract resolution applicants\n  who would not shy away from offering reasonable and fair value as part\n  of the resolution plan if the legislature thought that immunity be granted\n  to the corporate debtor as also its property, it hardly furnishes a ground\n  for this Court to interfere. The provision is carefully thought out. It is not\n  as if the wrongdoers are allowed to get away. They remain liable. The\n  extinguishment of the criminal liability of the corporate debtor is\n  apparently important to the new management to make a clean break with\n  the past and start on a clean slate. We must also not overlook the\n  principle that the impugned provision is part of an economic measure.\n  The reverence courts justifiably hold such laws in cannot but be\n  applicable in the instant case as well. The provision deals with reference\n  to offences committed prior to the commencement of the CIRP. With the\n  admission of the application the management of the corporate debtor\n  passes into the hands of the interim resolution professional and\n  thereafter into the hands of the resolution professional subject\n  undoubtedly to the control by the Committee of Creditors. As far as\n  protection afforded to the property is concerned there is clearly a\n  rationale behind it. Having regard to the object of the statute we hardly\n  see any manifest arbitrariness in the provision.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_132\">41. Section 32-A cannot possibly be said to throw any light on the true in-\nterpretation of <a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_212\">Section 14(1)(a)</a> as the reason for introducing Section 32-A\nhad nothing whatsoever to do with any moratorium provision. At the heart\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_65\">\f                                                                                26</span>\n\n\nof the section is the extinguishment of criminal liability of the corporate\ndebtor, from the date the resolution plan has been approved by the adjudi-\ncating authority, so that the new management may make a clean break with\nthe past and start on a clean slate. A moratorium provision, on the other\nhand, does not extinguish any liability, civil or criminal, but only casts a\nshadow on proceedings already initiated and on proceedings to be initiated,\nwhich shadow is lifted when the moratorium period comes to an end. Also,\nSection 32-A(1) operates only after the moratorium comes to an end. At the\nheart of Section 32-A is the IBC&#x27;s goal of value maximisation and the need\nto obviate lower recoveries to creditors as a result of the corporate debtor\ncontinuing to be exposed to criminal liability.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_133\">42. Unfortunately, Section 32-A is inelegantly drafted. The second proviso\nto Section 32-A(1) speaks of persons who are in any manner in charge of,\nor responsible to the corporate debtor for the conduct of its business or as-\nsociated with the corporate debtor and who are, directly or indirectly, in-\nvolved in the commission of “such offence” i.e. the offence referred to in\nsub-section (1), “as per the report submitted or complaint filed by the in-\nvestigating authority …”. The report submitted here refers to a police re-\nport under <a href=\"/doc/1412034/\" id=\"a_213\">Section 173</a> CrPC, and complaints filed by investigating author-\nities under special Acts, as opposed to private complaints. If the language\nof the second proviso is taken to interpret the language of <a href=\"/doc/1578249/\" id=\"a_214\">Section 32-</a> A(1)\nin that the “offence committed” under Section 32-A(1) would not include\noffences based upon complaints under <a href=\"/doc/255245/\" id=\"a_215\">Section 2(d)</a> CrPC, the width of the\nlanguage would be cut down and the object of Section 32-A(1) would not be\nachieved as all prosecutions emanating from private complaints would be\nexcluded. Obviously, Section 32-A(1) cannot be read in this fashion and\nclearly incudes the liability of the corporate debtor for all offences com-\nmitted prior to the commencement of the corporate insolvency resolution\nprocess. Doubtless, a <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_216\">Section 138</a> proceeding would be included, and\nwould, after the moratorium period comes to an end with a resolution plan\nby a new management being approved by the adjudicating authority, cease\nto be an offence qua the corporate debtor.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_134\">43. A section which has been introduced by an amendment into an Act\nwith its focus on cesser of liability for offences committed by the corporate\ndebtor prior to the commencement of the corporate insolvency resolution\nprocess cannot be so construed so as to limit, by a sidewind as it were, the\nmoratorium provision contained in <a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_217\">Section 14</a>, with which it is not at all\nconcerned. If the first proviso to Section 32-A(1) is read in the manner\nsuggested by Shri Mehta, it will impact <a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_218\">Section 14</a> by taking out of its\nken <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_219\">Sections 138</a>/<a href=\"/doc/686130/\" id=\"a_220\">141</a> proceedings, which is not the object of <a href=\"/doc/1578249/\" id=\"a_221\">Section 32-</a>\nA(1) at all. Assuming, therefore, that there is a clash between <a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_222\">Section 14</a>\nIBC and the first proviso of Section 32-A(1), this clash is best resolved\nby applying the doctrine of harmonious construction so that the objects\nof both the provisions get subserved in the process, without damaging or\nlimiting one provision at the expense of the other. If, therefore, the ex-\npression “prosecution” in the first proviso of Section 32-A(1) refers to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">\f                                                                                        27</span>\n\n\n        criminal proceedings properly so-called either through the medium of a\n        first information report or complaint filed by an investigating authority\n        or complaint and not to quasi-criminal proceedings that are instituted\n        under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_223\">Sections 138</a>/<a href=\"/doc/686130/\" id=\"a_224\">141</a> of the Negotiable Instruments Act against the\n        corporate debtor, the object of <a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_225\">Section 14(1)</a> IBC gets subserved, as does\n        the object of Section 32-A, which does away with criminal prosecutions\n        in all cases against the corporate debtor, thus absolving the corporate\n        debtor from the same after a new management comes in.”\n                                                                (Emphasis applied)\n\n       Thus, the heart of the matter is the second proviso appended to Section 32A(1)\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_135\">(b) of the IBC which provides statutory recognition of the criminal liability of the\npersons who are otherwise vicariously liable under <a href=\"/doc/686130/\" id=\"a_226\">Section 141</a> of NI Act, in the con-\ntext of <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_227\">Section 138</a> offence.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_136\">46.    Thus, Section 32A broadly leads to:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_112\">          a. Extinguishment of the criminal liability of the corporate debtor, if the\n             control of the corporate debtor goes in the hands of the new management\n             which is different from the original old management.\n          b.

Thus, I am of the view that by operation of the provisions of the IBC, the criminal\nprosecution initiated against the natural persons under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_231\">Section 138</a> read with 141 of the\n<a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_232\">NI Act</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/444619/\" id=\"a_233\">Section 200</a> of the CrPC would not stand terminated.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_140\">48.    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"162743580\" id=\"span_67\">In <a href=\"/doc/162743580/\" id=\"a_234\">JIK Industries Limited and Others v.

The binding effect contemplated\nby <a href=\"/doc/1343737/\" id=\"a_240\">Section 31</a> of the IBC is in respect of the assets and management of the corporate\ndebtor. No clause in the resolution plan even if accepted by the adjudicating\nauthority/appellate tribunal can take away the power and jurisdiction of the criminal court\nto conduct and dispose of the proceedings before it in accordance with the provisions of\nthe <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_241\">CrPC</a>.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_141\">49.

But,\nno provision of the IBC bars the continuation of the criminal prosecution initiated against\nthe directors and officials.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_142\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1318618\" id=\"span_69\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1318618\" id=\"span_70\">50.    It is equally true that once the corporate debtor comes under the resolution\nprocess, its erstwhile managing director(s) cannot continue to represent the company.\n<a href=\"/doc/1782573/\" id=\"a_243\">Section 305(2)</a> of the CrPC states that where a corporation is the accused person or one\nof the accused persons in an inquiry or trial, it may appoint a representative for the\npurpose of the inquiry or trial and such appointment need not be under the seal of the\ncorporation. Therefore, it is only the Resolution Professional who can represent the\naccused company during the pendency of the proceedings under IBC. After the\nproceedings are over, either the corporate entity may be dissolved or it can be taken over\nby a new management in which event the company will continue to exist. When a new\nmanagement takes over, it will have to make arrangements for representing the company.\nIf the company is dissolved as a result of the resolution process, obviously proceedings\nagainst it will have to be terminated. But even then, its erstwhile directors may not be\nable to take advantage of the situation. This is because, this Court in Aneeta\nHada (supra), even while overruling its decision in <a href=\"/doc/1318618/\" id=\"a_244\">Anil Hada v.

How can one allow the natural persons to escape\nliability on such specious plea? In such a situation the Latin maxim Lex Non Cogit Ad\nImpossibilia is attracted which means law does not compel a man to do which he cannot\npossibly perform. Broom&#x27;s &quot;Legal Maxims&quot; contains several illustrative cases in support\nof the maxim. This maxim has been referred to with approval by this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1250810/\" id=\"a_248\">State of\nRajasthan v.

As to the nature and extent of the liability, much\n        would depend on the terms of the guarantee itself. However, this Court has\n        indicated, time and again, that an involuntary act of the principal debtor\n        leading to loss of security, would not absolve a guarantor of its liability. In\n        Maharashtra SEB [Maharashtra SEB v. Official Liquidator, (1982) 3 SCC\n        358] the liability of the guarantor (in a case where liability of the principal\n        debtor was discharged under the Insolvency law or the Company law), was\n        considered.              It was held that in view of the unequivocal guarantee,\n        such liability of the guarantor continues and the creditor can realise the\n        same from the guarantor in view of the language of <a href=\"/doc/732670/\" id=\"a_280\">Section 128</a> of the Con-\n        tract Act, 1872 as there is no discharge under <a href=\"/doc/505928/\" id=\"a_281\">Section 134</a> of that Act. This\n        Court observed as follows: (SCC pp. 362-63, para 7)\n               “7. Under the bank guarantee in question the Bank has          undertaken\n           to pay the Electricity Board any sum up to Rs 50,000 and in order to re-\n           alise it all that the Electricity Board has to do is to make a demand.\n           Within forty-eight hours of such demand the Bank has to pay the amount\n           to the Electricity Board which is not under any obligation to prove any de-\n           fault on the part of the Company in liquidation before the amount de-\n           manded is paid. The Bank cannot raise the plea that it is liable only to the\n           extent of any loss that may have been sustained by the Electricity Board\n           owing to any default on the part of the supplier of goods i.e. the Com-\n           pany in liquidation. The liability is absolute and unconditional. The fact\n           that the Company in liquidation i.e. the principal debtor has gone into liq-\n           uidation also would not have any effect on the liability of the Bank i.e. the\n           guarantor. Under <a href=\"/doc/1377136/\" id=\"a_282\">Section 128</a> of the Contract Act, 1872, the liability of\n           the surety is coextensive         with that of the principal debtor unless it is\n           otherwise provided by the contract. A surety is no doubt discharged un-\n           der <a href=\"/doc/1029885/\" id=\"a_283\">Section 134</a> of the Contract Act, 1872 by any contract between the\n           creditor and the principal debtor by which the principal debtor is re-\n           leased or by any act or omission of the creditor, the legal consequence of\n           which is the discharge of the principal debtor. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1845651\" id=\"span_80\">But a discharge which the\n           principal debtor may secure by operation of law in bankruptcy (or in liqui-\n           dation proceedings in the case of a company) does not absolve the surety\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_81\">\f                                                                                              33</span>\n\n\n           of his liability (see <a href=\"/doc/1845651/\" id=\"a_284\">Jagannath Ganeshram Agarwale v.

This Court held that the defaulters cannot take benefit of their own action. The\ndisbursement of loan in an arbitrary manner and failure to recover was the very fulcrum\non the basis of which the winding up of the Society was ordered. I quote the relevant ob-\nservations as under:-</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_120\">        “21. It is apparent that on the termination of the liquidation proceedings,\n        liability of the members for the debts taken by them             does not come to\n        an end. There is no such provision in the Act providing once winding-up\n        period is over, the liability of the members for loans obtained by them\n        which is in their hands, and for which recovery proceedings are pending\n        shall come to an end. No automatic termination of recovery proceedings\n        against the members is contemplated. On the other hand, on completion of\n        the         period fixed to liquidate the Society, final report has to be submitted\n        as to the amount standing to the credit of the Society in liquidation after\n        paying off its liabilities including the share or interest of members. Thus,\n        even in the case of liquidation the accountability remains towards surplus\n        and liabilities do not come to an end. Even if the period fixed for liquidation\n        of Society is over, that does not terminate the proceedings for recovery\n        which have been initiated and appeals are pending.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_121\">               Xxx                          xxx                           xxx\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_83\">\f                                                                                          34</span>\n\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_122\">        24.

Thus, the members who have\n        obtained stay in appeal or on recovery proceedings or the case is pending,\n        cannot take advantage of the fact that the period fixed for the Liquidator\n        under the Act is over.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_161\">        25. Once a report has been submitted, the Registrar has to take         action\n        in terms of the report and in such circumstances when the proceedings for\n        recovery are pending against the members and the Society has taken loan\n        from the banks for its member, the actual money has to go to the creditor\n        i.e. to the bank who is going to be benefitted by recovery of public money in\n        the hands of members. In such cases it would be appropriate for the Regis-\n        trar to send notice      of the proceedings to a person who is to be benefit-\n        ted from the recovery. In the instant case, the Bank itself is a prime lender-\n        cum- liquidator. The proceedings cannot come to the end. Thus, in our con-\n        sidered opinion, it is open to the bank to continue with the recovery pro-\n        ceedings and make recoveries from the defaulting members. Merely on the\n        liquidation of the Society, or the factum      that the period fixed for liqui-\n        dation is over, liability of the members for the loans cannot be said to\n        have been wiped off.

The first proviso in sub-section (1) declares that if there is approval\n         of a resolution plan under <a href=\"/doc/1343737/\" id=\"a_351\">Section 31</a> and a prosecution has been instituted\n         during the CIRP against the corporate debtor, the corporate debtor will\n         stand discharged. This is, however, subject to the condition that the\n         requirements in sub-section (1), which have been elaborated by us, have\n         been fulfilled. In other words, if under the approved resolution plan, there is\n         a change in the management and control of the corporate debtor, to a\n         person, who is not a promoter, or in the management and control of the\n         corporate debtor, or a related party of the corporate debtor, or the person\n         who acquires control or management of the corporate debtor, has neither\n         abetted nor conspired in the commission of the offence, then, the\n         prosecution, if it is instituted after the commencement of the CIRP and\n         during its pendency, will stand discharged against the corporate debtor.\n         Under the second proviso to sub-section (1), however, the designated\n         partner in respect of the liability partnership or the officer in default, as\n         defined under <a href=\"/doc/84202242/\" id=\"a_352\">Section 2(60)</a> of the Companies Act, 2013, or every person,\n         who was, in any manner, in charge or responsible to the corporate debtor\n         for the conduct of its business, will continue to be liable to be prosecuted\n         and punished for the offence committed by the corporate debtor. This is\n         despite the extinguishment of the criminal liability of the corporate debtor\n         under sub-section (1). Still further, every person, who was associated with\n         the corporate debtor in any manner, and, who was directly or indirectly\n         involved in the commission of such offence, in terms of the report\n         submitted and report filed by the investigating authority, will continue to\n         be liable to be prosecuted and punished for the offence committed by the\n         corporate debtor.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_148\">         319. Thus, the combined reading of the various limbs of sub-section (1)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_104\">\f                                                                                        43</span>\n\n\n       would show that while, on the one hand, the corporate debtor is freed from\n       the liability for any offence committed before the commencement of the\n       CIRP, the statutory immunity from the consequences of the commission of\n       the offence by the corporate debtor is not available and the criminal\n       liability will continue to haunt the persons, who were in charge of the\n       assets of the corporate debtor, or who were responsible for the conduct of\n       its business or those who were associated with the corporate debtor in any\n       manner, and who were directly or indirectly involved in the commission\n       of the offence, and they will continue to be liable.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_149\">                   Xxx                   xxx                  xxx\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_150\">       326. We are of the clear view that no case whatsoever is made out to seek\n       invalidation of Section 32-A. The boundaries of this Court&#x27;s jurisdiction\n       are clear. The wisdom of the legislation is not open to judicial review.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_193\">       Having regard to the object of the Code, the experience of the working of\n       the Code, the interests of all stakeholders including most importantly the\n       imperative need to attract resolution applicants who would not shy away\n       from offering reasonable and fair value as part of the resolution plan if the\n       legislature thought that immunity be granted to the corporate debtor as\n       also its property, it hardly furnishes a ground for this Court to interfere.\n       The provision is carefully thought out. It is not as if the wrongdoers are\n       allowed to get away. They remain liable. The extinguishment of the\n       criminal liability of the corporate debtor is apparently important to the\n       new management to make a clean break with the past and start on a\n       clean slate. We must also not overlook the principle that the impugned\n       provision is part of an economic measure. The reverence courts justifiably\n       hold such laws in cannot but be applicable in the instant case as well. The\n       provision deals with reference to offences committed prior to the\n       commencement of the CIRP. With the admission of the application the\n       management of the corporate debtor passes into the hands of the interim\n       resolution professional and thereafter into the hands of the resolution\n       professional subject undoubtedly to the control by the Committee of\n       Creditors. As far as protection afforded to the property is concerned there is\n       clearly a rationale behind it. Having regard to the object of the statute we\n       hardly see any manifest arbitrariness in the provision.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_194\">       327…..Significantly every person who was associated with the corporate\n       debtor in any manner and who was directly or indirectly involved in the\n       commission of the offence in terms of the report submitted continues to\n       be liable to be prosecuted and punished for the offence committed by the\n       corporate debtor.”\n                                                               (Emphasis supplied)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_195\">83.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"196282971\" id=\"span_105\">In <a href=\"/doc/196282971/\" id=\"a_353\">P.

Section 32-A cannot possibly be said to throw any light on the true\ninterpretation of <a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_354\">Section 14(1)(a)</a> as the reason for introducing Section 32-\nA had nothing whatsoever to do with any moratorium provision. At the\nheart of the section is the extinguishment of criminal liability of the\ncorporate debtor, from the date the resolution plan has been approved by\nthe adjudicating authority, so that the new management may make a clean\nbreak with the past and start on a clean slate. A moratorium provision, on\nthe other hand, does not extinguish any liability, civil or criminal, but only\ncasts a shadow on proceedings already initiated and on proceedings to be\ninitiated, which shadow is lifted when the moratorium period comes to an\nend. Also, Section 32-A(1) operates only after the moratorium comes to\nan end. At the heart of Section 32-A is the IBC&#x27;s goal of value\nmaximisation and the need to obviate lower recoveries to creditors as a\nresult of the corporate debtor continuing to be exposed to criminal\nliability.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_152\">42. Unfortunately, Section 32-A is inelegantly drafted. The second proviso\nto Section 32-A(1) speaks of persons who are in any manner in charge of,\nor responsible to the corporate debtor for the conduct of its business or\nassociated with the corporate debtor and who are, directly or indirectly,\ninvolved in the commission of “such offence” i.e. the offence referred to in\nsub-section (1), “as per the report submitted or complaint filed by the\ninvestigating authority …”. The report submitted here refers to a police\nreport under <a href=\"/doc/1412034/\" id=\"a_355\">Section 173</a> CrPC, and complaints filed by investigating\nauthorities under special Acts, as opposed to private complaints. If the\nlanguage of the second proviso is taken to interpret the language of Section\n32-A(1) in that the “offence committed” under Section 32-A(1) would not\ninclude offences based upon complaints under <a href=\"/doc/255245/\" id=\"a_356\">Section 2(d)</a> CrPC, the width\nof the language would be cut down and the object of Section 32-A(1) would\nnot be achieved as all prosecutions emanating from private complaints\nwould be excluded. Obviously, Section 32-A(1) cannot be read in this\nfashion and clearly incudes the liability of the corporate debtor for all\noffences committed prior to the commencement of the corporate\ninsolvency resolution process. Doubtless, a <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_357\">Section 138</a> proceeding would\nbe included, and would, after the moratorium period comes to an end\nwith a resolution plan by a new management being approved by the\nadjudicating authority, cease to be an offence qua the corporate debtor.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_196\">43….the expression “prosecution” in the first proviso of Section 32-A(1)\nrefers to criminal proceedings properly so-called either through the\nmedium of a first information report or complaint filed by an investigating\nauthority or complaint and not to quasi-criminal proceedings that are\ninstituted under Sections 138/141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act against\nthe corporate debtor, the object of Section 14(1) IBC gets subserved, as\ndoes the object of Section 32-A, which does away with criminal\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_107\">\f                                                                                        45</span>\n\n\n       prosecutions in all cases against the corporate debtor, thus absolving the\n       corporate debtor from the same after a new management comes in.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_197\">             Xxx                 xxx                 xxx\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_198\">       45. <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_358\">Section 138</a> contains within it the ingredients of the offence made out.\n       The deeming provision is important in that the legislature is cognizant of\n       the fact that what is otherwise a civil liability is now also deemed to be an\n       offence, since this liability is made punishable by law. It is important to\n       note that the transaction spoken of is a commercial transaction between\n       two parties which involves payment of money for a debt or liability. The\n       Explanation to <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_359\">Section 138</a> makes it clear that such debt or other liability\n       means a legally enforceable debt or other liability. Thus, a debt or other\n       liability barred by the law of limitation would be outside the scope of\n       <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_360\">Section 138</a>. This, coupled with fine that may extend to twice the amount of\n       the cheque that is payable as compensation to the aggrieved party to cover\n       both the amount of the cheque and the interest and costs thereupon, would\n       show that it is really a hybrid provision to enforce payment under a\n       bounced cheque if it is otherwise enforceable in civil law. Further, though\n       the ingredients of the offence are contained in the first part of <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_361\">Section 138</a>\n       when the cheque is returned by the bank unpaid for the reasons given in the\n       section, the proviso gives an opportunity to the drawer of the cheque,\n       stating that the drawer must fail to make payment of the amount within 15\n       days of the receipt of a notice, again making it clear that the real object of\n       the provision is not to penalise the wrongdoer for an offence that is already\n       made out, but to compensate the victim.”\n                                                                (Emphasis supplied)\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_199\">84.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"86481476\" id=\"span_108\">In <a href=\"/doc/86481476/\" id=\"a_362\">Narinder Garg and Others v.
