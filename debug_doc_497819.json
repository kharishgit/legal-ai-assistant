The failure of the prosecution to show that\t the\nassembly was unlawful must necessarily result in the failure\nof the charge under <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_34\">section 149</a> )PC.

[93D]\n4.   The  conviction  of appellants 2 to 4  for\t an  offence\nunder  <a href=\"/doc/1540253/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 326</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_40\">149</a> IPC cannot be sustained and the\tsame\nwould  be the position with regard to the conviction of\t all\nthe  appellants for other offences with the aid\t of  <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_41\">Section\n149</a> IPC also. [93B]\n5.   The  High Court failed to draw the distinction  between\nan  offence under clause (b) and (c) of <a href=\"/doc/305371/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 299</a> IPC\t and\nthe one failing under clause (3) of <a href=\"/doc/626019/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 300</a> IPC. [93G]\n6, The effect of the acquittal of the two accused persons by\nthe High Court and without the High Court finding that\tsome\nother  known  or unknown persons were also involved  in\t the\nassault,  would be that for all intent and purposes the\t two\nacquitted  accused persons were not members of the  unlawful\nassembly.   Thus,  only four accused could be said  to\thave\nbeen the members of the assembly but such an assembly  which\ncomprises  of  less  than five members is  not\tan  unlawful\nassembly within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/1542085/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 141</a> IPC. [92G]\n7.   Appellant No. 1 Subran not having been charged for\t the\nsubstantive  offence of murder under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 302</a>  IPC,\teven\nthe  trial court, which tried the six accused  persons,\t was\nnot justified in recording a conviction against him for\t the\nsubstantive offence of murder punishable under Sec-\n87\ntion  302  <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_46\">IPC</a> after framing a charge against  him  for\t the\noffence\t under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 302</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_48\">Section 149</a>  IPC  only.\n[93C]\n8.   Appellant No. 1, Subran, was never called upon to\tmeet\na  charge under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_49\">Section 302</a> IPC simplicitor and,  therefore,\nin defending himself, he can not be said to have been called\nupon  to  meet\tthat  charge and he  could  very  well\thave\nconsidered it unnecessary to concentrate on that part of the\nprosecution   case  during  the\t cross-examination  of\t the\nprosecution  witnesses.\t  Therefore, the conviction  of\t the\nappellant  No.\t1 for an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_50\">Section 302</a>  was\t not\npermissible. [93E]\n9.   The  intention to cause murder of Suku deceased,  could\nnot  be\t attributed  to\t appellant No.\t1  and\tthe  medical\nevidence also shows that the injuries attributed to him were\nnot sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the\ndeath  of the deceased.\t The conviction of appellant  No.  1\nfor  the  substantive  offence\tunder  <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_51\">Section\t302</a>  IPC  is\ntherefore  unwarranted and cannot be sustained.\t  That\tSuku\ndeceased  died as a result of injuries inflicted on  him  by\nall  the four appellants is not a matter which is in  doubt.\nFrom the ocular evidence read with the medical evidence,  it\nstands\testablished  that the injuries on the  deceased\t had\nbeen caused by all the four appellants and that the death of\nSuku  had occurred due to the receipt of multiple  injuries.\n[93H, 94A-B]\n10.  On\t a consideration of the circumstances of  the  case,\nthe  type of weapons with which the accused were  armed\t and\nthe  nature and seat of the injuries, it is not possible  to\nhold  that  all the four appellants had\t shared\t the  common\nintention of causing such bodily injuries on the deceased as\nwere likely to cause the death of Suku or were sufficient in\nthe  ordinary  course  of nature to cause  his\tdeath.\t The\nappellants  would,  therefore  be  liable  for\tthe  offence\ncommitted individually by each one of them. [94D-E]\n11.  The  case\tof appellant No. 1 therefore,  falls  within\nSection\t 299 I PC punishable under <a href=\"/doc/409589/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 304</a>\tPart-1\t[PC.\nHe  is\taccordingly,  convicted for  the  said\toffence\t and\nsentenced  to suffer rigorous imprisonment for a  period  of\nseven years and to pay a fine of Rs. 2,000 and in default of\npayment\t suffer further rigorous imprisonment for one  year.\nFine  if realised to be paid to the heirs of  the  deceased.\n[94G-H]\n12  (a)\t With  regard to the three  other  appellants  their\nconviction for\n88\nan offence under <a href=\"/doc/1540253/\" id=\"a_53\">Section 326</a> with the aid of <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_54\">Section 149</a>  is\nnot sustainable in law, it is accordingly set aside and they\nare  convicted\tunder <a href=\"/doc/1540253/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 326</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_56\">149</a> IPC.   They  would  be\nresponsible for their individual acts.\tThe injuries  caused\nby  appellants\t2 and 3 were with a torch, iron\t rod  and  a\ncycle chain.  None of the injuries caused by them  according\nto  the\t post-mortem report were on any vital  part  of\t the\nbody,  though some of the injuries caused by  blunt  weapons\nwere grievous in nature.  Each of them are convicted for  an\noffence\t under\t<a href=\"/doc/1133601/\" id=\"a_57\">Section\t 325</a> IPC  and  sentenced  to  suffer\nrigorous imprisonment for two years each. [95B-C]\n12  (b)\t Appellant  No. 4 caused grievous  injuries  to\t the\ndeceased  with\ta knife, the offence would  therefore,\tfall\nunder  <a href=\"/doc/1540253/\" id=\"a_58\">Section 326</a> IPC.\t He is therefore convicted  for\t the\nsaid  offence and sentenced to suffer rigorous\timprisonment\nfor  a period of three years and to pay a fine of Rs.  500/-\nand  in default of payment to suffer  rigorous\timprisonment\nfor  a period of three months.\tThe fine, if realised  shall\nbe paid to the heirs of the deceased.\n[95D]\n12 (c) The conviction of all the appellants for the  offence\nunder <a href=\"/doc/724142/\" id=\"a_59\">Section 324</a> as recorded by the High Court as also\t for\nthe  other  offences are maintained but without the  aid  of\n<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_60\">Section 149</a> IPC.

They were put on trial and the prosecution sought  to\nestablish its case by examining as many as six eye-witnesses\nbesides other evidence, documentary and oral.  At the  trial\nhowever, four eye- witnesses, PW3 Devassykutty, PWs 6 and  7\nsalesman and his assistant in the arrack shop and PW8 Unni @\nVelayudhan   turned   hostile  and  did\t not   support\t the\nprosecution  case.   The prosecution case was sought  to  be\nproved\tby  the ocular testimony of PW4 Biju and  PW5  Anil,\nboth  aged about 13 years at the time of occurrence and\t the\nother  evidence.

The Doctor has opined\nthat the deceased had died due to multiple injuries and that\nthe  injuries  could have been caused by  beating  him\twith\ntorches,  knife,  iron\trod, cycle chain  and  the  chopper.\nAccording to him, the cumulative effect of all the injuries,\ntaken  together, had resulted in the death of the  deceased.\nThe  doctor further stated that as a result of the  chemical\nanalysis  of  the  viscera,  blood  and\t urine,\t there\t was\nindication that the deceased had consumed alcohol before  he\nhad been assaulted, though he was unable to give the quality\nor quantity of liquor consumed by the deceased.\nFrom  an analysis of the record of injuries as\tdetailed  in\nthe  post-mortem  report, it transpires that there  were  18\ncontusions  of\tdifferent  dimensions  but  minor  in  their\ngravity on the body of the deceased.  Eight of the  injuries\nrecorded,  out\tof the 38 in the post mortem  report.,\twere\nabrasions on different parts of the body.  According to\t the\nmedical witness, nine out\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">91</span>\nof  those injuries could have been caused by a fall  or\t the\ndeceased coming into contact with any rough surface or area.\nOut of the remaining injuries, seven were chop wounds  while\ntwo  were stab wounds, besides three were incised  injuries.\nit was the cumulative effect of the injuries which  resulted\nin  the death of the deceased and according to\tthe  doctor,\nthe  injuries when taken together were sufficient  to  cause\ndeath  in  the\tordinary  course of  nature.   None  of\t the\ninjuries  by  itself  was  found to  be\t sufficient  in\t the\nordinary  course of nature to cause death of  the  deceased.\nAccording  to the medical opinion about the cause of  death,\n&quot;deceased died due to multiple injuries&quot;.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">From the above analysis of injuries, it cannot be said\tthat\nany one of the four appellants, who alone stand convicted by\nthe  High  Court had inflicted injuries intending  to  cause\ndeath or such bodily injury as is sufficient in the ordinary\ncourse\tof nature to cause death.  As already  noticed,\t six\naccused persons had been charged by the investigating agency\nfor  offences punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1096965/\" id=\"a_78\">Sections 143</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1258372/\" id=\"a_79\">147</a>, <a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_80\">148</a>,\t<a href=\"/doc/1599401/\" id=\"a_81\">341</a>,\n<a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_82\">323</a>,  <a href=\"/doc/724142/\" id=\"a_83\">324</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1540253/\" id=\"a_84\">326</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_85\">302</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_86\">Section 149</a> IPC and put  on\ntrial.\t The  trial  court convicted accused 2\tto  6  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1540253/\" id=\"a_87\">Section\t 326</a>  IPC  with\t the aid of  <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_88\">Section  149</a>  IPC.\t  It\nconvicted  accused  No. 1 for an offence under\t<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_89\">Section\t 302</a>\nIPC.  While convicting accused 2 to 6 for the offence  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1540253/\" id=\"a_90\">Section 326</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_91\">149</a> IPC, the trial court came to the  conclusion\nthat &#x27;the accused did not share the common object to  murder\nSuku  and that the common object was only to cause  grievous\nhurt&#x27;  to the deceased.\t Being of the opinion, that  accused\nNo. 1 had caused injuries with a chopper and those  injuries\n&quot;could&quot;\t have resulted in the death of the deceased, he\t was\nconvicted  for an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_92\">Section 302</a> IPC.   The\tHigh\nCourt  acquitted  two  of  the\taccused\t and  convicted\t the\nremaining  four\t only.\t The High  Court  found\t that  clear\nevidence of the eye-witnesses was only against accused\tNos.\n2, 3 and 5 besides appellant No. 1. The participation of the\n6th accused and the role assigned to him by the\t prosecution\nwas  doubted by the learned Judges of the High Court and  he\nwas  given the benefit of doubt and  acquitted.\t  Similarly,\nthe High Court disbelieved the role assigned to accused\t No.\n4  and\tdoubted his participation in the commission  of\t the\ncrime.\t He  was  also&#x27;\t given\tthe  benefit  of  doubt\t and\nacquitted.  While setting aside the conviction and  sentence\nof  the said two accused, the High Court did not  hold\tthat\nbeside\tthe  four accused convicted by it, there  were\tsome\nother known or unknown accused who had also been a party  to\nthe commission of the crime.  It is in this above background\nthat we have to consider the nature\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">92</span>\nof the offence committed by the four appellants.\nAdmittedly,  none  of the accused persons  individually\t had\nbeen  charged  for the substantive offence of  murder  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_93\">Section\t 302</a>  IPC.  In the trial court all the\tsix  accused\nwere  charge sheeted for an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_94\">Section  302</a>\tread\nwith  <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_95\">Section  149</a>  IPC.  Other\t charges  were\talso  framed\nagainst\t the  accused but only with the aid of\t<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_96\">Section\t 149</a>\nIPC.  After the acquittal of the two accused, could the High\nCourt  convict appellant No. 1 for the\tsubstantive  offence\nunder  <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_97\">Section 302</a> IPC (with which he had not been  charged)\nand  the  appellants  2 to 4 for an  offence  under  <a href=\"/doc/1540253/\" id=\"a_98\">Section\n326</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_99\">149</a> IPC ?\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_11\"><a href=\"/doc/1542085/\" id=\"a_100\">Section\t 141</a>  IPC  defines an unlawful\tassembly  to  be  an\nassembly of five or more persons, where the common object of\nthe persons comprising that assembly is to commit any of the\nacts  enumerated  in  the  five\t clauses  of  that  Section.\n<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_101\">Section 149</a> IPC reads as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">\t      &quot;<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_102\">Sec. 149</a>.

The effect of\t the\nacquittal  of the two accused persons by the High Court\t and\nwithout\t the  High Court finding that some  other  known  or\nunknown persons were also involved in the assault, would  be\nthat  for all intent and purposes the two acquitted  accused\npersons\t were not members of the unlawful  assembly.   Thus,\nonly four accused could be said to have been the members  of\nthe  assembly but such an assembly which comprises  of\tless\nthan  five  members is not an unlawful assembly\t within\t the\nmeaning\t of <a href=\"/doc/1542085/\" id=\"a_107\">Section 141</a> IPC.  The existence of\tan  unlawful\nassembly  is a necessary postulate for invoking <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_108\">Section\t 149</a>\nIPC.   Where the existence of such an unlawful\tassembly  is\nnot\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">93</span>\nproved,\t the  conviction  with the aid of  <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_109\">Section  149</a>\t IPC\ncannot\tbe  recorded  or  sustained.   The  failure  of\t the\nprosecution  to\t show that the assembly\t was  unlawful\tmust\nnecessarily  result  in\t the failure  of  the  charge  under\n<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_110\">Section 149</a> IPC.  Consequently, the conviction of appellants\n2  to 4 for an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1540253/\" id=\"a_111\">Section 326</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_112\">149</a> IPC  cannot  be\nsustained and the same would be the position with regard  to\nthe conviction of all the appellants for other offences with\nthe aid of <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_113\">Section 149</a> IPC also.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_13\">Since,\tappellant No. 1 Subran had not been charged for\t the\nsubstantive  offence of murder under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_114\">Section 302</a>  IPC,\teven\nthe  trial court, which tried the six accused  persons,\t was\nnot justified in recording a conviction against him for\t the\nsubstantive  offence of murder punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_115\">Section\t 302</a>\nIPC after framing a charge against him for the offence under\n<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_116\">Section\t 302</a>  read  with <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_117\">Section 149</a>  IPC  only.   A  person\ncharged\t for  an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_118\">Section 302</a>,  IPC  read\twith\n<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_119\">Section\t 149</a> cannot be convicted of the substantive  offence\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_120\">Section 302</a>, IPC without a specific charge having been\nframed against him as envisaged by law.\t Conviction for\t the\nsubstantive:  offence in such a case is unjustified  because\nan accused might be misled in his defence by the absence  of\nthe  charge  for the substantive offence under\t<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_121\">Section\t 302</a>\nIPC.  Appellant No. 1, Subran, was never called upon to meet\na  charge under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_122\">Section 302</a> IPC simplicitor and,  therefore,\nin defending himself, he can not be said to have been called\nupon  to  meet\tthat  charge and he  could  very  well\thave\nconsidered it unnecessary to concentrate on that part of the\nprosecution   case  during  the\t cross-examination  of\t the\nprosecution  witnesses.\t  Therefore, the conviction  of\t the\nfirst  appellant  for an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_123\">Section 302</a>  was\t not\npermissible.  That apart, according to the medical evidence,\nnone of the injuries allegedly caused by this appellant\t was\neither\tindividually  or taken collectively with  the  other\ninjuries caused by him, sufficient in the ordinary course of\nnature to cause death of Suku.\tMedical evidence is clear on\nthis  aspect of the case and it is not possible to say\tthat\nthe  injuries  inflicted  by the first\tappellant  with\t the\nchopper were inflicted with the intention to cause the death\nof  Suku.   The High Court failed to  draw  the\t distinction\nbetween an offence under clause (b)  and (c) of <a href=\"/doc/305371/\" id=\"a_124\">Section\t 299</a>\nIPC  and  the one falling under clause (3) of&#x27;\t<a href=\"/doc/626019/\" id=\"a_125\">Section\t 300</a>\nIPC.  The intention to cause murder of Suku deceased,  could\nnot be attributed to him and the medical evidence also shows\nthat  the injuries attributed to him were not sufficient  in\nthe  ordinary  course  of  nature  to  cause  death  of\t the\ndeceased.   The conviction of appellant No. 1,\tSubran,\t for\nthe substantive offence under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_126\">Section 302</a> IPC is therefore,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">94</span>\nunwarranted  and  cannot be sustained.\tThat  Suku  deceased\ndied  as  a result of injuries inflicted on him by  all\t the\nfour appellants is not a matter which is in doubt.  From the\nocular\tevidence read with the medical evidence,  it  stands\nestablished  that  the\tinjuries on the\t deceased  had\tbeen\ncaused by all the four appellants and that the death of Suku\nhad  occurred  due to receipt of  multiple  injuries.\tWhat\noffence can then be said to have been committed by the\tfour\nappellants ?\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_14\">According to the medical evidence, the injuries caused\twere\ncumulatively  sufficient  to cause death and the  death\t had\noccurred   due\tto  multiple  injuries\twhich\twere   found\nsufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause  death.\nAccording to the ocular testimony of witnesses namely,\tBiju\n(PW4)  and  Anil (PW5), who have been believed by  both\t the\ncourts\tbelow  and with which finding we have no  reason  to\ndiffer,\t all the four appellants had caused those  injuries.\nIt is, therefore, necessary in a case like this to determine\nas  to\twhich  of  the accused is  guilty  of  a  particular\noffence.   On  a consideration of the circumstances  of\t the\ncase,  the  type of weapons with which they were  armed\t and\nnature and seat of the injuries, it is not possible to\thold\nthat all the four appellants had shared the common intention\nof  causing  such bodily injuries on the  deceased  as\twere\nlikely to cause the death of Suku or were sufficient in\t the\nordinary   course  of  nature  to  cause  his  death.\t The\nappellants  would, therefore be liable for the offence\tcom-\nmitted individually by each one of them.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_15\">As  already  noticed,  though  it may  not  be\tpossible  to\nattribute   to\tappellant  No.\t1,  Subran,  the   necessary\nintention to cause death of Suku so as to hold him guilty of\nan  offence  of\t murder\t under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_127\">Section\t302</a>  IPC  since\t the\ninjuries inflicted by him were not found to be sufficient in\nthe  ordinary course of nature to cause death of  Suku,\t but\nlooking to the weapon with which he was armed and the nature\nnumber\tand seat of injuries inflicted by him though not  on\nany  vital  part, he can certainly be  attributed  with\t the\nknowledge that with those injuries it was likely that  death\nof  Suku  may be caused and, therefore, he can\tbe  cloathed\nwith   the  liability  of  causing  culpable  homicide\t not\namounting  to  murder.\t The case of  the  first  appellant,\ntherefore,  falls  within <a href=\"/doc/305371/\" id=\"a_128\">Section 299</a> IPC  punishable  under\n<a href=\"/doc/409589/\" id=\"a_129\">Section\t 304</a> Part-1 <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_130\">IPC</a>.
