The facts lie in a narrow compass.  On the basis of a  report  by  the\ninformant under <a href=\"/doc/1980578/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 154</a> CrPC, FIR  No.  205/2014  dated  26.07.2014  was\nregistered at Chandrayanagutta Police Station, Hyderabad  for  the  offences\npunishable under <a href=\"/doc/1258372/\" id=\"a_4\">Sections 147</a>, <a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_5\">148</a> <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_6\">149</a> and <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_7\">307</a>  of  the  Indian  Penal  Code\n(<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_8\">IPC</a>).  Challenging the initiation of criminal  action,  the  three  accused\npersons, namely, accused Nos. 1, 2 and  5,  (respondent  Nos.  1,  2  and  3\nherein)  invoked  inherent  jurisdiction  of  the  High  Court  in  Criminal\nPetition No. 10012 of  2014  for  quashing  of  the  FIR  and  consequential\ninvestigation. As the impugned order would show, the  learned  single  Judge\nreferred to the FIR and took note of the submissions of the learned  counsel\nfor the petitioners therein that all the allegations that  had  been  raised\nin the FIR were false and they had been falsely  implicated  and  thereafter\nexpressed his disinclination to interfere on the  ground  that  it  was  not\nappropriate to stay the investigation of the case. However, as a  submission\nhad been raised that the accused persons were innocent and  there  had  been\nallegation of false implication, it  would  be  appropriate  to  direct  the\npolice  not  to  arrest  the  petitioners  during  the   pendency   of   the\ninvestigation and, accordingly, it was so directed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_4\">3.    It is  submitted  by  Mr.  Harin  P.  Raval,  learned  senior  counsel\nappearing for the State that the informant had sustained  grievous  injuries\nand was attacked by dangerous weapons and  custodial  interrogation  of  the\naccused persons is absolutely essential. According to him,  the  High  Court\nin exercise of inherent power under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 482</a> CrPC can  quash  an  FIR  on\ncertain well known parameters but while declining  to  quash  the  same,  it\ncannot extend the privilege to the accused persons which is  in  the  nature\nof an anticipatory bail.  Learned  senior  counsel  would  submit  that  the\nnature of the order passed by the High Court is absolutely  unknown  to  the\nexercise of inherent jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 482</a> CrPC and, therefore,  it\ndeserves to be axed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_5\">4.    Ms. Nilofar Khan, learned counsel appearing for the respondent Nos.  1\nto 3 in support of the order passed by the High  Court  submitted  that  the\ncustodial interrogation is not necessary in  the  facts  of  the  case.  She\nwould further submit that the plentitude of  power  conferred  on  the  High\nCourt under\n<a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 482</a> CrPC empowers it to pass  such  an  order  and  there  being  no\ninfirmity in the order, no interference is warranted  by this Court.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_6\">5.    The controversy compels one to visit the earlier decisions.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1708066\" id=\"span_1\">In   <a href=\"/doc/1708066/\" id=\"a_12\">King\nEmperor v. Khwaja Nazir Ahmad</a>[1] while deliberating on the  scope  of  right\nconferred on the police under <a href=\"/doc/1980578/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 154</a> CrPC, Privy Council observed:-</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">“… so it  is  of  the  utmost  importance  that  the  judiciary  should  not\ninterfere with the police in matters which are  within  their  province  and\ninto which the law imposes upon them the duty of enquiry. In India,  as  has\nbeen shown, there is a  statutory  right  on  the  part  of  the  police  to\ninvestigate  the  circumstances  of  an  alleged  cognizable  crime  without\nrequiring any authority from the judicial  authorities,  and  it  would,  as\ntheir Lordships think, be  an  unfortunate  result  if  it  should  be  held\npossible to interfere with those statutory rights  by  an  exercise  of  the\ninherent jurisdiction of the Court. The functions of the judiciary  and  the\npolice  are  complementary,  not  overlapping,  and   the   combination   of\nindividual liberty with a due observance of law and  order  is  only  to  be\nobtained by leaving each to exercise its  own  function,  always  of  course\nsubject to the right of the Court to intervene in an appropriate  case  when\nmoved under <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 491</a> of the Criminal Procedure Code  to  give  directions\nin the nature of habeas corpus. In such a case as the present, however,  the\nCourt&#x27;s functions begin when a charge is preferred before it and  not  until\nthen.”\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_7\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"10239019\" id=\"span_2\">6.    Having stated  what  lies  within  the  domain  of  the  investigating\nagency, it is essential to refer  to  the  Constitution  Bench  decision  in\n<a href=\"/doc/10239019/\" id=\"a_15\">Lalita Kumari v. Government of Uttar Pradesh and Ors</a>[2]. The  question  that\narose for consideration before the Constitution Bench was whether “a  police\nofficer is bound to register a first information report upon  receiving  any\ninformation relating to commission of a  cognizable  offence  under  <a href=\"/doc/1980578/\" id=\"a_16\">Section\n154</a> CrPC or the police officer has  the  power  to  conduct  a  ‘preliminary\ninquiry’  in  order  to  test  the  veracity  of  such  information   before\nregistering the same”?  While  interpreting  <a href=\"/doc/1980578/\" id=\"a_17\">Section  154</a>  CrPC,  the  Court\naddressing itself to various facets opined that <a href=\"/doc/378667/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 154(1)</a>  CrPC  admits\nof no  other  construction  but  the  literal  construction.</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1033637\" id=\"span_3\">Thereafter  it\nreferred to the legislative intent of <a href=\"/doc/1980578/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 154</a> which has been  elaborated\nin <a href=\"/doc/1033637/\" id=\"a_20\">State of Haryana and Ors. v. Bhajan Lal and  Ors.</a>[3]  and  various  other\nauthorities.  Eventually the larger  Bench  opined  that  reasonableness  or\ncredibility of  the  information  is  not  a  condition  precedent  for  the\nregistration of a case. Thereafter there was advertence to  the  concept  of\npreliminary inquiry. In that context, the Court opined thus:-</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">“103. It means that the number  of  FIRs  not  registered  is  approximately\nequivalent to the number of FIRs actually registered. Keeping  in  view  the\nNCRB  figures  that  show  that  about  60  lakh  cognizable  offences  were\nregistered in India during the year 2012, the burking of  crime  may  itself\nbe in the range of about 60 lakhs every year. Thus, it is seen that  such  a\nlarge number of FIRs are  not  registered  every  year,  which  is  a  clear\nviolation of the rights of the victims of such a large number of crimes.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">104. Burking of crime leads to dilution of the rule  of  law  in  the  short\nrun; and also has a very negative impact on the rule of law in the long  run\nsince  people  stop  having  respect  for  the  rule  of  law.  Thus,   non-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_8\">registration of such a large number of FIRs leads to a definite  lawlessness\nin the society.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_9\">105. Therefore, reading <a href=\"/doc/1980578/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 154</a> in any other  form  would  not  only  be\ndetrimental to the scheme of the Code but also to the society  as  a  whole.\nIt is thus seen that this Court  has  repeatedly  held  in  various  decided\ncases that registration of FIR is mandatory if the information given to  the\npolice under  <a href=\"/doc/1980578/\" id=\"a_22\">Section  154</a>  of  the  Code  discloses  the  commission  of  a\ncognizable offence.”\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">7.    While dealing with the likelihood of  misuse  of  the  provision,  the\nCourt ruled thus:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">“114. It is true that a delicate balance has to be  maintained  between  the\ninterest of the society and protecting the  liberty  of  an  individual.  As\nalready discussed above, there are already  sufficient  safeguards  provided\nin the Code which duly protect the liberty  of  an  individual  in  case  of\nregistration of false FIR.  At  the  same  time,  <a href=\"/doc/1980578/\" id=\"a_23\">Section  154</a>  was  drafted\nkeeping in mind the interest of the victim and the  society.  Therefore,  we\nare of the cogent view that mandatory registration  of  FIRs  under  <a href=\"/doc/1980578/\" id=\"a_24\">Section\n154</a> of the  Code  will  not  be  in  contravention  of  <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_25\">Article  21</a>  of  the\nConstitution as purported by various counsel.”\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"871062\" id=\"span_4\">8.    The exceptions that were carved  out  pertain  to  medical  negligence\ncases as has been stated in <a href=\"/doc/871062/\" id=\"a_26\">Jacob Mathew v. State of Punjab</a>[4].</span>   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1038846\" id=\"span_5\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1147392\" id=\"span_6\">The  Court\nalso referred to the authorities in              <a href=\"/doc/1147392/\" id=\"a_27\">P. Sirajuddin v.  State  of\nMadras</a>[5] and <a href=\"/doc/1038846/\" id=\"a_28\">CBI v. Tapan Kumar Singh</a>[6] and  finally  held  that  what  is\nnecessary is only that the information given to  the  police  must  disclose\nthe commission of a cognizable offence. In such  a  situation,  registration\nof an FIR is mandatory. However, if no cognizable offence  is  made  out  in\nthe information given, then the FIR need not be registered  immediately  and\nperhaps the police  can  conduct  a  sort  of  preliminary  verification  or\ninquiry for the limited purpose of ascertaining as to whether  a  cognizable\noffence has been committed. But, if the information given  clearly  mentions\nthe commission of a cognizable offence, there is  no  other  option  but  to\nregister an FIR forthwith. Other considerations  are  not  relevant  at  the\nstage of registration of FIR, such as, whether the  information  is  falsely\ngiven, whether the  information  is  genuine,  whether  the  information  is\ncredible, etc.  At the stage of registration of FIR, what is to be  seen  is\nmerely whether the information given ex facie discloses the commission of  a\ncognizable offence.</span></span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">9.    Be it noted,  certain  directions  were  issued  by  the  Constitution\nBench, which we think, are apt to be extracted:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">“120.5. The scope of preliminary inquiry is not to verify  the  veracity  or\notherwise of the information received but  only  to  ascertain  whether  the\ninformation reveals any cognizable offence.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">120.6. As to what type and in which  cases  preliminary  inquiry  is  to  be\nconducted will depend on the facts  and  circumstances  of  each  case.

While ensuring and protecting the  rights  of  the  accused  and  the\ncomplainant, a preliminary inquiry should be  made  time-bound  and  in  any\ncase it should not exceed 7 days. The fact of such delay and the  causes  of\nit must be reflected in the General Diary entry.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">120.8. Since the General Diary/Station Diary/Daily Diary is  the  record  of\nall  information  received  in  a  police  station,  we  direct   that   all\ninformation  relating  to  cognizable   offences,   whether   resulting   in\nregistration of FIR or leading  to  an  inquiry,  must  be  mandatorily  and\nmeticulously reflected in the said diary  and  the  decision  to  conduct  a\npreliminary inquiry must also be reflected, as mentioned above.”\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">10.   We have copiously referred to the aforesaid  decision  for  the  simon\npure reason that at the instance of the informant the FIR was lodged and  it\nwas registered which is in accord with  the  decision  of  the  Constitution\nBench.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">11.

The  Court  also  observed\nthat it may not be possible to lay down any  precise,  clearly  defined  and\nsufficiently channelized and inflexible guidelines or rigid formulae and  to\ngive an exhaustive list  of  myriad  cases  wherein  such  power  should  be\nexercised.  The illustrations given by the Court need to be  recapitulated:-</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">“(1) Where the allegations made in  the  first  information  report  or  the\ncomplaint, even if they are taken at their face value and accepted in  their\nentirety do not prima facie constitute  any  offence  or  make  out  a  case\nagainst the accused.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">(2) Where  the  allegations  in  the  first  information  report  and  other\nmaterials, if any,  accompanying  the  FIR  do  not  disclose  a  cognizable\noffence, justifying  an  investigation  by  police  officers  under  <a href=\"/doc/51689/\" id=\"a_43\">Section\n156(1)</a> of the Code except under an order of a Magistrate within the  purview\nof <a href=\"/doc/1518148/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 155(2)</a> of the Code.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">(3) Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the FIR  or  complaint  and\nthe  evidence  collected  in  support  of  the  same  do  not  disclose  the\ncommission of any offence and make out a case against the accused.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">(4) Where, the allegations  in  the  FIR  do  not  constitute  a  cognizable\noffence but constitute only a non-cognizable offence,  no  investigation  is\npermitted  by  a  police  officer  without  an  order  of  a  Magistrate  as\ncontemplated under <a href=\"/doc/1518148/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 155(2)</a> of the Code.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">(5) Where the allegations made in the FIR or complaint  are  so  absurd  and\ninherently improbable on the basis of  which  no  prudent  person  can  ever\nreach a just conclusion that  there  is  sufficient  ground  for  proceeding\nagainst the accused.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">(6) Where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of  the  provisions\nof the Code or the concerned Act  (under  which  a  criminal  proceeding  is\ninstituted) to the institution and continuance  of  the  proceedings  and/or\nwhere there is a specific provision  in  the  Code  or  the  concerned  Act,\nproviding efficacious redress for the grievance of the aggrieved party.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">(7) Where a criminal  proceeding  is  manifestly  attended  with  mala  fide\nand/or where the proceeding  is  maliciously  instituted  with  an  ulterior\nmotive for wreaking vengeance on the accused and with a view  to  spite  him\ndue to private and personal grudge.”\n\n\n      It is worthy to note that  the  Court  has  clarified  that  the  said\nparameters  or  guidelines  are  not  exhaustive  but   only   illustrative.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_18\">Nevertheless, it throws light on  the  circumstances  and  situations  where\ncourt’s inherent power can be exercised.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_19\">12.   There can be no dispute over the proposition that inherent power in  a\nmatter of quashment of FIR has to be exercised sparingly  and  with  caution\nand when and only when such exercise is justified by the  test  specifically\n<a href=\"/doc/1871696/\" id=\"a_46\">laid down in</a> the provision itself. There is no denial of the fact  that  the\npower under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 482</a> CrPC is very wide but it needs no  special  emphasis\nto state that conferment of  wide  power  requires  the  court  to  be  more\ncautious. It casts an onerous and more diligent duty on the Court.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">13.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"513644\" id=\"span_17\">In this regard, it  would  be  seemly  to  reproduce  a  passage  from\n<a href=\"/doc/513644/\" id=\"a_48\">Kurukshetra University</a> (supra) wherein  Chandrachud,  J.  (as  His  Lordship\nthen was) opined thus:-</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">“2.

The  police  had  not\neven commenced investigation into the complaint filed by the Warden  of  the\nUniversity and no proceeding at all was pending in any  court  in  pursuance\nof the FIR. It ought to be realised that inherent powers do  not  confer  an\narbitrary jurisdiction on the  High  Court  to  act  according  to  whim  or\ncaprice.  That  statutory  power  has  to  be  exercised   sparingly,   with\ncircumspection and in the rarest of rare cases.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">14.   We have referred to the said decisions only to stress upon the  issue,\nhow the exercise of jurisdiction by the High Court in a proceeding  relating\nto quashment of FIR can be  justified.   We  repeat  even  at  the  cost  of\nrepetition that the said power has to be exercised in a very sparing  manner\nand is not  to  be  used  to  choke  or  smother  the  prosecution  that  is\nlegitimate.  The surprise that was expressed  almost  four  decades  ago  in\nKurukshetra University’s case  compels  us  to  observe  that  we  are  also\nsurprised by the impugned order.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">15.   In the instant case, the High Court has not  referred  to  allegations\nmade in the FIR or what has come out in the  investigation.

We have referred to the aforesaid pronouncements to highlight  how  the\nConstitution Bench  in  <a href=\"/doc/1308768/\" id=\"a_55\">Gurbaksh  Singh  Sibbia</a>  (supra)  had  analysed  and\nexplained the intrinsic underlying concepts under <a href=\"/doc/1783708/\" id=\"a_56\">Section 438</a> of  the  Code,\nthe nature of orders to be passed while conferring the said  privilege,  the\nconditions that are imposable and the discretions to be used by the  courts.\nOn a reading of the said  authoritative  pronouncement  and  the  principles\nthat have been culled out  in  Savitri  Agarwal[18]  there  is  remotely  no\nindication that the Court of Session or the High Court  can  pass  an  order\nthat on surrendering of the  accused  before  the  Magistrate  he  shall  be\nreleased on bail on such terms and conditions as the learned Magistrate  may\ndeem fit and proper or the superior court would impose conditions for  grant\nof bail on such surrender. When the High  Court  in  categorical  terms  has\nexpressed the view that it is not inclined to  grant  anticipatory  bail  to\nthe petitioner-accused it could not  have  issued  such  a  direction  which\nwould tantamount to conferment of benefit by which the accused would  be  in\na position to avoid arrest.</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1308768\" id=\"span_21\">It  is  in  clear  violation  of  the  language\nemployed in the statutory provision and in flagrant violation of the  dictum\n<a href=\"/doc/1308768/\" id=\"a_57\">laid down in</a> <a href=\"/doc/1308768/\" id=\"a_58\">Gurbaksh Singh Sibbia</a> (supra) and the principles culled out  in\nSavitri Agarwal (supra). It is clear as crystal the  court  cannot  issue  a\nblanket order restraining arrest and it can only issue an interim order  and\nthe interim order must also conform to the requirement of  the  section  and\nsuitable conditions should be imposed.”\n\n\nElaborating further, the Court held:-</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">“36. In the case at hand the direction to admit the accused persons to  bail\non their surrendering has no sanction in law and, in fact,  creates  a  dent\nin the sacrosanctity of law. It is contradictory in terms and law  does  not\ncountenance paradoxes. It gains respectability and  acceptability  when  its\nsolemnity is maintained. Passing such kind of orders  the  interest  of  the\ncollective at large and that of the individual victims is jeopardised.  That\napart, it curtails the power of the regular  court  dealing  with  the  bail\napplications.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">37.

We  may  reiterate  that  the  said\norder has been interpreted  by  this  Court  as  an  order  only  issuing  a\ndirection to the accused to  surrender,  but  as  we  find,  it  has  really\ncreated colossal dilemma in the mind  of  the  learned  Additional  Sessions\nJudge. We are pained to say that passing of these kind of orders has  become\nquite frequent and the sagacious saying, “a stitch in time saves  nine”  may\nbe an apposite reminder now.

Sikri, J. in his  concurring  opinion  stated  that  though  the  High\nCourts have very wide powers under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_87\">Article 226</a>, the  very  vastness  of  the\npowers imposes on it the responsibility to use them with circumspection  and\nin  accordance  with  the  judicial   consideration   and   well-established\nprinciples, so much so that while entertaining writ petitions  for  granting\ninterim protection from arrest, the Court would not go on to the  extent  of\nincluding the provision of anticipatory bail as  a  blanket  provision.   It\nhas been further observed that  such  a  power  has  to  be  exercised  very\ncautiously keeping in view,  at  the  same  time,  that  the  provisions  of\n<a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_88\">Article 226</a> are a device to advance justice and not  to  frustrate  it.  The\npowers are, therefore, to be exercised to  prevent  miscarriage  of  justice\nand to prevent abuse of process of law by the  authorities  indiscriminately\nmaking pre-arrest of the accused persons. In entertaining  such  a  petition\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_89\">Article 226</a>, the High Court is supposed to balance the two  interests.\nOn the one hand, the Court is to ensure that such a power under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_90\">Article  226</a>\nis not to be exercised liberally so as to convert it into <a href=\"/doc/1783708/\" id=\"a_91\">Section  438</a>  CrPC\nproceedings, keeping in  mind  that  when  this  provision  is  specifically\nomitted in the State of Uttar Pradesh, it cannot  be  resorted  to  as  back\ndoor entry via <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_92\">Article 226.</a> On the  other  hand,  wherever  the  High  Court\nfinds that in a given case if  the  protection  against  pre-arrest  is  not\ngiven, it would amount to gross miscarriage of justice and no case, at  all,\nis made for arrest pending trial, the High Court would be free to grant  the\nrelief in the nature of anticipatory bail in exercise  of  its  power  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_93\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution. Keeping in mind that this power has  to  be\nexercised sparingly in those cases where  it  is  absolutely  warranted  and\njustified.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"24458802\" id=\"span_38\">23.

The  said  decision,\nneedless to say, has to be read in the context of State  of  Uttar  Pradesh.\nWe do not intend to elaborate the said principle as that  is  not  necessary\nin this case.  What needs to  be  stated  here  is  that  the  States  where\n<a href=\"/doc/1783708/\" id=\"a_97\">Section 438</a> CrPC has not been deleted and kept  on  the  statute  book,  the\nHigh Court should be well advised that while  entertaining  petitions  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_98\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution  or  <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_99\">Section  482</a>  CrPC,  exercise  judicial\nrestraint.  We may hasten to clarify that  the  Court,  if  it  thinks  fit,\nregard being had to  the  parameters  of  quashing  and  the  self-restraint\nimposed by law,  has the jurisdiction to quash  the  investigation  and  may\npass appropriate interim orders as  thought  apposite  in  law,  but  it  is\nabsolutely inconceivable and unthinkable to pass an  order  of  the  present\nnature while declining to interfere or expressing opinion  that  it  is  not\nappropriate to stay  the  investigation.   This  kind  of  order  is  really\ninappropriate and unseemly.  It has no sanction in law.  The  Courts  should\noust  and  obstruct  unscrupulous  litigants  from  invoking  the   inherent\njurisdiction of the Court on the drop of a hat  to file an  application  for\nquashing of launching an FIR or investigation and  then seek  relief  by  an\ninterim order.  It is the obligation of the court to keep such  unprincipled\nand unethical litigants at bay.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1308768\" id=\"span_40\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"110660903\" id=\"span_41\">24.   It has come to the notice of the Court  that  in  certain  cases,  the\nHigh Courts, while dismissing the application under  <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_100\">Section  482</a>  CrPC  are\npassing orders that if the accused-petitioner surrenders  before  the  trial\nmagistrate, he shall be admitted to bail on such  terms  and  conditions  as\ndeemed fit and appropriate  to  be  imposed  by  the  concerned  Magistrate.\nSometimes it is noticed that in a case where sessions  trial  is  warranted,\ndirections are issued  that  on  surrendering  before  the  concerned  trial\njudge, the accused shall be enlarged on bail.   Such  directions  would  not\ncommend acceptance in light of the ratio in  <a href=\"/doc/110660903/\" id=\"a_101\">Rashmi  Rekha  Thatoi</a>  (supra),\n<a href=\"/doc/1308768/\" id=\"a_102\">Gurbaksh Singh Sibbia</a> (supra), etc., for they neither come within the  sweep\nof <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_103\">Article 226</a> of the  Constitution  of  India  nor  <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_104\">Section  482</a>  CrPC  nor\n<a href=\"/doc/1783708/\" id=\"a_105\">Section 438</a> CrPC.</span></span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1774399\" id=\"span_42\">This Court in <a href=\"/doc/1774399/\" id=\"a_106\">Ranjit Singh</a> (supra) had observed that  the\nsagacious saying “a stitch in time saves nine” may be an  apposite  reminder\nand this Court also painfully so stated.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_33\">25.   Having reminded the same, presently we can only say that the types  of\norders like the present one, are totally unsustainable, for it  is  contrary\nto  the  aforesaid  settled  principles  and  judicial  precedents.   It  is\nintellectual truancy to avoid the precedents and issue directions which  are\nnot in consonance with law.  It is the  duty  of  a  Judge  to  sustain  the\njudicial balance and not to think of an order which can cause trauma to  the\nprocess of adjudication.
