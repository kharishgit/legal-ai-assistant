2.4 It was the case of the prosecution that the marriage of the

deceased with Appellant No. 1 was solemnised in the year 2005 and

since the deceased was not having a child for 1.5 years, the appellants

abused her and compelled her to participate in the Pooja and on the

refusal of the same, she was threatened by the appellants that she

would die. Subsequently, the deceased gave birth to a male child

named Rosando by caesarean in the year 2007. Further, the Appellant

No. 1 caused immense mental torture to the deceased by compelling

her to have another child in spite of the fact that the deceased had a

all the domestic household work and was subjected to continuous

cruelty at the hands of the appellants. Due to the same reason, the

deceased was driven to commit suicide on 05.11.2014.



</p><p data-structure="Issue" id="p_10" title="Issue">3.    Thereafter, on completion of the investigation, charge sheet was

filed and cognizance was taken. Since the offences are triable by the

acquitted the father-in-law of the deceased of all the charges.

Appellants filed Criminal Appeal No. 166 of 2021 before the High Court.

committed the offence under <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_21">Sections 498A</a> and <a href="/doc/92983/" id="a_22">306</a> IPC and the Trial

Court rightly appreciated the evidence and convicted the appellants

these allegations in over 9 years of marriage by the deceased or her

bipolar disorder and this fact was not disclosed to the petitioner at the

deceased committed suicide due to abetment by the Appellants.

depressive illness in the past, suicidal attempts, and suicidal ideas.

                 the ratio of the cases decided by the Supreme
                 Court is clear that in order to convict a person
                 under <a href="/doc/92983/" id="a_44">Section 306</a> IPC there has to be a clear
                 mens rea to commit the offence. It also requires
                 an active act or direct act which led the
                 deceased to commit suicide seeing no option
                 and that act must have been intended to push
                 the deceased into such a position that he

           must be a proof of direct or indirect act/s of incitement
           to the commission of suicide. It could hardly be
           disputed that the question of cause of a suicide,
           particularly in the context of an offence of abetment of
           suicide, remains a vexed one, involving multifaceted
           and complex attributes of human behavior and
           responses/reactions. In the case of accusation for
           abetment of suicide, the Court would be looking for
           cogent and convincing proof of the act/s of incitement
           to the commission of suicide. In the case of suicide,
           mere allegation of harassment of the deceased by
           another person would not suffice unless there be such
           action on the part of the accused which compels the
           person to commit suicide; and such an offending
           action ought to be proximate to the time of occurrence.
           Whether a person has abetted in the commission of
           suicide by another or not, could only be gathered from
           the facts and circumstances of each case.
           16.1. For the purpose of finding out if a person has
           abetted commission of suicide by another; the
           consideration would be if the accused is guilty of the
           act of instigation of the act of suicide. As explained

         and reiterated by this Court in the decisions above-
</blockquote><p data-structure="CDiscource" id="p_49" title="Court's Reasoning">         referred, instigation means to goad, urge forward,
         provoke, incite or encourage to do an act. If the
         persons who committed suicide had been
         hypersensitive and the action of accused is otherwise
         not ordinarily expected to induce a similarly
         circumstanced person to commit suicide, it may not be
         safe to hold the accused guilty of abetment of suicide.
         But, on the other hand, if the accused by his acts and
         by his continuous course of conduct creates a
         situation which leads the deceased perceiving no
         other option except to commit suicide, the case may
         fall within the four-corners of <a href="/doc/92983/" id="a_51">Section 306</a> IPC. If the
         accused plays an active role in tarnishing the self-
         esteem and self-respect of the victim, which eventually
         draws the victim to commit suicide, the accused may
         be held guilty of abetment of suicide. The question of
         mens rea on the part of the accused in such cases
         would be examined with reference to the actual acts
         and deeds of the accused and if the acts and deeds
         are only of such nature where the accused intended
         nothing more than harassment or snap show of anger,
         a particular case may fall short of the offence of
         abetment of suicide. However, if the accused kept on
         irritating or annoying the deceased by words or deeds
         until the deceased reacted or was provoked, a
         particular case may be that of abetment of suicide.
         Such being the matter of delicate analysis of human
         behaviour, each case is required to be examined on its
         own facts, while taking note of all the surrounding
         factors having bearing on the actions and psyche of

consult a psychiatrist just a day prior to this incident obviously with the

intention to make her feel better. The said act can by no stretch of

imagination be said to be any such act which may lead the deceased to

commit suicide. Further, the allegations made by PW-1 to PW-3 in their

statement with respect to continuous harassment and torture of the

deceased by the appellants just after the marriage is not worthy of being

relied upon and has to be taken with a pinch of salt on account of fact

that throughout their 9 years of marriage, there has never been any

complaint or a whisper in this regard either by the deceased or her family

members who appeared as prosecution witnesses. Even the deceased

herself who was a qualified doctor never made any complaint in this

regard. It is really hard to believe that a well-educated and self-reliant

meted out to the victim had left the victim with no other alternative but to

put an end to her life. It is also to be borne in mind that in cases of

alleged abetment of suicide, there must be proof of direct or indirect acts

of incitement to the commission of suicide. Merely on the allegation of

harassment without their being any positive action proximate to the time

of occurrence on the part of the accused which led or compelled the

person to commit suicide, conviction in terms of <a href="/doc/92983/" id="a_67">Section 306</a> IPC is not

expressed her disinterest in duty, complained of lack of sleep and not

feeling hungry and also had no interest over anything. Further, PW-9

stated that these were the symptoms of depression. PW-9 in her

summary of treatment report dated 04.11.2014 stated that the deceased

stated cause of sadness for the past 1 month was due to her posting at

the female ward @ IMH and she feels tired, is not interested in working,

that it was also noted in treatment summary by PW-9 that the deceased

had similar depressive illness in the past i.e., 1 st episode during MBBS

college days, had attempted suicide, 2 nd episode post-partum and

present is the third episode. The deceased had suicidal ideas before

going for the consultation with the psychiatrist on 04.11.2014 and the

same is evident from the summary of treatment. However, the evidence

           incite or encourage to do "an act". To satisfy the
           requirement of instigation though it is not necessary
           that actual words must be used to that effect or what
           constitutes instigation must necessarily and
           specifically be suggestive of the consequence. Yet a
           reasonable certainty to incite the consequence must
           be capable of being spelt out. The present one is not
           a case where the accused had by his acts or
           omission or by a continued course of conduct
           created such circumstances that the deceased
           was left with no other option except to commit
           suicide in which case an instigation may have
           been inferred. A word uttered in the fit of anger or
           emotion without intending the consequences to
           actually follow cannot be said to be instigation.
