CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 710 OF 1995 

Mohinder Pal Singh 						Appellant 

Versus 

State of Punjab 							Respondent  

B.N.AGRAWAL, J. 
</p>
<p data-structure="Facts" id="p_2" title="Fact">	The appellants of these two appeals along with accused Bhajan Singh @ 
Harbhajan Singh and Meharban Singh were made accused in a case under 
<a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_1">Section 302</a> of the Indian Penal Code (for short '<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_2">IPC</a>') but as accused Meharban 
Singh died during trial, the remaining three accused persons were tried and  by 
its judgment the trial court acquitted accused Bhajan Singh @ Harbhajan Singh 
whereas these two appellants were convicted under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_3">Section 302</a> IPC and 
sentenced to undergo imprisonment for life and to pay a fine of  Rs. 2,000/- each, 
in default to undergo further imprisonment for a period of six months.   Against 
the order of acquittal of accused Harbhajan Singh, no appeal was filed by the 
State whereas on appeal being filed by the appellants, the High Court confirmed 
their conviction and sentence.   The revision application filed by the private 
prosecutor for enhancement of sentence has been rejected by the High Court. 
	Prosecution case, in short, was that Kuljit Singh @ Billa was a student of 
B.A. Part I in Arya College, Ludhiana and he was a witness in a case filed for 
prosecution of appellant Gurpreet Singh under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_4">Section 307</a> IPC which was 
pending.  On 22nd January, 1990 at about 5.30 p.m., Kuljit Singh along with his 
brother Harvinder Singh and friends Parminder Singh (PW 2) and Gurvinder 
Singh (PW 3) was returning to his house after attending classes from Guru 
Angad Dev College and when they reached near Oriental Public School, the 
appellants along with accused Meharban Singh, who were present there armed 
with kirpans, confronted him.   Appellant Gurpreet Singh shouted that Kuljit Singh 
should be done to death and he attacked him with kirpan on his head.  
Thereafter, appellant Mohinder Pal Singh @ Vicky  inflicted kirpan blow in the 
abdomen of Kuljit Singh.  Accused Meharban Singh assaulted  him with kirpan 
on the temporal region whereupon Kuljit Singh fell down.  In the meantime, 
accused Harbhajan Singh who too was armed with kirpan came there and also 
dealt a kirpan blow on the forehead of Kuljit  
Singh.  All the aforesaid accused persons thereafter inflicted several injuries 
upon Kuljit Singh even after he fell down.  In the process of inflicting injuries, 
appellant Gurpreet Singh also received injuries at the hands of one of the co-
accused.  On halla being raised, people of the locality arrived whereafter the 
accused persons fled away.  Kuljit Singh was taken to Christian Medical Hospital 
by PW 3 and Harvinder Singh where the doctor declared him dead.  Thereupon, 
Harvinder Singh, who was brother of Kuljit Singh  deceased, left for the police 
station but on the Brown Road, near Christian Medical Hospital, he met Sub 
Inspector Bakshish Singh (PW 8) who recorded his statement stating therein the 
aforesaid facts and sent the same to the police station where a case was 
registered against all the aforesaid four accused persons, including the 
appellants on the same day at 7.15 p.m. 
	 Police after registering the case took up investigation and on completion 
thereof submitted charge sheet against the accused persons, on receipt whereof, 
learned magistrate took cognizance and committed all the aforesaid accused 
persons, including the appellants, to the court of Sessions to face trial.  As 
accused Meharban Singh died during trial, the same proceeded against the 
remaining three accused persons.  
</p><p data-structure="Facts" id="p_3" title="Fact">Defence of the accused persons was that they were innocent and were 
falsely implicated in the case in hand.   Specific defence of the  appellants was 
that when they were going to the shop of appellant  Gurpreet Singh  and arrived 
at Jail Road at the time of the present occurrence, Kuljit Singh and his brother 
Upkar Singh were coming from the opposite direction along with one unknown 
person and out of them, Kuljit Singh asked his companions to kill appellant 
Gurpreet Singh whereupon, he was chased and surrounded by Kuljit Singh and 
others and out of them, Upkar Singh stabbed Gurpreet Singh with his knife.  In 
the meantime, upon halla being raised by appellant Gurpreet Singh, villagers 
arrived there who assaulted Kuljit Singh and stating the aforesaid facts, a 
complaint was filed by appellant Gurpreet Singh on 3rd February, 1990 as 
Gurpreet Singh was hospitalized.  
</p><p data-structure="Facts" id="p_4" title="Fact">During the course of trial, the prosecution examined eight witnesses in all, 
out of whom, Dr. I.P.Singh Chhabra (PW 1) was the  doctor who conducted 
postmortem examination on dead body of the deceased.   Parminder Singh         
(PW 2) and Gurvinder Singh (PW 3) claimed to be eyewitnesses to the 
occurrence.    Head Constable Balbir Singh (PW 4) and  Constables Manjit Singh 
(PW 5),  Gurcharan Singh (PW 6) and  Lakhbir Singh (PW 7) were the formal 
witnesses whereas SI Bakshish Singh (PW 8) was the Investigating Officer.   
Informant Harvinder Singh could not be examined as he died before the trial 
commenced. The defence in support of its case examined three witnesses, 
namely, Dr. Subodh Radian (DW 1), who is said to have examined injuries of 
appellant- Gurpreet Singh, and  Tarsem Singh (DW 2) and E.Rai Singh (DW 3) 
were formal witnesses.  Upon the conclusion of trial, accused Harbhajan Singh 
was acquitted whereas the appellants were convicted and their appeal before the 
High Court having failed, as stated above, the present appeals by special leave. 
	In the present case,  presence of the  appellants at the time and place of 
occurrence has not been denied rather admitted.  Appellant Gurpreet Singh is 
said to have been examined by doctor [DW 1] who stated that he found following 
injury on his person:- 
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1" title="Fact">"Penetrating wound on the back of the chest left 8th interracostal 
space, 5 c.m. from midline, 1-5 c.m. x 0.5 c.m, depth not 
ascertained along with left haeopheumethroex."
</blockquote><p data-structure="CDiscource" id="p_5" title="Court's Reasoning">	From the dimension of injury, it would appear that the same was superficial 
one inasmuch as, according to the doctor, even its depth could not be 
ascertained.  The complaint petition was filed by appellant  Gurpreet Singh on 
3rd February, 1990, i.e., after eleven days of the date of the incident and the 
reason for delay disclosed was  that the said appellant was discharged from 
hospital on 3rd of February, 1990.  The doctor (DW 1)  stated that  appellant  
Gurpeet Singh remained  conscious throughout, but,  even then, no explanation is 
forthcoming why  complaint was not filed either by this appellant  himself or  any 
of his relations for a period of eleven days  after the occurrence.  It appears that 
injury was superficial and complaint was filed  after an inordinate delay of eleven 
days  in order to make out a defence in the present case. 
</p><p data-structure="Precedent" id="p_6" title="Precedent Analysis">	 Doctor [PW 1],  who held postmortem examination on the dead body of 
Kuljit Singh, found following injuries:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2" title="Precedent Analysis">1.	Curved incised wound 5" x 1" x bone deep on the left side of 
forehead, extending from bridge of the nose to left ear.  
Underneath bone was cut i.e. frontal and nasal bone.

<p data-structure="Facts" id="p_7" title="Fact">The doctor stated that the deceased died as a result of cumulative effect of 
injuries on the lungs and liver and the same were sufficient to cause death in the 
ordinary course of nature.   According to him, injury Nos. 4,6, 7, 11, 18 and 19 
could have been inflicted by blunt weapon whereas other thirteen injuries by 
incised weapon like kirpan.  So far as injury Nos. 4,6,7,11,18 and 19 are 
concerned, PW 3 stated during the course of cross-examination that even after 
the deceased fell down,  he was assaulted by the accused persons and in order 
to protect himself, he was tossing and rolling on the ground.  As such, the 
aforesaid injuries he might have received during the course of tossing and rolling 
on the ground.  The other injuries were undisputedly caused by kirpan.  Thus, the 
medical evidence supports the prosecution case that the deceased was assaulted 
by the accused persons with kirpan. 
</p><p data-structure="Section" id="p_8" title="Analysis of the law">The two eyewitnesses, namely, Parminder Singh (PW 2) and Gurvinder 
Singh (PW 3) have consistently supported the prosecution case in their 
statements made before the police as well as in Court.  The ground of attack to 
their evidence is that neither in the mortuary register nor in the daily diary [Ex. 
DC] their names were disclosed.   In this connection, reference has been made to 
<a href="/doc/1980578/" id="a_5">Section 154</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure (for short 'the Code') which lays 
down that every information relating to the commission of a cognizable offence 
shall be reduced into writing by the police officer incharge of the police station and 
thereafter substance thereof shall be entered in a book to be kept by such officer 
in such form as the State Government may prescribe in this behalf.  Under  Rule 
24.1 of the Punjab Police Rules, Volume III, 1959 Edition, framed by the State 
Government, it has been prescribed that  substance of the report shall  be 
entered in the Daily Diary.  The relevant part of the Rule reads as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_22" title="Analysis of the law">"Every information covered by <a href="/doc/1980578/" id="a_6">Section 154</a>, Criminal Procedure 
Code, must be reduced to writing as provided in that section and 
substance thereof must be entered in the police station daily diary, 
which is the book provided for the purpose.  It is only information 
which raises a reasonable suspicion of the commission of a 
cognizable offence within the jurisdiction of the police officer to 
whom it is given which compels action under <a href="/doc/279174/" id="a_7">section 157</a>, Criminal

<p data-structure="CDiscource" id="p_9" title="Court's Reasoning">	In the present case, as required under the aforesaid Rules, substance of 
information received under <a href="/doc/1980578/" id="a_8">Section 154</a> Cr.P.C.  has been entered in the daily 
diary  which has been marked as Ex.DC wherein names of all the four accused 
and that of the deceased have been mentioned but so far as names of witnesses 
are concerned, the same have not been disclosed.  It may be stated that under 
<a href="/doc/1034470/" id="a_9">Section 154</a> of the Code as well as  Rule 24.1 of the Rules referred to above, 
what is required to be mentioned in the daily diary  is substance of the information 
received and the same cannot be said to be repository of everything.  Factum of 
murder of Kuljit Singh by the four accused persons, including the appellants, has 
been specifically entered.  If the names of the witnesses have not been 
mentioned, it cannot be said that substance of information received was not 
entered and   there was violation of the provisions of <a href="/doc/1034470/" id="a_10">Section 154</a> read with Rule 
24.1 of the Rules .  Mere non-disclosure of the names of witnesses in the  daily 
diary  as well as mortuary register, ipso facto, cannot affect the prosecution case 
more so, when their names have been disclosed in the first information report 
itself and there is no other circumstance to  otherwise  create doubt regarding 
veracity of the prosecution case.   This being the position, we do not find any 
ground to disbelieve the evidence of PWs 2 and 3.
</p><p data-structure="PetArg" id="p_10" title="Petitioner's Argument">	Mr. Sushil Kumar, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the 
appellant  Gurpreet Singh submitted that there was inordinate delay in sending 
copy of the first information report to the learned magistrate as the case was 
registered on 22nd January, 1990 at 7.15 p.m. but first information report reached 
the concerned magistrate on that night at 0002 hours.  In this regard, reference 
may be made to the evidence of constable Lakhbir Singh (PW 7) who stated that 
the special report of the present case was made over to him at 8.00 p.m. for being 
delivered to the concerned magistrate and other officers.  He further stated that 
first of all, he delivered  copy of the report at the City Control Room, the   
Superintendent of Police (City), Deputy Superintendent of Police (City), Deputy 
Superintendent of Police (Detective), Senior Superintendent of Police, Ludhiana, 
District Control Room and lastly to the concerned magistrate.  As before 
delivering the report to the magistrate, he had delivered its copy at six other 
places, therefore, the report could be delivered to the concerned magistrate at 
0002 hours during night which shows that this witness has taken four hours time 
in delivering report to the magistrate.  In the present case, we do not find that 
there was any delay at all in making over the report to concerned magistrate 
rather the same was very promptly sent and delivered to the learned magistrate.  
That apart, it is well settled that even if there is any delay in sending the special 
report to a magistrate that alone cannot affect the prosecution case if the same is 
otherwise found to be trustworthy.

Court came to the conclusion that by non-framing of the charge under <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_22">Section

view of the fact that under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_23">Section 113-B</a> of the Evidence Act, there was a 
statutory presumption against the accused which he was entitled to rebut and no 
such opportunity of rebuttal  was afforded to him in the absence of charge.  This

judging a question of prejudice, as of guilt, courts must act with a 
broad vision and look to the substance and not to technicalities, 
and their main concern should be to see whether the accused had 
a fair trial, whether he knew what he was being tried for, whether 
the main facts sought to be established against him were 
explained to him fairly and clearly and whether he was given a full 
and fair chance to defend himself. Viewed in the context of the 
above observations of this Court we are unable to hold that the 
accused persons were in any way prejudiced due to the errors and 
omissions in the charges pointed out by Mr. Arunachalam. Apart 
from the fact that this point was not agitated in either of the Courts 
below, from the fact that the material prosecution witnesses (who 
narrated the entire incident) were cross examined at length from all 
possible angles and the suggestions that were put forward to the 
eye witnesses we are fully satisfied that the accused persons were 
not in any way prejudiced in their defence. While on this point we 
may also mention that in their examination under Section 313 of

that in such an eventuality, this Court should first consider the legality or 
otherwise of conviction of the accused and in case the  conviction is upheld, a

accused was juvenile  on the date of  occurrence and upon receipt of the report, 
if it is found that the accused was juvenile on such date and  continues to be so, 
he shall be sent to juvenile home.   But  in case it finds that on the date of the
