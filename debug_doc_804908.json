This Appeal has been preferred against the Judgment and Order dated 21st\n\nDecember, 2001 of the High Court of Gauhati in Criminal Revision (P) No. 578 of\n\n2000 by which the High Court concurred with the finding of facts, recorded by the\n\nTrial Court dated 22.12.1999 passed by the Addl. Chief Judicial Magistrate,\n\nKamrup, Guwahati in Case No. G.R.1957/1997; and of the Appellate Court, the\n\nSessions Judge, Kamrup dated 13.10.2000 passed in Criminal Appeal No.3 of 2000\n\nthat the appellant was guilty of committing the offences under <a href=\"/doc/508426/\" id=\"a_1\">Sections 494</a> and\n\n<a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_2\">498A</a> of the Indian Penal Code (in short &quot;<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_3\">I.P.C</a>&quot;) and sentenced him to undergo\n\nrigorous imprisonment for 2 years<a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_4\"> u/S 498A</a> and for 3 years<a href=\"/doc/508426/\" id=\"a_5\"> u/S 494</a> I.P.C.\n\nHowever, both the sentences were directed to run concurrently.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">\f                                    2</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">2.    The facts and circumstances       giving rise to this appeal are that the\n\nappellant, a Government servant, got married with Smt. Minati Das (Kalita), the\n\ncomplainant on 5.2.1992 as per Hindu rites. Smt. Minati Das (Kalita) gave birth to\n\na male child on 10.3.1993. However, the relationship between the husband and\n\nwife were not cordial as it was alleged by the wife that she was being tortured\n\nmentally and physically by the Appellant. She left the matrimonial home and\n\nstarted living with her father and was residing therein since 1993. In 1997, she\n\ncame to know that the appellant got married with one Ranju Sarma on 2.2.1997 at\n\nTukeswari Temple. Thus, she filed an FIR against the appellant.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_4\">3.    The appellant was charged under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_6\">Sections 498A</a>/<a href=\"/doc/508426/\" id=\"a_7\">494</a> IPC by CJM,\n\nGuwahati. The appellant defended himself before the Trial Court denying all the\n\ncharges. However, considering the evidence on record, the Trial Court found both\n\nthe charges proved against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt and after\n\nconvicting him, for the said offences, awarded the sentences as mentioned here-in-\n\nabove, vide judgment and order dated 22.12.1999. (Annexure P-12)\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">4.    Being aggrieved, the appellant preferred Appeal No.3 of 2000 which was\n\ndismissed by the Appellate Court vide Judgment and Order dated 13.10.2000\n\n(Annexure P-13).\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">\f                                      3</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">5.    The appellant further approached Gauhati High Court by filing Criminal\n\nRevision (P)    No. 578 of 2000 which has been dismissed by the impugned\n\nJudgment and Order dated 21st December, 2001. Hence, this Appeal.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">6.    Shri S.K. Bhattacharya, learned counsel appearing for the appellant has\n\nraised all the contentions which the appellant has raised before the courts below,\n\ninter alia, that there was no valid marriage with Smt. Ranju Sarma as the marriage\n\nhad taken place before a Hindu Deity and that there was no case of mental or\n\nphysical torture to bring home the charges under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 498A</a> IPC. Thus, the\n\nappeal deserved to be allowed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_10\">7.    On the contrary, Mr. Riku Sharma, learned counsel appearing on behalf of\n\nthe respondent State submitted that there are concurrent finding of facts by three\n\ncourts below so far as the issue of marriage of the appellant with Smt. Ranju Sarma\n\nis concerned. This Court should not interfere with the findings so recorded, being\n\nthe fourth court entertaining this matter. So far as the attraction of the provisions of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 498 A </a>is concerned, it was submitted that the appellant subjected the\n\ncomplainant (legally wedded wife) to physical and mental torture and agony; thus\n\nthe charges have rightly been found proved against him by all the three courts.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">\f                                      4</span>\nTherefore, there is no occasion for       this Court to interfere in the matter. The\n\nappeal is liable to be dismissed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">8.    We have considered the rival submissions made by learned counsel for the\n\nparties and perused the record.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">\f                                      5</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_14\">9.    So far as issue no. 1 is            concerned i.e. as to whether the appellant\n\ngot married with Smt. Ranju Sarma, is a pure question of fact. All the three courts\n\nbelow have given concurrent finding regarding the factum of marriage and its\n\nvalidity. It has been held to be a valid marriage.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_15\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"736842\" id=\"span_5\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1791812\" id=\"span_6\">10.   It is settled legal proposition that if the courts below have recorded the\n\nfinding of fact, the question of re-appreciation of evidence by the third court does\n\nnot arise unless it is found to be totally perverse. The higher court does not sit as a\n\nregular court of appeal. It&#x27;s function is to ensure that law is being properly\n\nadministered. Such a court cannot embark upon fruitless task of determining the\n\nissues by re-appreciating the evidence. This Court would not ordinarily interfere\n\nwith the concurrent findings on pure questions of fact and review the evidence\n\nagain unless there are exceptional circumstances justifying the departure from the\n\nnormal practice. The position may undoubtedly be different if the inference is one\n\nof law from the facts admitted and proved or where the finding of fact is materially\n\naffected by violation of any rule of law or procedure.

Mahabir Prasad &amp; Ors.; AIR 1951 SC 177; M/s. <a href=\"/doc/1791812/\" id=\"a_10\">Tulsi Das Khimji Vs.\n\nThe Workmen</a>, AIR 1963 SC 1007; and <a href=\"/doc/736842/\" id=\"a_11\">Pentakota Satyanarayana &amp; Ors.

Where    the    court   below        considered the material facts and did not\n\ntake into consideration any inadmissible evidence etc., the interference is not\n\nrequired by court on third instance. (vide Madhavan Nair vs. Bhaskar Pillai, (2005)\n\n10 SCC 553.)\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">12.    Thus, it is evident from the above that this Court being the fourth Court\n\nshould not interfere with the exercise of discretion by the courts below as the said\n\ncourts have exercised their discretion in good faith giving due weight to relevant\n\nmaterial and without being swayed by any irrelevant material. Even if two views\n\nare possible on the question of fact, we, being the fourth court, should not interfere\n\neven though we may exercise discretion differently had the case come before us\n\ninitially.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_20\">13.    In view of the above, we are not inclined to interfere with the finding of fact\n\nso far as the issue of bigamy is concerned nor the quantum of punishment on this\n\ncount required to be interfered with.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_21\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_22\">14.    Issue no. 2 relates to the applicability of 498A <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_12\">I.P.C</a>. As it has been alleged\n\nby the complainant that she had been given physical and mental torture by the\n\nappellant and it was not possible for her to stay with the appellant after 1993\n\nthough she was having seven months&#x27; pregnancy at that time. She gave birth to a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">\f                                            7</span>\nmale child in the hospital and the              appellant did not even come to see the\n\nchild. The question would arise as to whether in the facts and circumstances where\n\nthe complainant had left the matrimonial home and started living with her father in\n\n1993, could a case be registered against the appellant under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 498A</a> I.P.C. in\n\n1997?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_24\">15.      The provisions of <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 498A</a> IPC read as under :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">                 &quot;498A. Husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to\n         cruelty. - Whoever, being the husband or the relative of the husband of a woman,\n         subjects such woman to cruelty shall be punished with imprisonment for a term\n         which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to fine.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">         Explanation. - For the purposes of this section `cruelty&#x27; means -\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">(a) any welful conduct which is of such a nature as is likely to drive the woman to commit\n    suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health (whether mental or\n    physical) of the woman;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">(b) harassment of the woman where such harassment is with a view to coercing her to any\n    person related to her to meet any unlawful demand for any property or valuable\n    security or is on account of failure by her or any person related to her to meet such\n    demand.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_25\">         Cruelty has been defined by the explanation added to the Section itself. The\n\nbasic ingredients of <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 498A</a> I.P.C. are cruelty and harassment. In the instant\n\ncase, as the allegation of demand of dowry is not there, we are not concerned with\n\nclause (b) of the explanation. The elements of cruelty so far as clause (a) is\n\nconcerned, have been classified as follows :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">      (i) any `wilful&#x27; conduct which is of such a nature as is likely to drive the woman to\n           commit suicide; or\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">      (ii) any `wilful&#x27; conduct which is likely to cause grave injury to the woman; or\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">\f                                             8</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">      (iii) any `wilful&#x27; act which is likely to  cause danger to life, limb or health,\n           whether physical or mental of the woman.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">16.      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"917877\" id=\"span_10\">In <a href=\"/doc/917877/\" id=\"a_16\">S. Hanumantha Rao v. S. Ramani</a>, AIR 1999 SC 1318, this Court\n\nconsidered the meaning of cruelty in the context of the provisions under <a href=\"/doc/1284729/\" id=\"a_17\">Section13</a>\n\nof the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 and observed that :</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">                 &quot;mental cruelty broadly means, when either party causes mental pain,\n         agony or suffering of such a magnitude that it severs the bond between the wife\n         and husband and as a result of which it becomes impossible for the party who has\n         suffered to live with the other party. In other words, the party who has committed\n         wrong is not expected to live with the other party.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\">17. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1848484\" id=\"span_11\">In <a href=\"/doc/1848484/\" id=\"a_18\">V.

While arriving at such conclusion,\n         regard must be had to the social status, educational level of the parties, the society\n         they move in, the possibility or otherwise of the parties ever living together in case\n         they are already living apart and all other relevant facts and circumstances which\n         it is neither possible nor desirable to set out exhaustively. What is cruelty in one\n         case may not amount to cruelty in another case. It is a matter to be determined in\n         each case having regard to the facts and circumstances of that case. If it is a case\n         of accusations and allegations, regard must also be had to the context in which they\n         were made........... The context and the set up in which the word `cruelty&#x27; has been\n         used in the section seems to us, that intention is not necessary element in cruelty.\n         That word has to be understood in the ordinary sense of the term in matrimonial\n         affairs. If the intention to harm, harass or hurt could be inferred by the nature of\n         the conduct or brutal act complained of, cruelty could be easily established. But\n         the absence of intention should not make any difference in the case, if by ordinary\n         sense in human affairs, the act complained of could otherwise be regarded as\n         cruelty.&quot;\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">\f                                          9</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">18.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"200402\" id=\"span_13\">In <a href=\"/doc/200402/\" id=\"a_20\">Mohd.

In other\n      words, each case has to be decided on its own facts to decide whether the mental\n      cruelty was established or not.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">19.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"893384\" id=\"span_14\">In <a href=\"/doc/893384/\" id=\"a_21\">Smt.

The instant case required to be examined taking into consideration the\n\naforesaid settled legal provisions. Undoubtedly, there had been complaint by the\n\nwife of physical and mental torture upto 1993 when she left the matrimonial home\n\nand started living with her father. The complaint of cruelty was lodged by filing an\n\nFIR on 23.5.1997 i.e. after four years of leaving the matrimonial home. More so,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">\f                                        11</span>\nthe mental or physical torture was           not continuous on the part of the appellant\n\nas there is no complaint against him between 1993 to 1997 i.e. leaving the\n\nmatrimonial home by the wife and performing the second marriage by the husband.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_37\">24.   The complainant Smt.

Similarly, Shri\n\nLakhi Kt. Das (P.W.1), the father of the complainant has not mentioned any\n\nincident of physical or mental torture after 1993. None of the witnesses examined\n\nin this respect deposed that there was a continuous physical or mental torture and\n\nsome untoward incident occurred between the husband and wife after 1993.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">25.

But it further held as under :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">      &quot;No doubt there is no evidence on the record to show that the accused committed\n      harassment on P.W.3 with a view to force her to commit suicide or to fulfil illegal\n      demands of him. The continuous harassment, both physical and mental by the\n      accused made her life miserable and forced her to live separately from her\n      husband.&quot; (Emphasis added)\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">26.    The Appellate Court dealt with the issue as under :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">      &quot;Her specific evidence is that the cruelty both physical and mental was meted to\n      her by her husband after the marriage and this has been well supported by the\n      evidence of the witnesses as discussed above. Her mental torture had reached to\n      such an extent that she had to leave her matrimonial home along with the baby in\n      the womb and this has been well testified in the evidence on record.&quot; (emphasis\n      added)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">\f                                          12</span>\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\">27.   The High Court considered the issue and reached the conclusion :\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">              &quot; The offence<a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_32\"> u/S 498 A </a>IPC is punishable with imprisonment upto three\n      years only and as such the prosecution is barred<a href=\"/doc/1599077/\" id=\"a_33\"> u/S468</a>, Cr.P.C. In view of the\n      catena of decisions of the Apex Court, the law is well settled that offence of cruelty\n      to wife is a continuing offence. Hence the fact that the wife was not living with the\n      husband since 1993 is immaterial and mental and other cruelty may be committed\n      even after the parties living separately.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\">      The High Court further held that during the subsistence of the marriage, the\n\nappellant contracted second marriage and started living with the another woman\n\nthat itself was a cruelty and therefore he was liable for the punishment under\n\nSection 498 A.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_42\">28.   Thus, from the above, it is evident that the Trial Court itself had been of the\n\nview that there was no evidence of cruelty on the part of the appellant with a view\n\nto drive the complainant to commit suicide.             The appellate Forum reached the\n\nconclusion that mental torture was of the magnitude that the complainant had to\n\nleave her matrimonial home during her pregnancy. The Revisional court did not\n\nfind that the complainant had been subjected to cruelty continuously.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_43\">29.   Thus, in our opinion, all the three courts below erred in not considering the\n\ncase in correct perspective. The findings so recorded by the Courts below may be\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">\f                                        13</span>\nrelevant for granting the relief in a        matrimonial dispute i.e. divorce etc. but\n\ncould not bring home the charge under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 498-A</a> IPC.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_44\">30.   Thus, in view of the aforesaid, conviction of the appellant under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_35\">Section\n\n498-A</a> IPC and punishment for the said offence awarded by the courts below are\n\nset aside.    However, conviction and sentence under <a href=\"/doc/508426/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 494</a> IPC are\n\nmaintained.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_45\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_46\">31.   Appeal succeeds to the said extent and disposed of accordingly.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\">                                                 .........................................J.\n                                                 (Dr. Mukundakam Sharma)\n\n\n\n\n                                                 .........................................J.\n                                                 (Dr. B.S.
