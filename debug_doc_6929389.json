The present appeal is directed against the common judgment dated\n10.07.2014 passed by the learned Metropolitan Magistrate (NI Act)-041 Tis\nHazari Courts, New Delhi in CC No. 76/10, whereby the complaint\npreferred by the appellant under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 138</a> of the Negotiable Instruments\nAct (the <a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_2\">NI Act</a>), was rejected, and the respondents/accused were acquitted.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">Crl.

The case of the complainant/appellant is that the complainant, along\nwith her four other sisters (who have also preferred identical complaints in\nrespect of dishonoured cheques issued in their individual favour) are the\nowners of the premises - J-2/22, Rajouri Garden, New Delhi having 1/5th\nundivided share each. The aforesaid property is a freehold property\nconsisting of basement, ground floor, first floor and second floor with roof\nrights. All the sisters/ complainants had appointed one Mr. Vipin Batra as\ntheir Attorney by way of a GPA dated 23.06.2008, and through him entered\ninto five lease agreements on 18.07.2008-all marked as Ex.CW-1/DA, with\nthe accused in respect of the undivided share of each of the sisters in the\naforesaid premises for a period of nine years, at a total monthly rent of\nRs. 5,50,000/- (before TDS deduction). The share of rent of each sister was\nRs. 1,10,000/-. The respondents leased the property for the purpose of\nrunning a Restaurant under the name &amp; style of „Kabab Factory‟. The first\nthree months, starting from the 1st July, 2008 to 30th September, 2008, was\nto be the rent free period for the purposes of carrying out the necessary\nworks for the commencement of the restaurant business. The obligation for\npayment of the rent was to commence from 1st October, 2008 onwards. The\nperiod of nine years was divided, for the purposes of computation of\nmonthly rent, into four slabs, as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">     i) Monthly rent for the period 1st July, 2008 to 30th September, 2008\n        shall be Nil.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">        (This period of 3 months will be treated as free for fit out to\n        commence the restaurant)\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">Crl.

At the time of the execution of the lease agreement, security deposit\nof an amount equivalent to three months rent was made by the accused. In\naddition to that, the accused/ lessee also issued 12 post dated cheques qua\neach lease agreement to each complainant/ lessors as advance rent, totaling\n60 cheques for the period of 01.10.2008 to 30.09.2009. The said cheques\nwere handed over to each of the complainants at the time of execution of\neach of the lease agreements i.e. on 18.07.2008 in pursuance of Clause (4) of\nthe lease agreements-which are all having identical terms and conditions.\nClause 4 of each of the lease agreements, insofar as it is relevant reads: &quot;the\nlessee has also submit 12 post dated cheques at the time of execution of this\nlease deed as advance for monthly rent....&quot; Each of the cheques were drawn\nfor the amount of Rs. 91,300/- (After TDS deduction on rent of Rs.\n1,10,000/-).       Of these 60 cheques, 47 got dishonoured upon presentation,\nleading to filing of 47 separate complaints qua each dishonoured cheque.\nThe details of the complaint, wherefrom the present appeal arises, are as\nfollows:\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">Crl. A. 679/2015                                                     Page 3 of 31</span>\n<pre id=\"pre_2\">     CC No.              Complainant        Cheque dated        Cheque No.\n76/01                  Sangeeta Batra       06.04.2009          017198\n\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\">4.         However, the restaurant never commenced business as the necessary\npermissions for the installation of the lift and other alterations were not\nprocured within time, though the accused remained in occupation of the\naforesaid property. Subsequently, the aforesaid property was booked and\nsealed by the MCD for unauthorized construction/ excess coverage in\nviolation of bye-laws. On 13.04.2009, a portion of the basement and third\nfloor were sealed, and the rest of the property was sealed on 12.09.2009.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\">5.         The learned MM set out the fivefold defence of the accused as\nfollows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">     i)     Complaint being still born, having not been filed by competent\n     attorney;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">     ii)    Lease Agreement is as agreement void ab-initio, being an agreement\n     forbidden by law/against public policy;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">     iii) Lease Agreement is a voidable contract, on account of\n     misrepresentation/concealment of material information by the lessor;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">     iv) Lease Agreement having got frustrated; the accused/lessee is\n     absolved from payment of rent;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">     v) The final defence is that the cheques were issued not in discharge of\n     a subsisting liability but as advance/security cheques.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">Crl. A. 679/2015                                                    Page 4 of 31</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\"> 6.     He returned findings on the first three issues aforesaid in favour of the\nappellants/complainants. It was held that the complaint had been filed by\nthe competent authority and that lease agreements were not void ab initio as\nthey were not agreements forbidden by law or against public policy. It was\nalso held that there was no misrepresentation or concealment of material\ninformation by the lessor. After holding that the lease agreement entered\ninto were valid and were neither void nor voidable, the learned MM\nproceeded to consider whether the contract subsequently became void on\naccount of sealing of the premises by the MCD.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">7.     In this context, the learned MM considered the issue whether the\nagreement got frustrated on account of sealing and inability of the\nrespondent/accused/lessees to use the leased premises, thereby discharging\nthe respondent/accused of their liability to pay rent. On this issue as well,\nthe learned MM returned a finding in favour of the appellant/complainant\nholding that the doctrine of frustration would not absolve the parties from\ncomplying with the terms of the contract. The contract contained in the\nlease agreement could not be said to have been frustrated on account of\nsupervening third party conduct, and that the parties were under an\nobligation to perform their part of the contract. Finally, the learned MM\nconsidered the issue whether the cheques in question had been issued, not in\ndischarge of a subsisting liability, but as advance/security cheques.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">8.     On this aspect, the learned MM held that the rent becomes due or\naccrues on the utilization of the premises for the purpose for which it was\ntaken. Since the premises was sealed, it could not be utilized by the\nrespondent for the purpose of running a restaurant. The cheques in question\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">Crl. A. 679/2015                                                        Page 5 of 31</span>\n were advance cheques and were issued prior to the crystallized liability\nhaving arisen. Reliance was placed on the judgment of the Supreme Court\nin M/s Indus Airways Pvt. Ltd. vs M/s Magnum Aviation Pvt. Ltd., IV\n(2014) SLT 321, and in particular on the following extract from the said\njudgment:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">       &quot;13. The explanation appended to <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 138</a> explains the\n       meaning of the expression „debt or other liability‟ for the\n       purpose of <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 138</a>. This expression means a legally\n       enforceable debt or other liability. <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 138</a> treats\n       dishonoured cheque as an offence, if the cheque has been\n       issued in discharge of any debt or other liability. The\n       explanation leaves no manner of doubt that to attract an\n       offence under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 138</a>, there should be legally enforceable\n       debt or other liability subsisting on the date of drawal of the\n       cheque. In other words, drawal of the cheque in discharge of\n       existing or past adjudicated liability is sine qua non for\n       bringing an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 138</a>. If a cheque is issued as\n       an advance payment for purchase of the goods and for any\n       reason purchase order is not carried to its logical conclusion\n       either because of its cancellation or otherwise, and material or\n       goods for which purchase order was placed is not supplied, in\n       our considered view, the cheque cannot be held to have been\n       drawn for an existing debt or liability. The payment by cheque\n       in the nature of advance payment indicates that at the time of\n       drawal of cheque, there was no existing liability...&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_15\">9.      The learned MM held that, since the cheques in question had been\nreceived by the complainants in advance at the time of execution of the lease\ndeeds and the property could not be used for the intended purpose, the\ndishonour of the cheques in question would not entail an action under\n<a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">Crl. A. 679/2015                                                   Page 6 of 31</span>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_16\"> 10.    Learned counsel for the appellant submits that the impugned\njudgment is misdirected in law and it is based on erroneous view of law. He\nsubmits that the impugned judgment has resulted in grave miscarriage of\njustice. While the learned MM has returned findings of fact in favour of the\nappellant/complainant on all the issues, only on account of the fact that the\ncheques in question had been issued in advance towards payment of rent and\nthe liability for payment of rent arise month to month, the learned MM has\nconcluded that the dishonour of the cheque in question could not be the basis\nof a complaint under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act.           For reaching this\nconclusion, the learned MM has placed reliance on the judgment of the\nSupreme Court in Indus Airways (supra). Learned counsel submits that this\nis on account of a superficial reading of the said judgment, and its\nmisapplication to the facts of the present case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_17\">11.    Learned counsel submits that the learned MM has failed to appreciate\nthat there was no question of suspending the obligation to make payment of\nrent on account of the sealing of the leased premises, as the respondents had\nthe option to surrender the lease. So long as the lease was not surrendered,\nmerely on account of the sealing of the leased premises, the obligation to\npay rent did not get suspended or ceased. Whether, or not, the respondents\nwere able to use the premises for the intended purpose, namely, to set up a\nrestaurant, was not relevant or material. Learned counsel submits that when\nthe premises was let out by the appellant along with the other four sisters,\nthere was no notice by the Municipal Corporation pending.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_18\">12.    Learned counsel submits that the building was booked vide letter\ndated 17.10.2008, whereas the premises had been leased to the respondent\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">Crl. A. 679/2015                                                   Page 7 of 31</span>\n on 18.07.2008. Learned counsel submits that the building was not sealed for\nwant of completion certificate and that the said sealing had taken place on\naccount of unauthorized construction. It was booked on 17.10.2008 for\nexcess coverage of basement, ground floor, first floor and additional second\nfloor. It was again booked on 20.06.2009 for unauthorized construction of\nbasement, ground floor, first floor, second floor and third floor. Learned\ncounsel has referred to the testimony of DW-1, Sh. S.K. Gupta, A.E.\n(Building), SDMC, West Zone, New Delhi and in particular to his cross\nexamination recorded on 20.02.2013 in this regard.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_19\">13.    Learned counsel submits that under the terms of the lease agreement,\nthe respondents/lessees were obliged to obtain all the requisite permission\nbefore undertaking any additions or alteration in the lease premises. In this\nregard, reference is made to the following clauses of the lease deeds dated\n18.07.2008 which are identical and which were all marked as CW-1/DA:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">       &quot;f) The Lessee shall not make or permit to be made any\n       structural addition on the roof except the lift room and a\n       temporary shed for generator set approx. measuring 10ft. ×\n       12ft. In case any liability like property tax, penalties, duties,\n       fines etc is imposed by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi,\n       Delhi Development Authority or any other concerned\n       Department/ Authority on account of the Lessee‟s use of the\n       roof, the Lessee shall be liable for the same.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">       g)     Also it is expressly agreed that in case any proceedings\n       are commenced or liability, if any sort arises on account of any\n       breach of any statutory, mandatory or regulatory provisions,\n       then the Lessee shall be wholly and solely responsible to defend\n       the said proceedings and consequences thereof, whether civil or\n       criminal shall be solely borne by the Lessee.

Learned counsel submits that the respondent/accused undertook\nunauthorized construction of the third floor between the first booking-which\ntook place on 17.10.2008, and the second booking-which took place on\n20.06.2009, when the premises was already leased out to the respondents.\nLearned counsel submits that DW-1 S.K.Gupta admitted that as per Master\nPlan 2021, the property in question, which is on Najafgarh Road is permitted\nfor commercial use and can be used commercially for running a restaurant.\nHe also admitted that the complainant had paid the conversion charges vide\nreceipts dated 19.06.2008 and 30.06.2008.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">Crl.

Learned counsel submits that, in any event, the respondents by opting\nto hold on to the lease premises even after its sealing, and not surrendering\nthe lease, incurred the liability to pay the rent.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_22\">16.    On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent submits that the\nappellant and the other co-owners were responsible for the sealing of the\npremises. In this regard, clause 7(b) of the lease deed Ex. CW-1/DA is\nreferred to, which reads as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">       &quot;b) The Lessor hereby warrants and represents that the\n       Lessor being the owner of 1/5th undivided share of the said\n       Demised Premises and being fully entitled to execute this Lease\n       deed will hold the Lessee free and harmless of any demands,\n       claims, actions or proceedings by any authorities, local body or\n       interference from any other person with the Lessee‟s possession\n       and enjoyment of the Demised Premises. The Lessor further\n       assures that the Demised Premises is not subject matter of any\n       pending litigation, acquisition proceedings, by reason whereof\n       the Lessor is prohibited from leasing the same.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_23\">17.    Learned counsel submits that sealing took place on account of\nunauthorized construction on all the floors including basement, ground and\nfirst floor as stated by DW-1. The booking first took place on 17.10.2008\nfor excess coverage at basement, ground, first floor and addition to second\nfloor. It is submitted that on account of the said illegalities committed by\nthe appellant and the other co-owners, the premises came to be sealed and\nthe respondent could not put the premises to use and, therefore, there was no\nobligation to make payment of rent for the period that the premises remained\nsealed.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">Crl.

This position is rather well settled. As early as in 1973, this Court in\nChamber of Colours and Chemicals Pvt. Ltd. v. Trilokchand Jain, 1973\n(9) DLT 510 dealt with this issue. In this case, proceedings were initiated\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/152548910/\" id=\"a_26\">Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958</a>, inter alia, on the ground of non\npayment of rent by the tenant. The Rent Controller passed an order under\n<a href=\"/doc/1370898/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 15(1)</a> of the said Act, directing deposit of arrears of rent and\ndirecting payment of interim rent from month to month. During pendency\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">Crl.

The tenant did not deposit the interim rent fixed by the Controller.\nConsequently, the landlord moved an application under <a href=\"/doc/1370898/\" id=\"a_28\">section 15(7)</a> of the\nsaid Act praying that the defence of the tenant be struck out.            The\ntenant/appellant then contended that the landlord was not entitled to claim\nrent as part of the premises had been destroyed by fire, and the landlord had\nrefused-either to reconstruct the destroyed premises, or permit the\nappellant/tenant to do so. The application of the landlord under <a href=\"/doc/1370898/\" id=\"a_29\">section\n15(7)</a> was rejected by the Rent Controller. However, in first appeal, the\nRent Control Tribunal allowed the appeal of the respondent/landlord.\nConsequently, the tenant preferred a second appeal before the High Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_38\">29.    This Court rejected the appellants/tenants submission that it had the\nright to suspend the payment of rent on the destruction of the premises and\nupon the refusal of the respondent/landlord to either reconstruct himself, or\npermit the tenant to do so. The discussion in the said decision reads as\nfollows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1291439\" id=\"span_27\">&quot;8. On the second point on merits, it is contended that it was\n       the appellants&#x27; right to suspend payment of rent on the\n       destruction of the premises and upon the refusal of the\n       respondent either to reconstruct it himself or permit the\n       appellants to do so. Let me first examine the position under the\n       <a href=\"/doc/515323/\" id=\"a_30\">Transfer of Property Act</a>. In the case of the tenancy premises\n       being wholly destroyed or rendered substantially and\n       permanently unfit by fire etc. for the purposes for which it\n       was let, the only right given to the lessee by <a href=\"/doc/179502765/\" id=\"a_31\">section 108(e)</a> of\n       the Transfer of Property Act is to exercise the option of\n       treating the lease to be void. In such a case the lessee cannot\n       continue to hold on to the premises or say that the lease\n       continues but he will not pay the rent. If the lessee does not\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">Crl.

It is a matter of option with the\n               lessee to get rid of the lease or not. He could treat\n               it as void if he so desired. But the law does not\n               compel him to do so. This aspect of the matter\n               makes it all the more necessary that an\n               unambiguous declaration of the lessee&#x27;s intention\n               to treat the lease as void must be communicated to\n               the Lesser. The Lesser would not otherwise be able\n               to take appropriate steps on the footing that the\n               lease has come to an end and he is Therefore at\n               liberty to deal with the property as he chooses.\n               What is even more important is that a mere\n               declaration of intention to treat the lease as void is\n               not sufficient. The lessee must also yield up\n               possession of the property to the Lesser as\n               required by the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/51831632/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 108(q)</a> of\n               the Transfer of Property Act. He cannot continue\n               in possession and yet declare that he has treated\n               the lease as void. That would obviously be an\n               inconsistent and impermissible position to adopt.\n               So long as a lessee has not surrendered to his\n               Lesser the possession which he obtained from the\n               latter at the time of the lease. he cannot rid\n               himself of his obligations under the lease. His\n               holding to the possession into which he was\n               inducted by his Lesser will estop him from\n               disputing the right of his Lesser to evict him and\n               to recover possession from him.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_39\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"52458288\" id=\"span_30\">9.

Even if one were to proceed on the\nassumption that the appellant and the other co-owners had made excess\ncoverage on the basement and upper floors of the leased premises even prior\nto the grant of the lease, and it was that excess coverage which led to the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">Crl.

The respondent/lessees took the premises on lease with open eyes.\nEven if it were to be accepted for the sake of argument, that the premises\nwas taken by them on lease unmindful of the excess coverage on the\nbasement and upper floors, and that the said illegality was latent, the\nconsequent sealing of the leased premises would not entitle the\nrespondent/lessee to suspend their obligation to pay the rent unilaterally\nwhen the lease has not been avoided.      Their only option was to surrender\nthe lease and claim damages for the losses that they may have suffered on\naccount of them being leased a premises with such defects.

The learned MM has placed heavy reliance on the judgment of the\nSupreme Court in Indus Airways (supra). <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"27480510\" id=\"span_70\">This Court had the occasion to\nconsider Indus Airways (supra) in another recent decision in <a href=\"/doc/27480510/\" id=\"a_80\">Credential\nLeasing &amp; Credits Ltd v. Shruti Investments &amp; Anr</a>, Crl. Appeal No.\n729/2015 decided on 28.06.2015 I may set out herein below the relevant\nextract from <a href=\"/doc/27480510/\" id=\"a_81\">the said decision</a>:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">       &quot;20. It is the observation made by the Supreme Court in Indus\n       Airways (supra) - that the dishonoured cheque should be in\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_71\">Crl. A. 679/2015                                                  Page 27 of 31</span>\n        relation to a debt or other liability subsisting on the date of\n       drawal of the cheque, to be able to maintain a complaint under\n       <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_82\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act, which is the cornerstone of the legal\n       submission of the respondents/ accused.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">       21. On a closer scrutiny of the decision in Indus Airways\n       (supra), it appears to me that Indus Airways (supra) has no\n       application to the facts of the present case as the above\n       extracted observations were made in a materially different\n       factual background. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"144941788\" id=\"span_72\">I have consciously extracted paragraph 35\n       from the decision in <a href=\"/doc/144941788/\" id=\"a_83\">Suresh Chandra Goyal</a> (supra), wherein\n       this Court has taken note of the settled legal position on the\n       aspect as to how the observations in an earlier judgment of the\n       Supreme Court have to be read and applied in subsequent\n       cases.</span> As noticed above, in Indus Airways (supra), the\n       purchaser issued advance cheques with the two purchase\n       orders. Before the supplies under the purchase orders was\n       made, the purchaser/accused cancelled the two purchase\n       orders (which was not in dispute), and requested the\n       complainant to return the cheques. The cheque was presented\n       and dishonoured. As a result, a complaint was preferred. The\n       Supreme Court dismissed the complaint on the ground that\n       there was no existing liability between the parties since the\n       contract had been terminated. Thus, on the date of presentation\n       of the cheques for encashment, there was no existing\n       ascertained and liquidated liability or debt. The cheques had\n       been given in advance towards the sale consideration, and not\n       for realisation of unascertained damages that may arise on\n       account of wrongful termination of the purchase order by the\n       purchaser. It was held that there was no debt or other liability\n       existing relatable to the cheque, since the contracts stood\n       terminated on the date of presentation of the cheque. At best,\n       only a civil liability existed in damages.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">       22. However, in the present case, the liability or debt is\n       claimed to have arisen under the contract in respect of which\n       the dishonoured cheque was issued. The cheque was issued\n       precisely to secure the debt/ liability that may arise under the\n       contract on account of the accused undertaking the share sale/\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_73\">Crl. A. 679/2015                                                  Page 28 of 31</span>\n        purchase transactions on credit basis through the appellant\n       broker. Thus, the decision in Indus Airways (supra) cannot be\n       mechanically applied in the present case.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">       23. In Indus Airways (supra), the earlier decision in Beena\n       Shabeer (supra) was not brought to the notice of the Supreme\n       Court and was, therefore, not considered. Both Indus Airways\n       (supra) and Beena Shabeer (supra) are decisions of co-equal\n       benches. In Beena Shabeer (supra), the Supreme Court did not\n       approve the decision in Shreenivasan (supra) wherein the High\n       Court had held that when a cheque is issued as a security, no\n       complaint will lie under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_84\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act. Thus, if the\n       observations made by the Supreme Court in Indus Airways\n       (supra) are understood as laying down a general legal\n       proposition that on the date of issuance of the cheque the\n       debt/other liability should be subsisting to maintain a complaint\n       under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_85\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act, the same would not align with\n       the ratio laid down in the earlier decision in Beena Shabeer\n       (supra).\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">       24. As noticed above, in Indus Airways (supra) the Supreme\n       Court was considering the fact situation wherein the purchase\n       order was not executed with supply of the contracted goods\n       and, thus, the cheque issued by the purchaser towards advance\n       payment was held as not covered by <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_86\">Section 138</a> of NI Act. But\n       what happens, where the purchaser while placing the purchase\n       order issues in advance a post-dated cheque; goods/ services\n       are supplied in terms of the contract, and; the post-dated\n       cheque upon presentation on the due date gets dishonoured.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_69\">       The Supreme Court was not dealing with such a fact situation.\n       Could it be said that, because there was no pre-existing or pre-\n       determined debt or other liability on the date of issue of the\n       cheque by the purchaser (as the goods/ services were supplied\n       only after the issuance of the post-dated cheque), a complaint\n       under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_87\">Section 138</a> NI Act would not lie?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_70\">       25. In my view, it would defeat the object of <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_88\">Section 138</a> NI\n       Act to hold that the seller/ service provider cannot enforce his\n       right conferred by <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_89\">Section 138</a> NI Act in such a situation, as it\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_74\">Crl. A. 679/2015                                                   Page 29 of 31</span>\n        would encourage dishonest buyers to evade their penal liability.\n       It would erode the efficacy and credibility of commercial\n       transactions undertaken on the basis of post-dated cheques, or\n       cheques issued towards advance payment, with a credit period.\n       The view of the Supreme Court in Indus Airways (supra) does\n       not appear to take out from the scope of <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_90\">Section 138</a> NI Act\n       cases of this nature, as what fell for examination was a fact\n       situation where the advance cheque had been issued along with\n       the purchase order, and the supply of goods was not made for\n       whatever reason.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_71\">       26.     The Explanation to <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_91\">Section 138</a> NI Act reads:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\">               &quot;Explanation -For the purposes of this section,\n               &quot;debt or other liability&quot; means a legally\n               enforceable debt or other liability.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_72\">       27. Thus, the &quot;debt or other liability&quot; has to be a legally\n       enforceable debt or other liability. Neither the main provision\n       of <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_92\">Section 138</a>, nor the explanation suggest that the debt or\n       other liability should be in existence on the date of issuance of\n       the cheque, i.e. on the date of its delivery to the drawee or\n       someone on his behalf or, on the date that the cheque bears.\n       The only reference to time in the Section, is the point of time\n       when the cheque is returned unpaid by the drawers bank.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_73\">44.    Thus, the decision in Indus Airways (supra) too had no application in\nthe facts of the present case as that was a case where advance cheques had\nbeen issued against the purchase order, which was cancelled before its\nexecution. Consequently, the consideration had not passed from the seller to\nthe buyer - who was the drawer of the cheque. It could not be said that the\nsaid cheque had been issued in discharge of a debt or other liability. The\nsame cannot be said about the present case for the reason that the advance\ncheques had been issued towards payment of rent by the respondent/lessees.\nThe respondents continued to remain tenants and incurred the liability to pay\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_75\">Crl. A. 679/2015                                                   Page 30 of 31</span>\n rent month to month. The advance cheques issued towards payment of rent\nwhen deposited for realization of the rent for the said period were\ndishonoured upon presentation. The respondent/lessees incurred the liability\nto pay the rent as they continued to retain possession even though the same\nhad been sealed by the municipal authorities. Thus, reliance placed on\nIndus Airways (supra) by the learned MM is completely misplaced and this\nis yet another serious error of law found in the impugned judgment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_74\">45.    For all the aforesaid reasons, the present appeal is allowed and the\nimpugned judgment is set aside. The respondents are convicted of the\noffences under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_93\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_75\">                                                      (VIPIN SANGHI)\n                                                          JUDGE\n\n\nJULY 01, 2015\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">Crl.
