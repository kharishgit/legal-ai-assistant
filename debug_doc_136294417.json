At that time, the account of the employee was\n\nsettled and a sum of Rs.2,89,205.54/- was outstanding towards salary etc. In\n\norder to discharge the said liability, four post dated cheques drawn at HDFC\n\nBank, Faridabad were issued in favour of the complainant by the said\n\ncompany which were signed by authorized signatory i.e. petitioner (accused\n\nNo.2). According to the complaint, only Rs.2,15,181/- was due and\n\nrecoverable, as a sum of Rs.74,024/- was paid in cash after return of the\n\ncheque bearing No.005106. The cheques bearing Nos.005108 and 005109\n\nupon presentation were returned by drawee-Bank through return memo\n\ndated 14.09.2017 with remarks &quot;Account Blocked&quot;. The complainant\n\nproceeded to serve the statutory notice dated 04.10.2017 which was served\n\nupon the accused persons on 09.10.2017. The complaint further revealed that\n\nthe accused had sent the reply dated 16.10.2017 to the said legal notice,\n\nwherein a false and frivolous defence had been set up to evade the payment\n\nof the dues to the complainant. Finally, as the demand raised by the\n\ncomplainant was not adhered to, therefore, it compelled the complainant to\n\ninstitute a complaint dated 13.11.2017 seeking prosecution of the accused\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_6\">Sections 138</a>, <a href=\"/doc/686130/\" id=\"a_7\">141</a> and <a href=\"/doc/595945/\" id=\"a_8\">142</a> NI Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">            In support of the complaint, complainant-Narender Singh\n\n\n\n\n                               3 of 15\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">            ::: Downloaded on - 14-07-2019 01:26:48 :::</span>\n CRM-M-14537-2018 and other connected matters                    -4-\n\nexamined himself as CW-1 in the pre-summoning evidence and the\n\ndocuments Exhibit C-1 to Exhibit C-15 were also tendered. The trial Court\n\nafter examining the pre-summoning evidence and the fact that the alleged\n\ncheques were dishonoured with the remarks &quot;account blocked&quot; proceeded to\n\nsummon the accused persons for the offence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 138</a>\n\nNI Act alone vide impugned order dated 14.11.2017 (Annexure P-2). In the\n\nother connected petitions summoning order in each complaint was passed on\n\n14.11.2017, 18.12.2017, respectively.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">            Pursuant to the notice of motion, the respondent had appeared\n\nthrough their counsel, however, no reply was filed by the contesting\n\nrespondent (complainant).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">            Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that as per the\n\ncomplainant himself, the cheques given were post-dated and on the given\n\ndate when the cheques were presented, the account of the company already\n\nstood blocked. The provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 138</a> NI Act clearly contemplate\n\nthat the dishonour of the cheque is punishable only if it is dishonoured either\n\non the ground of &quot;insufficient funds&quot; or that the &quot;amount exceeds the\n\narrangement with the Bank&quot;. Learned counsel has contended that since none\n\nof these two conditions are fulfilled, therefore, no offence is made out and\n\nCourt below committed serious error in law in proceeding to summon the\n\npetitioner as an accused.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">            Attention of the Court is invited to the order dated 21.07.2017\n\n(Annexure P-5) passed by National Company Law Tribunal, New Delhi (in\n\nshort &quot;NCLT&quot;) to contend that at the instance of Indusind Bank, the\n\n\n\n\n                               4 of 15\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">            ::: Downloaded on - 14-07-2019 01:26:48 :::</span>\n CRM-M-14537-2018 and other connected matters                   -5-\n\nproceedings for initiation of Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process\n\n(CIRP) commenced under the provisions of Insolvency and Bankruptcy\n\nCode, 2016 (for short &#x27;IBC 2016&#x27;) whereby the prohibitory order was passed\n\nin respect of the assets of the corporate debtor (accused No.1). It is also\n\npointed out that Sh.Vijender Sharma stood appointed as Interim Resolution\n\nProfessional. According to him, in these circumstances, the complaint\n\nbrought by respondent/complainant is not maintainable. It is also argued by\n\nthe learned counsel that the statutory notice dated 04.10.2017 (Annexure P-\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">3) was promptly responded to by the petitioner through reply dated\n\n16.10.2017 and the complaint itself acknowledged this fact, however, neither\n\nthe same was produced before the Court nor the trial Court desired to\n\nexamine it by directing the complainant to produce the same. The trial Court\n\nhas proceeded to pass the summoning order in a mechanical manner. It is\n\nprayed that the complaints and the proceedings deserve to be quashed.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_11\">            On the other hand, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the\n\nState contends that though the State has been arrayed as one of the\n\nrespondents, but the main contest lies between the respondent No.2\n\n(complainant) and the petitioner, whereas respondent No.3 is accused\n\nNo.1/company and therefore is proforma party.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">            The other respondent (complainant) has neither filed any reply\n\nto controvert the pleadings contained in the petition(s) nor has disputed the\n\nfact that the alleged notice dated 04.10.2017 was duly replied by the\n\npetitioner through his response dated 16.10.2017. On behalf of the\n\nrespondent No.2, it is argued that of course the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 138</a> NI\n\n\n\n\n                               5 of 15\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">            ::: Downloaded on - 14-07-2019 01:26:48 :::</span>\n CRM-M-14537-2018 and other connected matters                     -6-\n\nAct do contemplate that the penal provisions would be attracted in case the\n\ncheque in question is dishonoured on account of &quot;insufficient funds&quot; or &quot;the\n\namount exceeds the arrangement&quot;, but these provisions have been\n\ninterpreted on number of occasions by this Court as well as by the Hon&#x27;ble\n\nSupreme Court, wherein it was held that in cases where the account is\n\n&quot;closed&quot; or &quot;payment was stopped&quot; by drawer even then complaint under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 138</a> NI Act would be maintainable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_13\">             It is vehemently argued that on the same analogy, the complaint\n\nis maintainable as it is not disputed by the accused that the blocked account\n\nbelongs to it which resulted in dishonour of the cheques. According to the\n\nrespondent, the trial Court has passed the summoning order carefully after\n\nexamining the material on record and therefore, the petition deserves to be\n\ndismissed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">             At this stage, before adverting to the merits of this case, it\n\nwould be appropriate to have a glance at <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 138</a> NI Act which is\n\nextracted below:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">                    138 Dishonour of cheque for insufficiency, etc., of funds\n                    in the account. --Where any cheque drawn by a person\n                    on an account maintained by him with a banker for\n                    payment of any amount of money to another person from\n                    out of that account for the discharge, in whole or in part,\n                    of any debt or other liability, is returned by the bank\n                    unpaid, either because of the amount of money standing\n                    to the credit of that account is insufficient to honour the\n                    cheque or that it exceeds the amount arranged to be paid\n                    from that account by an agreement made with that bank,\n                    such person shall be deemed to have committed an\n                    offence and shall, without prejudice to any other\n                    provisions of this Act, be punished with imprisonment\n                    for 19 [a term which may be extended to two years], or\n                    with fine which may extend to twice the amount of the\n                    cheque, or with both: Provided that nothing contained in\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_15\">                                6 of 15\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">             ::: Downloaded on - 14-07-2019 01:26:48 :::</span>\n CRM-M-14537-2018 and other connected matters                    -7-\n\n                   this section shall apply unless--\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">                   (a) the cheque has been presented to the bank within a\n                   period of six months from the date on which it is drawn\n                   or within the period of its validity, whichever is earlier;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_17\">                   (b) the payee or the holder in due course of the cheque,\n                   as the case may be, makes a demand for the payment of\n                   the said amount of money by giving a notice in writing, to\n                   the drawer of the cheque, 20[within thirty days] of the\n                   receipt of information by him from the bank regarding\n                   the return of the cheque as unpaid; and\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_18\">                   (c) the drawer of such cheque fails to make the payment\n                   of the said amount of money to the payee or, as the case\n                   may be, to the holder in due course of the cheque, within\n                   fifteen days of the receipt of the said notice.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">            The above provision has been dealt with in detail by the Hon&#x27;ble\n\nSupreme Court on number of occasions.

Hence, the question is, in a case\n                          where cheque is returned by the bank unpaid on\n                          the ground that the account is closed, would it\n                          mean that cheque is returned as unpaid on the\n                          ground that the amount of money standing to the\n                          credit of that account is insufficient to honour the\n                          cheque. In our view, the answer would obviously\n                          be   in        the   affirmative   because     cheque   is\n                          dishonoured as the amount of money standing to\n                          the credit of that account was nil at the relevant\n                          time apart from it being closed. Closure of the\n                          account would be an eventuality after the entire\n                          amount in the account is withdrawn. It means that\n                          there was no amount in the credit of that account\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">                               8 of 15\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">            ::: Downloaded on - 14-07-2019 01:26:48 :::</span>\n CRM-M-14537-2018 and other connected matters                    -9-\n\n                           on the relevant date when the cheque was\n                           presented for honouring the same.

It is\n                   held that the presumption under <a href=\"/doc/268919/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 139</a> is attracted\n                   in such a case also. The authority shows that even when\n                   the cheuqe is dishonoured by reason of stop payment\n                   instructions by virtue of <a href=\"/doc/268919/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 139</a> the Court has to\n                   presume that the cheque was received by the holder for\n                   the discharge, in whole or in part, of any debt or liability.\n                   Of course this is a rebuttable presumption. The accused\n                   can thus show that the &quot;stop payment&quot; instructions were\n                   not issued because of insufficiency or paucity of funds. If\n                   the accused shows that in his account there was sufficient\n                   funds to clear the amount of the cheque at the time of\n                   presentation of the cheque for encashment at the drawer\n                   bank and that the stop payment notice had been issued\n                   because of other valid causes including that there was no\n                   existing debt or liability at the time of presentation of\n                   cheque for encashment, then an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_24\">Section\n                   138</a> would not be made out. The important thing is that\n                   the burden of so proving would be on the accused.

The dictionary\n\nmeaning of &quot;Maintain&quot; (as contained in Oxford Dictionary) is defined as:-\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">the act of making the state or situation continue. Therefore, the said\n\nexpression &quot;account maintained by him&quot; cannot be construed narrowly to\n\nmean that if the account belongs to the accused, the necessary ingredient\n\nwould be complete. This expression &quot;account maintained by him&quot; must\n\nnecessarily include that the said account is not only alive and operative, but\n\nthe account holder is capable of executing command to govern the financial\n\ntransactions which include the clearance of cheques etc. The authority and\n\ncontrol of the account holder upon the account must exist on the effective\n\ndate i.e. when the cheque becomes valid for presentation in the bank. It is\n\nsettled law that mere issuance of a cheque is not an offence, but it becomes\n\npunishable when the said cheque is dishonoured. Mere fact that the record of\n\nthe drawer bank shows a particular name as account holder would not be\n\nsufficient to establish that account is being maintained by the account\n\nholder, unless the said account holder holds the authority and control over\n\nthe said account. In other words, if an account holder is deprived off his\n\nauthority, control and dominion over the bank account, it cannot be said that\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_33\">                                11 of 15\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">             ::: Downloaded on - 14-07-2019 01:26:48 :::</span>\n CRM-M-14537-2018 and other connected matters                    -12-\n\nthe account is being maintained by the said account holder.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_34\">            Now while adverting to the facts of this case, it is evident that\n\nthe proceedings against the company were initiated under the provisions of\n\nIB Code 2016 and the order in terms of <a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 14</a> of IB Code was passed\n\non 21.07.2017.
