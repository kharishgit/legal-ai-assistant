The appellants had to file an application under \n<a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. because the Special Judicial Magistrate, \nRishikesh issued a non-bailable warrant against the \nappellants on the basis of First Information Report under \n<a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_4\">Sections 420</a>/<a href=\"/doc/1985627/\" id=\"a_5\">467</a> IPC filed by the respondents. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_4\">Basic Facts\n\tIn 1923, Pt. Madan Mohan Malviya founded Sanatan \nDharma Pratinidhi Sabha, Punjab (hereinafter referred as \u0013the \nSabha\u0014).   Some of the objects of the Sabha are to open and \nmaintain temples, dharamshalas, ashrams and to manage \nschools and colleges for the overall development of children. \nMoreover, it seeks to open hospitals for the poor and to \ndevelop the physical and mental state of the youth etc.  It is \naverred that the Sabha from its inception is engaged in the \nwork of uplifting backward and downtrodden people and is a \ngrass root organization in the field of social development.  The \nSabha was registered in the year 1949 under the <a href=\"/doc/1700055/\" id=\"a_6\">Societies \nRegistration Act</a>.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">\tIn order to develop a Ghat on the bank of river Ganga \nnear Sapatrishi Ashram in Hardwar, the Sabha issued an \nadvertisement in the newspapers; it invited bids from the \neligible civil contractors to construct the Ghat in consideration \nof 13.5 Bighas (approximately) of its land situated in old \nKhasra No.140 and new Khasra Nos.61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, \n67, 68 and part of 89, 90 in village Haripur Kalan, Rishikesh, \nDehradun out of the total land of 26 Bighas owned by the \nSabha.  The Ghat was so constructed by one Himmat Rai \nAhuja, respondent no.3 herein, on behalf of M/s Ahuja \nBuilders.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">     On completion of the construction of the Ghat, the Sabha \nthrough its President Pt. Mohan Lal Sharma executed a \nGeneral Power of Attorney on 13.12.1996 in favour of \nrespondent no.3 in regard to the abovementioned land \nmeasuring 13.5 Bighas (out of the total of 26 Bighas \napproximately).  On the same date, a receipt of Rs.17,92,000/- \nlakhs (approximately) was issued by the Sabha to respondent \nno.3 as an adjustment towards the cost of construction of the \nGhat for which the said land of 13.5 Bighas was transferred by \nexecuting a General Power of Attorney dated 13.12.1996 in \nfavour of respondent no. 3.  On the same day the parties \nexecuted an agreement to sell the remaining land situated at \nOld Khasra No.140 and new Khasra No.89 in Village Haripur \nKalan, Rishikesh at the rate of Rs.1,35,000/- per Bigha (which \nwas approx. 11.19 Bighas).  In pursuance to this, an earnest \nmoney of Rs.4,00,000/- was received by the Sabha from \nrespondent no.3.  As per the agreement, respondent no.3 had \nto pay another Rs.1,00,000/- to the Sabha by 31.1.1997.  This \namount was paid by respondent no.3 on 21.3.1997 and the \nbalance amount of Rs.10,10,650/- had to be paid by \n31.3.1997.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">\tAccording to the appellants, time was the essence of the \ncontract and respondent no.3 had failed to pay the balance \namount by Rs.10,10,650/-.  The Sabha had sent a legal notice \ndated 3.4.1999 (first legal notice) to respondent no.3 to fulfill \nhis contractual obligations under the sale agreement and \ninforming that if he failed to do so, the agreement to sell would \nstand cancelled and the amount paid as earnest money would \nbe forfeited.  In reply to the said notice, respondent no.3 vide \nhis reply dated 5.5.1999 stated that he had not defaulted in \npayment of the remaining amount.  He stated in the reply that \nas per the agreement the land had to be measured and that he \nwas ready to pay the balance amount once that was done.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">\tPt. Mohan Lal Sharma, the President of the Sabha, \nexpired on 30.8.1999.  On 5.1.2000, both the parties i.e. the \nrepresentative of the Sabha and the representatives of M/s \nAhuja Builders met at the site of the disputed land in the \npresence of Patwari (Revenue Official).  The land of old Khasra \nNo.140 and new Khasra Nos.61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68 and \npart of 89, 90 was measured by the Patwari.  The balance \nland, after adjusting the land given in lieu of construction of \nthe Ghat, came out to be 11.19 Bighas.  The total sale \nconsideration for this land worked out to be Rs.15,10,650/-.  \nRespondent no.3 had already paid Rs.4,00,000/- as earnest \nmoney out of this amount.  He had paid a further sum of \nRs.1,00,000/- on 21.3.1997.  On the request of respondent \nno.3, the Sabha reduced the amount owed of Rs.1,50,000/- to \nhim in view of the existence of a passage on the said land.  \nOut of the balance of Rs.8,60,650/-, a further concession of \nRs.60,650/- was given to Respondent no.3.  He thus had to \npay the balance amount of Rs.8,00,000/-.  The said \nmeasurement sheet was endorsed by respondent nos.3 and 4 \nand the representatives of the Sabha on 19.3.2000.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">\tThe General Power of Attorney executed by Late Mohan \nLal Sharma, President of the Sabha, had ceased to be in effect \nafter his death.  Therefore, the need of a fresh power of \nattorney was felt and respondent no.3 desired that the fresh \nPower of Attorney be executed in the name of his son, Suresh \nAhuja (respondent no.4 herein) for the very same 13.5 Bighas \nof land in regard to which earlier Power of Attorney dated \n13.12.1996 had been given.  Accordingly, General Secretary of \nthe Sabha, appellant no.1 herein, executed a fresh General \nPower of Attorney on 15.1.2000 in respect of 13.5 Bighas of \nland situated in part of Old Khasra No.140 (new Khasra Nos. \n61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68 and part of 89, 90) in Village \nHaripur Kalan, Rishikesh, Dehradun, in favour of Suresh \nAhuja (respondent no.4) as per the request of respondent no.3.\n\tAccording to the appellants, the Sabha made several \nrequests to respondent nos.3 and 4 asking them to pay the \nbalance amount of Rs.8,00,000/-.  However, despite repeated \nrequests, the respondents failed to do so.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\">\tThe appellants submitted that the Sabha had learnt from \nreliable sources and from the office of the Registrar of \nProperties that respondent no.3, by misrepresentation and by \nmisusing his General Power of Attorney for the 13.5 Bighas of \nland, was attempting to sell the entire 26 Bighas of the \nSabha\u0012s land to other parties and was executing sale deeds \nwithout any right whatsoever in respect of the remaining \n11.19 Bighas.  The appellants learnt that respondent no.4 had \nexecuted at least 29 registered sale deeds consisting of 13.5 \nBighas of land in favour of various parties.  The Sabha also \ndiscovered that 11.19 Bighas of land, for which there was only \nan agreement to sell between respondent no.3 and the Sabha, \nwas also sold by respondent no.4 to his father (respondent \nno.3 herein) by executing three registered sale deeds.  Such \nsales could not give any title to respondent no.3.  \n\tOn 30.4.2001, appellant no.1 sent a legal notice (second \nnotice) to respondent nos.3 and 4 informing them that if the \nbalance amount of Rs.8,00,000/- was not paid, he would have \nto cancel the General Power of Attorney.   No reply to the said \nnotice was received from the respondents nor was \nRs.8,00,000/- paid.  In these circumstances, appellant no. 1 \n(I. M. Goswami) cancelled the power of attorney issued in \nfavour of respondent no.4 and informed respondent no. 4 \naccordingly.  A public notice of the same was also published \nby the Sabha in a local newspaper \u0013Amar Ujala\u0014, a Hindi daily \non 25.10.2002.  The notice informed the general public about \nthe cancellation of the General Power of Attorney given to \nrespondent no.4.  According to the appellants, in order to \nprotect the interest of the Sabha, the remaining land of 11.19 \nBighas of Khasra No.140 was sold to one Sunil Kumar on  \u0013as \nis where is basis\u0014 on 18.12.2002.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\">\tHaving committed breach of his contractual obligations, \nrespondent no.3 filed a criminal complaint to the SHO of \nRaiwala, Rishikesh police station on 23.4.2003 against the \nappellants and three other persons alleging that he had been \ncheated by the appellants in connivance with other persons by \nselling a portion of his land to a third party and by cancelling \nthe General Power of Attorney.  After examining the matter, \nthe SHO arrived at the conclusion that no cognizable offence \nhad been committed and the dispute in question was of civil \nnature for which the civil remedy is available in law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_12\">\tRespondent no.3 filed another complaint on the same \nday, i.e. 23.4.2003, to the Senior Superintendent of Police, \nDehradun and got the FIR registered against the appellant and \nthree other persons.  The allegation of respondent no.3 was \nthat the appellants in connivance with other persons had sold \nthe part of land situated in Old Khasra No.140 and new \nKhasra No.89 which had been transferred to them by way of \nGeneral Power of Attorney.  The FIR was registered on \n23.4.2003 as Case No.26 of 2003 under <a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_7\">sections 420</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1985627/\" id=\"a_8\">467</a> and \n<a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_9\">120-B</a> IPC. \n</p>     \n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">     It may be pertinent to mention that on 27.5.2003, \nrespondent no.3 filed a civil suit in the court of Civil Judge \n(Senior Division) against the Sabha bearing Original Suit \nNo.302 of 2003 titled Himmat Rai Ahuja v. Sanatan \nDharam Pratinidhi Sabha.  In this suit, respondent no.3 \nprayed for cancellation of sale deed executed by the Sabha in \nfavour of Sunil Kumar and for permanent injunction against \nthe appellants herein restraining them from interfering in his \nalleged property.  Thus, the issues relating to ascertaining the \nright, title of the land in dispute and also the issue of correct \ndemarcation of land in Khasra No.140 are pending \nadjudication in a competent civil court.\n</p>     \n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_14\">     On the basis of the FIR registered, the case was \ninvestigated by the Sub-Inspector, Raiwala Police Station.  \nLater on the investigation was transferred to Rishikesh Police \nStation.  Thereafter, the investigation was again transferred to \nRaiwala Police Station and a charge-sheet was filed in the \nCourt of the Special Judicial Magistrate, Rishikesh.\n</p>     \n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_15\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"994047\" id=\"span_1\">Aggrieved by the filing of the false and incorrect charge-\nsheet in the court of Special Judicial Magistrate, Rishikesh in \nCriminal Case No.1728 of 2003 titled <a href=\"/doc/994047/\" id=\"a_10\">State v. Inder Mohan \nGoswami &amp; Others</a>, the appellants filed a Criminal \nMiscellaneous Application No.248 of 2003 in the High Court of \nUttaranchal at Nainital under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_11\">section 482</a> Cr.P.C. for quashing \nthe proceedings against them.  The High Court was pleased to \npass the interim order on 22.10.2003 staying further \nproceedings.  A reply was filed on behalf of the State by Shri \nDinesh Kumar Sharma, SHO, Raiwala Police Station, in which \ntwo points were raised:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">1.\tThat, appellant no.1 has wrongly cancelled the \nGeneral Power of Attorney given to respondent \nno.4; and\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">2.\tThat, appellant no.1 has wrongly and illegally \nexecuted the sale deed of land comprising in \n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">Khasra No.140 (new Khasra Nos.61 to 68, 89 </span>\nand 90) without returning the earnest money \nof respondent nos.3 and 4.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_16\">     The High Court by order dated 16.7.2004 dismissed the \npetition under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. filed by the appellants on \nthe ground that the records show that the allegations in the \nFIR constitute an offence as alleged by the complainant.  The \nsaid order is challenged in this appeal by special leave.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_17\">     The appellants submitted that first appellant cancelled \nthe power of attorney by a registered cancellation deed after \ninforming respondent no.4.  The cancellation was necessary to \nprotect its interests because respondent no.4 was selling the \nSabha\u0012s land by misusing the power of attorney. The Sabha \nsold the land to Sunil Kumar only after respondent nos.3 and \n4 failed to fulfill their obligations under the contract and had \nmala fide intention to grab the land without paying the \nbalance amount.  Accordingly, the sale deeds executed by \nrespondent no.4 in favour of respondent no.3 were illegal.  The \nappellants\u0012 cancelling the power of attorney and selling a part \nof the land to Sunil Kumar to protect the interests of the \nSabha by no stretch of the imagination attracts ingredients of \nthe offences of <a href=\"/doc/1985627/\" id=\"a_13\">sections 467</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_14\">420</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_15\">120B</a> IPC.    According to \nthe appellants, the entire issue relates to ascertaining the \nright, title of the land in dispute and also the issue of correct \ndemarcation of the land Khasra No.140, all of which are \npending adjudication before a competent civil court. The \nappellants contended that they filed a criminal miscellaneous \napplication under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_16\">section 482</a> Cr.P.C. for quashing the FIR \nbecause no offence under <a href=\"/doc/1985627/\" id=\"a_17\">sections 467</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_18\">420</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_19\">120B</a> of the \nI.P.C. could be made out.  The controversy between the parties \nis purely of a civil nature.   A civil suit has already been filed \nand is pending adjudication.  The appellants submitted that \nthe High Court gravely erred in dismissing the application \nunder <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_20\">section 482</a> Cr.P.C; whereas, according to the \nrespondents, the High Court was justified in declining to \nquash the FIR because of the conduct of the appellants.  In \nthe counter-affidavit, it was also alleged that the loss had not \nbeen suffered by the appellants but in fact it had been suffered \nby the respondents.\n</p>\t\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_18\">     The appellants in the rejoinder submitted that the trial \ncourt was not justified in taking cognizance of the matter \nwhen no prima facie case was made out against the \nappellants.  The trial court gravely erred in not appreciating \nthe complete facts of the case in the proper perspective. The \ntrial court has not properly comprehended the complete \ninvestigation reports, which were conducted by two different \ninvestigating officers.  It was pointed out that it was the \nrespondents who had committed criminal breach by \npurporting to sell that part of the land for which an agreement \nto sell was procured, by misusing the Power of Attorney given \nto them for some other part of the land.  Respondent no.4 was \nclearly guilty of offences under <a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_21\">sections 420</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1985627/\" id=\"a_22\">467</a> IPC and \nthe appellants had also filed a criminal complaint against \nrespondent nos.3 and 4 before the Special Judicial Magistrate, \nRishikesh under <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_23\">sections 120B</a>/<a href=\"/doc/1985627/\" id=\"a_24\">467</a>/<a href=\"/doc/556166/\" id=\"a_25\">468</a>/<a href=\"/doc/1466184/\" id=\"a_26\">471</a> IPC.  The \ncriminal case was registered as Case No.1306 of 2003 titled as \nI.M. Goswami v. Suresh Ahuja.  The Special Judicial \nMagistrate vide order dated 12th May, 2005 had issued \nsummons to respondent nos.3 and 4.  \n</p>     \n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_19\">     The appellants submitted that in the impugned \njudgment, the High Court had also disregarded the settled \nlegal position crystallized by various judgments of this court \nand declined to quash the criminal proceedings against the \nappellants.\n</p>   \n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_20\">     We have heard the learned counsel for the parties at \nlength.  The appellants who are office-bearers of a charitable \norganization, namely, Sanatan Dharma Pratinidhi Sabha, in \norder to protect the interests of the Sabha cancelled the Power \nof Attorney by executing a registered Cancellation Deed after \ngiving notice to the Power of Attorney holders.  The appellants \nsold only that part of the land to Sunil Kumar on behalf of the \nSabha for which an agreement to sell with the complainants \n(respondents) had already been terminated.  The respondent\u0012s \nearnest money had been forfeited.  All of this was only done \nafter appellants had given respondents due notice.  \n</p>\n\t\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">     The veracity of the facts alleged by the appellants and the \nrespondents can only be ascertained on the basis of evidence \nand documents by a civil court of competent jurisdiction.  The \ndispute in question is purely of civil nature and respondent \nno.3 has already instituted a civil suit in the court of Civil \nJudge.  In the facts and circumstances of this case, initiating \ncriminal proceedings by the respondents against the \nappellants is clearly an abuse of the process of the court.\nScope and ambit of courts\u0012 powers under section 482 \nCr.P.C.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_22\">     This court in a number of cases has laid down the scope \nand ambit of courts\u0012 powers under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_27\">section 482</a> Cr.P.C.  Every \nHigh Court has inherent power to act ex debito justitiae to do \nreal and substantial justice, for the administration of which \nalone it exists, or to prevent abuse of the process of the court.  \nInherent power under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_28\">section 482</a> Cr.P.C. can be exercised:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">(i)\tto give effect to an order under the Code; \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">(ii)\tto prevent abuse of the process of court, and \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">(iii)\tto otherwise secure the ends of justice. \n</blockquote>    \n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_23\">     Inherent powers under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_29\">section 482</a> Cr.P.C. though wide \nhave to be exercised sparingly, carefully and with great \ncaution and only when such exercise is justified by the tests \nspecifically laid down in this section itself.  Authority of the \ncourt exists for the advancement of justice.  If any abuse of the \nprocess leading to injustice is brought to the notice of the \ncourt, then the Court would be justified in preventing injustice \nby invoking inherent powers in absence of specific provisions \nin the Statute.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">Discussion of decided cases\n\n     Reference to the following cases would reveal that the \ncourts have consistently taken the view that they must use \nthis extraordinary power to prevent injustice and secure the \nends of justice.  The English courts have also used inherent \npower to achieve the same objective. It is generally agreed that \nthe Crown Court has inherent power to protect its process \nfrom abuse.  In Connelly v. DPP [1964] AC 1254, Lord Devlin \nstated that where particular criminal proceedings constitute \nan abuse of process, the court is empowered to refuse to allow \nthe indictment to proceed to trial.  Lord Salmon in DPP v. \nHumphrys [1977] AC 1 stressed the importance of the \ninherent power when he observed that it is only if the \nprosecution amounts to an abuse of the process of the court \nand is oppressive and vexatious that the judge has the power \nto intervene.  He further mentioned that the court\u0012s power to \nprevent such abuse is of great constitutional importance and \nshould be jealously preserved.  \n</p>     \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1033301\" id=\"span_3\">In <a href=\"/doc/1033301/\" id=\"a_30\">R.P. Kapur v. State of Punjab</a> AIR 1960 SC 866, this \ncourt summarized some categories of cases where inherent \npower can and should be exercised to quash the proceedings:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">(i)\twhere it manifestly appears that there is a \nlegal bar against the institution or continuance \nof the proceedings;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">(ii)\twhere the allegations in the first information \nreport or complaint taken at their face value \nand accepted in their entirety do not constitute \nthe offence alleged;\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">(iii)\twhere the allegations constitute an offence, \nbut there is no legal evidence adduced or the \nevidence adduced clearly or manifestly fails to \nprove the charge.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_26\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1033301\" id=\"span_4\">The powers possessed by the High Court under section \n482 of the Code are very wide and the very plenitude of the \npower requires great caution in its exercise.  The court must \nbe careful to see that its decision in exercise of this power is \nbased on sound principles.  The inherent power should not be \nexercised to stifle a legitimate prosecution.  The High Court \nshould normally refrain from giving a prima facie decision in a \ncase where all the facts are incomplete and hazy; more so, \nwhen the evidence has not been collected and produced before \nthe court and the issues involved, whether factual or legal, are \nof such magnitude that they cannot be seen in their true \nperspective without sufficient material.

The High Courts have been \ninvested with inherent powers, both in civil and criminal \nmatters, to achieve a salutary public purpose.   A court \nproceeding ought not to be permitted to degenerate into a \nweapon of harassment or persecution.

In the first class of \nacts he may be induced fraudulently or dishonestly to deliver \nproperty to any person. The second class of acts is the doing \nor omitting to do anything which the person deceived would \nnot do or omit to do if he were not so deceived.  In the first \nclass of cases, the inducing must be fraudulent or dishonest.  \nIn the second class of acts, the inducing must be intentional \nbut need not be fraudulent or dishonest.  Therefore, it is the \nintention which is the gist of the offence.  To hold a person \nguilty of cheating it is necessary to show that he had a \nfraudulent or dishonest intention at the time of making the \npromise.  From his mere failure to subsequently keep a \npromise, one cannot presume that he all along had a culpable \nintention to break the promise from the beginning.   \n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_36\">     We shall now deal with the ingredients of <a href=\"/doc/1985627/\" id=\"a_57\">section 467</a> \nIPC.  <a href=\"/doc/1985627/\" id=\"a_58\">Section 467</a> IPC reads as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">\u0013467.

Inherent jurisdiction of the High Courts under \n<a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_63\">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. though wide has to be exercised sparingly, \ncarefully and with caution and only when it is justified by the \ntests specifically <a href=\"/doc/1033637/\" id=\"a_64\">laid down in</a> the Statute itself and in the \naforementioned cases.

It has come to \nour notice that in many cases that bailable and non-bailable \nwarrants are issued casually and mechanically. In the instant \ncase, the court without properly comprehending the nature of \ncontroversy involved and without exhausting the available \nremedies issued non-bailable warrants.  The trial court \ndisregarded the settled legal position clearly enumerated in the \nfollowing two cases.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\">     In Omwati v.State of UP &amp; Another (2004) 4 SCC 425, \nthis court dealt with a rather unusual matter wherein the High \nCourt firstly issued bailable warrants against the appellant  \nand thereafter by issuing non-bailable warrants put the \ncomplainant of the case behind bars without going through \nthe facts of the case.  This Court observed that the \nunfortunate sequel of such unmindful orders has been that \nthe appellant was taken into custody and had to remain in jail \nfor a few days, but without any justification whatsoever.  She \nsuffered because facts of the case were not considered in \nproper perspective before passing the orders.  The court also \nobserved that some degree of care is supposed to be taken \nbefore issuing warrants. \n</p>     \n       \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"841465\" id=\"span_15\">In <a href=\"/doc/841465/\" id=\"a_65\">State of U.P. v.

Although, the discretion \nis exercised judiciously, it is not possible to \ncomputerize and reduce into immutable formulae \nthe diverse considerations on the basis of which this \ndiscretion is exercised.  Broadly speaking, the court \nwould take into account the various factors such as \nthe nature and seriousness of the offence, the \ncharacter of the evidence, circumstances peculiar to \nthe accused, possibility of his absconding, larger \ninterest of the public and the State.  \n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">Personal liberty and the interest of the State\n\n\tCivilized countries have recognized that liberty is the \nmost precious of all the human rights.  The American \nDeclaration of Independence 1776, French Declaration of the \nRights of Men and the Citizen 1789, Universal Declaration of \nHuman Rights and the International Covenant of Civil and \nPolitical Rights 1966 all speak with one voice - liberty is the \nnatural and inalienable right of every human being.  Similarly, \n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_66\">Article 21</a> of our Constitution proclaims that no one shall be \ndeprived of his liberty except in accordance with the procedure \nprescribed by law.  \n</blockquote>\t\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">     The issuance of non-bailable warrants involves \ninterference with personal liberty.  Arrest and imprisonment \nmeans deprivation of the most precious right of an individual.  \nTherefore, the courts have to be extremely careful before \nissuing non-bailable warrants.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">\tJust as liberty is precious for an individual so is the \ninterest of the society in maintaining law and order.  Both are \nextremely important for the survival of a civilized society.  \nSometimes in the larger interest of the Public and the State it \nbecomes absolutely imperative to curtail freedom of an \nindividual for a certain period, only then the non-bailable \nwarrants should be issued.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">When non-bailable warrants should be issued  \n\n\tNon-bailable warrant should be issued to bring a person \nto court when summons of bailable warrants would be \nunlikely to have the desired result.  This could be when:  \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">*\tit is reasonable to believe that the person \nwill not voluntarily appear in court; or\n*\tthe police authorities are unable to find \nthe person to serve him with a summon; \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">or\n*\tit is considered that the person could \nharm someone if not placed into custody \nimmediately.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">     As far as possible, if the court is of the opinion that a \nsummon will suffice in getting the appearance of the accused \nin the court, the summon or the bailable warrants should be \npreferred.  The warrants either bailable or non-bailable should \nnever be issued without proper scrutiny of facts and complete \napplication of mind, due to the extremely serious \nconsequences and ramifications which ensue on issuance of \nwarrants.  The court must very carefully examine whether the \nCriminal Complaint or FIR has not been filed with an oblique \nmotive.\n</blockquote>\t\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">     In complaint cases, at the first instance, the court should \ndirect serving of the summons along with the copy of the \ncomplaint.  If the accused seem to be avoiding the summons, \nthe court, in the second instance should issue bailable-\nwarrant.  In the third instance, when the court is fully \nsatisfied that the accused is avoiding the court\u0012s proceeding \nintentionally, the process of issuance of the non-bailable \nwarrant should be resorted to.   Personal liberty is paramount, \ntherefore, we caution courts at the first and second instance to \nrefrain from issuing non-bailable warrants.\n</blockquote>\t\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">     The power being discretionary must be exercised \njudiciously with extreme care and caution.  The court should \nproperly balance both personal liberty and societal interest \nbefore issuing warrants.  There cannot be any straight-jacket \nformula for issuance of warrants but as a general rule, unless \nan accused is charged with the commission of an offence of a \nheinous crime and it is feared that he is likely to tamper or \ndestroy the evidence or is likely to evade the process of law, \nissuance of non-bailable warrants should be avoided.\n</blockquote>     \n     \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">     The Court should try to maintain proper balance between \nindividual liberty and the interest of the public and the State \nwhile issuing non-bailable warrant.\n</blockquote>     \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">     On consideration of the totality of facts and \ncircumstances of this case, the impugned judgment and order \nof the High Court cannot be sustained.\n</blockquote>     \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">     Needless to mention that the concerned civil court (where \nthe suit is pending) shall decide the suit without being \ninfluenced by any observation made by us in this judgment \nregarding the merits of the civil suit.\n</blockquote>     \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">\tReverting to the facts of this case, we are of the \nconsidered view that the impugned judgment of the High \nCourt in declining to exercise its inherent power has led to \ngrave miscarriage of justice.  Consequently, we set aside the \nimpugned judgment and in order to prevent abuse of the \nprocess of the court and to otherwise secure the ends of the \njustice we direct that all the proceedings emanating from the \nFIR shall stand quashed.  The appeal is disposed of \naccordingly.  In the facts and circumstances of this case, we \ndirect the parties to bear their own costs.\n</blockquote>",
