The only question before the Court is as to when and\nwhy shall capital punishment be pronounced on a murderer and\nwhy not\t in other  cases, within  the confines\tof the Code.\nUrgency to  the solution  is obvious.  The overt ambivalence\nand covert conflict among judges concerning continued resort\nto  the\t  death\t sentence   mirrors  the  uncertainties\t and\nconflicts of values in the community itself. [89G &amp; 90D]\n2. <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_1\">Section  302</a> of  the IPC  throws little light on when the\ncourt shall  be the sentence of why the lesser penalty shall\nbe preferred.  Since law  reflects life,  new meanings\tmust\npermeate the  Penal Code.  Deprivation\tof  life  under\t our\nsystem is  too fundamental  to be  permitted except  on\t the\ngravest ground\tand under the strictest scrutiny. [90F: 94C-\nD]\n     3. To  say that  discretion of  the Judge\tpassing\t the\nsentence under<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_2\">\ts. 302</a>\tIPC  is\t guided\t by  well-recognised\nprinciples shifts  the issue  to what those recognised rules\nare. The  big margin  of, subjectivism. a preference for old\nprecedents, theories of modern penology, behavioral emphasis\nor social  antecedents,\t judicial  hubris  or  human  rights\nperspectives, reverence for outworn social philosophers-this\nplurality of  forces plays a part in swining the pendulum of\nsentencing justice  erratically.  Until\t Parliament  speaks,\nthis Court cannot be silent. [95; 97G]\n     4. Executive  commutation is no substitute for judicial\njustice, at  best it  is administrative\t policy and at worst\npressure-based partiality.  The criteria  for  clemency\t are\noften different [99C]\n     5. In  so far  as<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_3\">\ts.  302</a>\t IPC  is  concerned  several\nattempts had  been made\t to restrict or remove death penalty\nbut never to enlarge its application. Parliamentary pressure\nhas been  to cut  down death  penalty, although\t the section\nformally remains  the same.  In the  case  of  the  <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_4\">Criminal\nProcedure Code</a>\tthe legislative\t development has shifted the\npunitive  centre   of  gravity\tfrom  life  taking  to\tlife\nsentence. In  other words, the legislative trend seems to be\nwhile formerly\tthe rule  was to  sentence to death a person\nwho is\tconvicted for  murder, it  is now to impose a lesser\nsentence for  reasons to  be recorded  in writing. Formerly,\ncapital punishment  was to be imposed unless special reasons\ncould be  found to  justify the\t lesser sentence. After 1955\ncourts were  left equally free to award either sentence. The\n1973 Code  has made  an an  mistakable shift  in legislative\nemphasise under\t which life  imprisonment for  murder is the\nrule and  capital sentence  the exception  for reasons to be\nstated. [101D:104B-C]\n79\n     6. Criminologists\tall the\t world over, however, argued\nthat death  has decisively  lost the battle, and even in our\nCodes it  has shrunk  into a  weak exception.  What are\t the\nexceptional cases ? Personal story of an actor in a shocking\nmurder, if  considered,\t may  bring  tears  and\t soften\t the\nsentence. He  might have  been a  tortured  child,  an\till-\ntreated orphan, a jobless man or the convict&#x27;s poverty might\nbe responsible for the crime. [106G: 107B]\n     7. In  the post  Constitution period  s. 302 <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_5\">IPC</a> and<a href=\"/doc/1814951/\" id=\"a_6\"> s.\n345(3)</a> of  the Cr.  P.C. have to be read in the humane light\nof Parts  III and  IV  illumined  by  the  Preamble  to\t the\nConstitution.  In  other  words\t the  sacrifice\t of  a\tlife\nsentence is sanctioned only if otherwise public interest and\nsocial\tdefence\t  and  public\torder\twould\tbe   smashed\nirretrievably.\t  Such\t   extraordinary    grounds    alone\nconstitutionally qualify  as special  reasons. One stroke of\nmurder\thardly\t qualifies  for\t this  drastic\trequirement,\nhowever gruesome  the killing may be. The searching question\nthe Judge  must put to himself is what is so-extra-ordinari-\nly reasonable  as to  validate the wiping out of life itself\nand with  it the  great rights\twhich inhere  in him  in the\ntotality of facts. [121F; 110E-F]\n     8. The  retributive theory\t has had  its day  and is no\nlonger valid.  Deterrence and  reformation are\tthe  primary\nsocial goals  which make  deprivation of  life\tand  liberty\nreasonable as penal penacea. [122C]\n     9. The current ethos, with its strong emphasis on human\nrights and  against death penalty, together with the ancient\nstrains of culture spanning the period from Buddha to Gandhi\nmust ethically inform the concept of social justice which is\na  paramount   principle  and\tcultural  paradigm   of\t our\nConstitution [l22C-D]\n     10. The  personal\tand  social,  the  motivational\t and\nphysical circumstances, of the criminal are relevant factors\nin adjudging  the penalty  as clearly provided for under the\nCode of\t 1973. So also the intense suffering already endured\nby prison  torture or  agonishing death penalty hanging over\nhead consequent on the legal process. [112D-El\n     11. Although the somewhat obsolescent Mc&#x27;Naughten Rules\ncodified in  s. 84  of the Penal Code alone are exculpatory,\nmental imbalances, neurotic upsets and psychic crises may be\nextenuatory and\t the sense  of diminished responsibility may\nmanifest itself in judicial clemency of commuted life incar-\nceration. [l22F]\n     12. The  social justice  which the Preamble and Part IV\n(<a href=\"/doc/1673816/\" id=\"a_7\">Art. 38</a>)  highlight, as  paramount in the governance of the\ncountry has  a role  to mould the sentence. If the murderous\noperation of a die-hard criminal jeopardizes social security\nin a  persistent, planned  and\tperilous  fashion  then\t his\nenjoyment of  fundamental rights may be rightly annihilated.\nOne test  for imposition  of death  sentence is\t to find out\nwhether the  murderer offers  such a traumatic threat to the\nsurvival of  social order.  Some of the principles are-never\nhang unless  society or\t its members  may lose more lives by\nkeeping alive  an  irredeemable\t convict.  Therefore  social\njustice\t projected   by\t <a href=\"/doc/1673816/\" id=\"a_8\">Art.  38</a>  colours  the\t concept  of\nreasonableness in  <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_9\">Art. 19</a> and non-arbitrariness in <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_10\">Art. 14.</a>\nThis complex  of articles validates death penalty in limited\ncases. Maybe train dacoity and bank robbery bandits reaching\nmenacing proportions,  economic offenders  profit killing in\nan intentional\tand organised  way, are such categories in a\nThird World setting. [112D: 114C: 112G]\n80\n     13. Survival  of an  orderly society  without which the\nextinction of  human rights  is a  probability\tcompels\t the\nhigher protection  of the  law to  those  officers  who\t are\ncharged with  the fearless  and risky discharge of hazardous\nduties in  strategic situations. Those officers of law, like\npolicemen on  duty or  soldiers and the like have to perform\ntheir functions\t even in  the face  of threat  of  violence,\nsometimes in  conditions of  great  handicap.  If  they\t are\nkilled by  designers of\t murder and the law does not express\nits strong  condemnation in extreme penalisation, justice to\nthose called  upon to defend justice may fail. This facet of\nsocial justice\talso may  in certain  circumstances  and  at\ncertain stages\tof  societal  life  demand  death  sentence.\n[123D-E]\n     14.  Special   reasons  necessary\tfor  imposing  death\npenalty must  relate not  to the  crime as  such but  to the\ncriminal. [124E]\n     Jagmohan Singh v. State of U.P., [1973] 1 SCC 20; Ediga\nAnnama v.  State of  A.P., [1974] 4 SCC, 443; Sunil Batra v.\nDelhi Admn., [1978] 4 SCC 494 at 569 &amp; 572; referred to.\n     Capital punishment\t in India;  The Impact\tof the Ediga\nAnamma, by Prof. A. R. Blackshield-(July 1977), referred to.\n     Rajendra Prasad&#x27;s case:\n     The family\t to which  the appellant  and  the  deceased\nbelonged were  on inimical  terms. The appellant who was the\nson of\tone of\tthe families  murder ed\t the deceased. After\nsome years  in the prison, he was released on Gandhi Jayanti\nday. On\t return some  minor incident ignited his latent feud\nand he\tstabbed to death a friend of the opposite family, he\nwas sentenced to death.\n     The second\t murder is  not to  be confounded  with\t the\npersistent potential  for murderous attacks by the murderer.\nThis was  not-a menace\tto the\tsocial order  but a specific\nfamily feud.  Here was\tnot a  youth of controllable violent\npropensities against  the community  but one  whose paranoid\npreoccupation with  a family  quarrel goaded  him to  go the\nrival. So  long as the therapeutic processes are absent from\nprisons these  institutions, for from being the healing hope\nof society,  prove  hardening  schools\tto  train  desperate\ncriminals. Desperate criminal is a convenient description to\nbrand a\t person. Seldom\t is the\t other\tside  of  the  story\nexposed to  judicial view.  There is  nothing on  record  to\nsuggest that the appellant was beyond redemption; nothing on\nrecord hints  at any  such attempt  inside the\tprison.\t The\nappellant  showed   no\tincurable   disposition\t to  violent\noutbursts against  his fellow-men.  There is  therefore,  no\nspecial reason\tto hang\t him.  He  should  be  awarded\tlife\nimprisonment.\nKunjukunju&#x27;s case:\n     The  appellant,   a  married  man\twith  two  children,\ndeveloped illicit  sex relations with a fresh girl. In order\nto win her hand he murdered his wife and two children. There\nis no  evidence to  show that he was a desperate hedonist or\nrandy rapist.  He is  not a  social security risk altogether\nbeyond salvage\tby therapeutic life sentence. Death sentence\nis commuted to life imprisonment.\nDubey&#x27;s case:\nThe appellant,\ta young man, aged about 20, stabbed to death\nthree members  of the  family with  whom his  family  had  a\nquarrel over partition of\n81\nproperty. It  is illegal  in  this  case  to  award  capital\nsentence  without   considering\t correctional  possibilities\ninside prison.\tHe was\tnot a  murderer born but made by the\npassion of  family quarrel.  He could  be saved\t for society\nwith correctional techniques and directed into repentance. A\nfamily feud,  an altercation,  a  sudden  passion,  although\nattended with  extraordinary cruelty,  young  and  malleable\nage, reasonable\t prospect of  reformation and absence of any\nconclusive circumstance\t that the  assailant is\t a  habitual\nmurderer or  given to  chronic\tviolence-these\tcatenate  of\ncircumstances bearing  on the  offender call  fol the lesser\nsentence.\nSen l. (Dissenting)\n     1. (a) It is constitutionally and legally impermissible\nfor the\t Supreme Court\twhile hearing  an appeal  by special\nleave under  <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_11\">Art. 136</a>  of the Constitution, on a question of\nsentence, to  restructure<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_12\"> s. 302</a> of the Indian Penal   Code,\n1860 or<a href=\"/doc/203036/\" id=\"a_13\"> s. 354</a>, sub-s. (3) of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_14\">Code of Criminal Procedure</a>\n1973, so  as to\t limit the  scope of  the sentence  of death\nprovided for the offence of murder under<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_15\"> s. 302</a>. [131F-G]\n     (b)  The  question\t whether  the  scope  of  the  death\nsentence  should  be  curtailed\t or  not,  is  one  for\t the\nParliament to decide. The matter is essentially of political\nexpediency and, as such, it is the concern of statesmen and,\ntherefore, properly  the domain\t of the legislature, not the\njudiciary. [137E]\n     (c) In an appeal confined to sentence under <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_16\">Article 136</a>\nof the\tConstitution, Supreme  Court has  not only the power\nbut as\twell as\t the duty  to interfere if it considers that\nthe appellant should be sentenced &#x27;differently&#x27;, that is, to\nset aside  the sentence of death and substitute in its place\nthe sentence  of imprisonment  for life, where it considers,\ntaking the  case as  a whole,  the sentence  of death  to be\nerroneous, excessive  or indicative  of an improper exercise\nof discretion;\tbut at\tthe same time, the Court must impose\nsome limitations  on itself  in the  exercise of  this broad\npower. In  dealing with\t a sentence  which has been made the\nsubject of  an appeal,\tthe  Court  will  interfere  with  a\nsentence only  where it\t is &#x27;erroneous\tin  principle&#x27;.\t The\nquestion, therefore,  in each  case is\twhether there  is an\n&#x27;error of principle&#x27; volved.[134G-Hl\n     (d)  The  Court  has  the\tduty  to  see  that  on\t the\nparticular  facts   and\t circumstances\t of  each  case\t the\npunishment fits\t the crime. Mere compassionate sentiments of\na humane  feelings cannot  be a\t sufficient reason  for\t not\nconfirming a  sentence of  death  but  altering\t it  into  a\nsentence of imprisonment for life. In awarding sentence, the\nCourt must,  as it should, concern itself with justice, that\nis, with unswerving obedience to established law. It is, and\nmust be,  also concerned  with the  probable effect  of\t its\nsentence both  on the general public and the culprit. Judges\nare  not   concerned  with   the  morales  or  ethics  of  a\npunishment. It is but their duty to administer the law as it\nis and not to say what it should be. It is not the intention\nof the\tSupreme Court  to curtail  the scope  of  the  death\nsentence` under<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_17\"> s. 302</a> by a process of judicial construction\ninspired by the personal views [35B: 137D-E]\n     2. It  is also-not\t legally permissible  for this Court\nwhile hearing an appeal in a particular case where a capital\nsentence is  imposed,  to  define  the\texpression  &quot;Special\nreasons&quot; occurring  in sub-s.  (3) of<a href=\"/doc/203036/\" id=\"a_18\"> s. 354</a> of the Code, in\nsuch\n82\nJUDGMENT:</pre>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_1\">virtually has  the effect  of abolishing the death sentence.\n[137H]\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_2\">     (a) Under<a href=\"/doc/203036/\" id=\"a_19\">\ts. 354</a>,\t sub-s. (3)  of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_20\">Code of Criminal\nProcedure</a>, 1973,  the Court is required to state the reasons\nfor a  sentence awarded,  and in the case of imposition of a\nsentence of  death the Judge has to record &quot;special reasons&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">for imposing death sentence. Punishment for murder as a rule\nshould be  life imprisonment  and death\t sentence is only an\nexception. [l59A]\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">     (b) It  is neither feasible nor legally permissible for\nthis Court  to give a definite connotation to the expression\n&quot;special reasons&quot; occurring in<a href=\"/doc/203036/\" id=\"a_21\"> s. 354</a> sub-s. (3) of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_22\">Code\nof Criminal Procedure</a>, 1973. It is difficult to put &quot;special\nreasons&quot; in  a straight-jacket. Each case must depend on its\nown particular\tfacts. The question of sentence must be left\nto the\tdiscretion of the Sessions Judge trying the accused.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_3\">Under the  present Code,  a trial for murder is divided into\ntwo stages.  There is  a bifurcated trial. The first part of\nthe trial  is directed\tsolely to  the\tissue  of  guilt  or\ninnocence, and\tconcludes with\tthe finding  of the Sessions\nJudge on  that issue.  At the end of the trial when he comes\nto a  conclusion of  guilt, he\thas to\tadjourn the case for\nhearing the accused on the question of sentence. [159C-D]\n     <a href=\"/doc/1986933/\" id=\"a_23\">Section  235</a>,  sub-s.  (2)\t of  the  Code\tspecifically\nprovides for an opportunity of hearing to the accused on the\nquestion of  sentence after  a verdict\tof guilt is recorded\nagainst him.  The burden is upon the prosecution to make out\na case\tfor imposition\tof  the\t extreme  penalty.  Where  a\nsentence of  death is passed, the Sessions Judge has to make\na reference  to the  High Court\t under<a href=\"/doc/796352/\" id=\"a_24\"> s. 366</a>, sub-s. (1) of\nthe Code.  Under<a href=\"/doc/1324577/\" id=\"a_25\"> s. 367</a>, sub-s. (1) if the High court thinks\na  further  inquiry  should  be\t made  into,  or  additional\nevedence taken\tupon, any  point bearing  upon the  guilt or\ninnocence of  the convicted person, it may make such inquiry\nor take\t such evidence\titself, or  direct it  to be made or\ntaken by the Court of Sessions. In a case submitted under<a href=\"/doc/796352/\" id=\"a_26\"> s.\n366</a>, the  High Court  under<a href=\"/doc/1629021/\" id=\"a_27\"> s. 368(a)</a> may either confirm the\nsentence, or  pass  any\t other\tsentence,  i.e.\t reduce\t the\nsentence of  death into a sentence of imprisonment for life.\nthereafter an  appeal lies  to this Court by a special leave\nunder <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_28\">Article 136</a> on the question of sentence. [159E-H]\n     Failing the  appeal, there\t is the President&#x27;s power to\ngrant reprieve\tand pardon  under <a href=\"/doc/553757/\" id=\"a_29\">Article 72 (1)</a>, as well as\nthe Governor&#x27;s power of commutation under <a href=\"/doc/873751/\" id=\"a_30\">Article 161</a> of the\nConstitution which is a sovereign function. The power of the\nPresident and of the Governor to grant reprieves and pardons\nis wide\t enough to include the power to commute and to remit\nsentence of  punishment. All cases of capital punishment are\nclosely scrutinised  by the  Executive at both the levels to\nsee whether  there are\tsuch  extenuating  circumstances  as\nwould justify  a reprieve,  and the power to commute a death\nsentence is  freely exercised,\twhenever there is some doubt\nas to  the severity  of the  punishment. Under\tthe  present\nsystem the  Prerogative of  Mercy in  the case\t, of persons\nunder sentence\tof death  works well and it produces results\ngene rally  regarded as satisfactory. It helps in mitigating\nthe rigour  of the  death sentence,  particularly in case of\nthose murderers\t whose execution  would\t offend\t the  public\nconscience. Very  few persons  under a sentence of death-may\nbe one or two in a year, in a State are usually executed. It\nis, therefore,\tnot proper  for the Court to trench upon the\nPresident&#x27;s or\tthe Governor&#x27;s perogative to grant pardon or\nreprieve under <a href=\"/doc/553757/\" id=\"a_31\">Articles 72(1)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/873751/\" id=\"a_32\">161</a> in taking\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">83</span>\nupon itself  the task  of commutation  of a  death sentence,\nwhich is properly imposed, in the facts and circumstances of\na particular  case, merely because there is a doubt that the\nExecutive may  commute the  sentence ultimately, or by one&#x27;s\nviews as to the utility of death penalty.

It  is only\tin very\t grave cases  where it\tis a\ncrime against  the society  and the  brutality of  the crime\nshocks the judicial conscience that the Court has the power,\nas well\t as the\t duty, to impose the death sentence. In view\nof these adequate safeguards, it can hardly be asserted that\nthe sentence  of death\tprovided for  an offence  of  murder\npunishable under  s. 302,  is &#x27;dehumanizing&#x27;  or that  it is\n&#x27;unnecessary&#x27;.

Punishment must  be designed  so  as  to\ndeter,\tas  far\t as  possible  from  commission\t of  similar\noffences. It should also serve as a warning to other members\nof society.  In both respects, the experiment of reformation\nhas  miserably\t failed.  There\t  is  no   doubt,  with\t the\ncommutation of his death sentence, the accused will commit a\nfew more  murders and  he would again become a menace to the\ncommunity.

The Court has to take into\nconsideration all  the circumstances  which do not merit the\nextreme penalty.  In the  facts and  circumstances  of\tthis\nparticular case\t i.e. Sheo  Shanker  .\tDubey&#x27;s\t case  these\nfactors cannot outweigh other considerations. Three precious\nlives have  been lost by the dastardly act of the accused. A\nfamily has  ` been wiped off.

Unfortunately our\npenal laws  do not  provide for\t death sentence\t for  either\nwhite collar  crimes or\t anti-social  offences.\t As  regards\n&#x27;hardened&#x27; murderers,  there  are  few\tto  be\tfound.\tMany\nmurders\t unfortunately\tgo  undetected\tand  many  a  brutal\nmurderer has  to be  acquitted for  want of  legal  evidence\nbringing his  guilt beyond  reasonable doubt.  Nevertheless,\nwhen the  guilt is  proved, the Court should leave aside all\nhumanitarian considerations if the extreme penalty is called\nfor. A &#x27;professional&#x27; murderer must, as matter of course, be\nsentenced to  death because  he is  menace to  the  society.\nWhatever sympathy  the Court can have should be reserved for\nthe victims  of the  crime rather than for the perpatrators.\nIn such\t cases, the law must take its course.

Its\t immediately\napparent features,  the obvious damage to person or property\nor to public security, are symptoms of a deeper disorder. It\nbetokens, and  it fosters,  an attitude\t in man\t to man,  of\nreckless selfishness, decit or malice, which is incompatible\nin the long run with any decent social life. In any advanced\nsociety it  is, in  part at  least, on account of this wider\ncharacter, less\t easily discerned,  that the  graver offence\nare Punished. [l43E-F]\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">     (a)   All\t  punishment\tproperly    implies    moral\naccountability. It  is related\tto injury  and not  only  to\ndamage or danger however greater. Capital punishment does so\nin an  eminent degree. It is directed against one who is ex-\nhypothesi an  inhuman brute,  i.e. it  is imposed  simply to\neliminate who  is held\tto  have  become  irretrievably,  a.\nIiability or a menace to society. [142E]\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">     (b) Punishment  like crime\t has a\tdual character.\t The\npenalty which  the convicted  murderer incurs  is not simply\ndeath, but  death in disgrace and death as a disgrace. In so\nfar as\tcapital punishment  is a threat, the threat consists\nnot only  in death  but in  infamy. Any theory which ignores\nthis characteristic is certainly defective.

(a)  The capital punishment controversy falls within\nthe strict limits of &#x27;independent&#x27; parliamentary law-making,\nand is\ta typical  or representative of the kind of problems\nthat leaders  of Parliament  face every\t day. In  short, the\ncase for  abolition of\tthe death sentence is political, not\nconstitutional, The Government carries the responsibility of\nlaw and\t order. That  is the  first` and fundamental duty of\nany Government.\t The Executive\thas the duty of advising the\nGovernment  of\tthe  laws  it  believes\t necessary  for\t the\nnational wellbeing.  It is  the duty of the Court, including\nthis Court, to administer the laws as they are. [l57D-E]\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_24\">     (b) Analysing  the substantive  merits of the cases for\nand against  the death\tpenalty for  murder is essentially a\nquestion for  the Parliament  to resolve  and  not  for\t the\nSupreme Court  to decide.  Therefore, it would not be proper\nfor the Judges to attempt to project their personal views in\na matter  which lies  in the  realm of\tpolitical  decision-\nmaking, by  focussing on  a single controversy, the question\nof the proper penalty for the crime of murder. [157B]\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_25\">     (c) Any  justification for the capital sentence, as for\nother salient features of the penal system must be sought in\nthe protection of the society and that alone. [145E]\n     Even where\t it has\t been legally retained, as in India,\nCapital Punishment  is now  seldom employed  except in\tvery\ngrave cases  where it is a crime against the society and the\nbrutality of  the  crime  shocks  the  judicial\t conscience.\nIndeed the death penalty satisfies the society&#x27;s retributive\ngoals and  is still  presumed to be a deterrent to potential\noffenders  Of\tthe  three  purposes  commonly\tassigned  to\npunishment-retribution,\t   deterrence\t and\treformation-\ndeterrence is  generally held  to  be  the  most  important,\nalthough the continuing public demand for retribution cannot\nbe ignored.  Prima facie,  the death  sentence is  likely to\nhave a\tstronger affect\t as a  deterrent upon  normal  human\nbeings\tthan  any  other  form\tof  punishment.\t People\t are\nbelieved to refrain from crime because they fear punishment.\nSince people  fear death  more than anything else, the death\npenalty is the most effective deterrent. [146C-E]\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_26\">     (d) If  the appeal of capital punishment were merely to\nfear of\t death, it  would be a very inefficient protector of\nsociety. In  civilised society and in peace time, government\nrelies for  obedience more  on its  moral prestige  than  on\nviolent repression  of crime.  Punishment only protects life\neffectively if\tit produces  in possible-murderers, not only\nfear  of  the  consequences  of\t committing  murder,  but  a\nhorrified recoil  for the  thing itself It can only achieve,\nthis, more  ambitious, task, if sentence of death is felt to\nembody\tsociety&#x27;s   strongest  condemnation  of\t murder\t and\nkeenest sense  of its  intolerable wickedness.\tIt is not by\nthe fear  of death  but\t by  exciting  in  the\tcommunity  a\nsentiment of  horror against  any particular  act, that\t the\noffenders could be deterred from committing it.

To\nillustrate, if\tan economic offender who intentionally mixes\npoison in  drugs  professionally  or  willfully\t adulterates\nintoxicating  substances   injuriously,\t and   knowingly  or\nintentionally causes  death for\t the sake of private profit,\nsuch trader  in\t lethal\t business  is  a  menace  to  social\nsecurity and  is, therefore,  a violator  of social  justice\nwhose extinction  becomes necessary  for society&#x27;s survival.\nSupposing a  murderous band  of armed dacoits inteintionally\nderails\t a   train  and\t large\tnumber\toff  people  die  in\nconsequence, if\t the ingredients  of murder  are present and\nthe object  is to  commit robbery  inside  the\ttrain,\tthey\npractise social\t injustice and\timperil social security to a\ndegree that  death penalty  becomes a necessity if the crime\nis proved  beyond doubt. There may be marginal exceptions or\nspecial extenuations  but none where this kind of dacoity or\nrobbery\t coupled   with\t murder\t  becomes  a  contagion\t and\noccupation, and\t social security  is so\t gravely  imperilled\nthat the fundamental rights of the defendant become a deadly\ninstrument whereby  many are  wiped out\t and terror  strikes\ncommunity  life.   Then\t he   &#x27;reasonably&#x27;   forefeits\t his\nfundamental rights  and takes  leave of\t life under the law.\nThe style of violence and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">113</span>\nsystematic  corruption\tand  deliberately  planned  economic\noffences by\t corporate top echelons are often a terrible\ntechnology of  knowingly causing  death on  a macro scale to\nmake a\tflood of profit. The definition of murder will often\napply to them. But because of corporate power such murderous\ndepradations are  not charged.\tIf prosecuted  and convicted\nfor murder, they may earn the extreme penalty for taking the\nlives of  innocents deliberately  for astronomical scales of\ngain.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_121\">     Likewise, if  a man  is a\tmurderer,  so  hardened,  so\nblood-thristy, that  within the prison and without, he makes\nno bones  about killing\t others or  carries on\ta prosperous\nbusiness in cadavers, then he becomes a candidate  for death\nsentence.  If  psychoanalysts  and  psychiatrists  find\t him\nirredeemable in\t the reasonable\t run of\t time then his being\nalive will  involve more  lives being lost at his hands.

The houses of Ram Bharosey and Pyarelal\nhad fallen  out\t and  periodic\tfuelling  of  the  feud\t was\nfurnished by  the kidnapping  of a  wife, the  stabbing of a\nbrother and  the like. Lok Adalats of village elders brought\nabout truce,  not peace.  The next  flare-up was a murder by\nthe appellant,\ta rash\tson of\tone of\tthe  feuding  elders\nPyarelal. He was sentenced to life imprisonment (which means\nno reformation\tbut hardening  process, since  our jails are\ninnocent of  carefully designed\t programme of  re-humanizing\nbut have  an iatrogenic,  inherited drill of de-humanising).\nThe young  man, after  some  years  served  in\tprison,\t was\nreleased  on  Gandhi  Jayanti  Day.  But  Gandhian  hospital\nsetting was,  perhaps, absent  in the  prison which,  in all\nprobability, was untouched by reformation of diseased minds,\nthe fundamental Gandhian thought. The result was the release\nkept  alive  his  vendetta  on\treturn,\t aggravated  by\t the\n&#x27;zoological&#x27; life  inside. Some\t minor incident\t ignited his\nlatent feud  and he  stabbed Ram  Bharosey  and\t his  friend\nMansukh\t several   times,  and\tthe  latter  succumbed.\t The\n&#x27;desperate character&#x27;  once sentenced,\tdeserved death\tthis\nsecond time,  said the\tSessions Court\tand the\t High  Court\nconfirmed the view.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_177\">     An application of the canons we have laid down directly\narises. There  is the common confusion here. A second murder\nis not\tto be  confounded with\tthe persistent potential for\nmurderous attacks  by the murderer. This was not a menace to\nthe social  order but  a specific  family feud.\t While every\ncrime is  a breach  of social  peace, the assailant is bound\nover only if he is a public menace. Likewise, here was not a\nyouth of  uncontrollable violent  propensities\tagainst\t the\ncom-\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">130</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_178\">munity but  one whose  paranoid preoccupation  with a family\nquarrel goaded\thim to\tgo at  the rival. The distinction is\nfine but  real. How  do we designate him &#x27;desperate&#x27; without\nblaming the  jail which\t did little to make a man out of the\ncriminal clay  ? So long as therapeutic processes are absent\nfrom prisons, these institutions, far from being the healing\nhope of\t society, prove hardening schools to train desperate\ncriminals. The\tpitiless verse\tof Oscal  Wilde is pitifully\ntrue even today:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_57\">\t  &quot;The vilest deeds, like poison weeds,\n\t  Bloom well in prison air;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_58\">\t  It is only what is good in Man\n\t  That wastes and withers there&quot;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_59\">&quot;Desperate criminal&quot;  is a convenient description to brand a\nperson.

One\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">131</span>\nrandy Janardanan-the appellant-with a wife and two children,\ndeveloped sex relations with a fresh girl and the inevitable\nsocial resistance  to this  betrayal of marital fidelity led\nto a  barbaric short-cut  by this  in criminal of cutting to\ndeath the  innocent wife  and the  immaculate  kids  in\t the\nsecrecy of  night. To  borrow the  vivid words of the courts\nbelow, &#x27;deliberate&#x27;, &#x27;cold-blooded&#x27; was the act, attended as\nit  was\t  with\t&#x27;considerable  brutality&#x27;.  This  ruled\t out\nmitigation and supplied &#x27;special reasons&#x27;, according to both\nthe courts  below, for\tthe awesome  award of death penalty.\nWas that  right ? If the crime alone was the criterion, yes;\nbut if the criminal was the target, no.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_64\">     The brucial  question is  whether\tthe  crime  and\t its\nhorrendous  character\texcept\tto  the\t extent\t it  reveals\nirreparable depravity  and chronic  propensity is  relevant.\nThe innocent  three will  not be  happy because\t one  guilty\ncompanion is  also added  to their  number. Is\tJanardanan a\nsocial\tsecurity   risk,  altogether   beyond\tsalvage\t  by\ntherapeutic life  sentence ? If he is, the pall must fall on\nhis cadayer.  If not,  life must  burn\ton.  So\t viewed,  no\nmaterial, save\tjuridical wrath and grief, is discernible to\ninvoke social  justice and  revoke his\tfundamental right to\nlife. A\t course of  anti-aphrodisiac  treatment\t or  willing\ncastration is a better recipe for this hypersexed human than\noutright death\tsentence. We  have not\teven information  on\nwhether he  was a  desperate hedonist or any rapist with &#x27;Y&#x27;\nchromosomes in\texcess, who  sipped every flower and changed\nevery hour,  so as  to be  a sex  menace  to  the  locality.\nSentencing is a delicate process, not a bling man&#x27;s buff. We\ncommute the death sentence to life imprisonment.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_65\">\t\t       THE DUBEY CASE\n     There were\t three accused\tto begin with. The appellant\nwas convicted of the murder of three relatives and sentenced\nto death.  The other  two were\theld guilty, by the Sessions\nJudge of  an offence  of<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_125\"> s.  302</a> read  with<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_126\"> s. 34</a> I.P.C. and\nawarded life  imprisonment. The\t appeal of  the\t latter\t was\nallowed and  that of  the former dismissed both on crime and\npunishment. The learned Judges expressed themselves thus:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_66\">\t  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1596143\" id=\"span_62\">&quot;Considering that  Sheo Shankar,  appellant caused\n     the death\tof three  persons so closely related to him,\n     by stabbing  each of  them in  the chest  one after the\n     other, and that too on no greater provocation than that\n     there had\tbeen an exchange of abuses, I do not see how\n     it can  be said that sentence of death errs on the side\n     of severity.  It was urged that this appellant was only\n     17, 18 years old and so in view of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">132</span>\n     the ruling of the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/1596143/\" id=\"a_127\">Harnam v. State</a> (AIR\n     1976 SC  2071), he should not be sentenced to death. In\n     the first\tplace, the note of learned Sessions Judge on\n     his statement shows that he was 19, 20 years old and he\n     had understated  his age.\tSecondly, I  doubt that\t the\n     observation of  the Supreme  Court in the said case can\n     be applicable  to such  a case  of triple murder, where\n     such victim is deliberately stabbed in the chest.&quot;</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_179\">The whole  reasoning crumbles on a gentle probe. A thumbnail\nsketch of the case is that the appellant, his father and his\nbrother were  angrily dissatisfied  with a  family partition\nand, on\t the tragic day, flung the vessels over the division\nof which  the wrangle  arose, went inside the house, emerged\narmed, picked up an altercation eventuating in the young man\n(whose age  was around\t18 or  20) stabbing  to death  three\nmembers of  the other  branch of  the family.  He chased and\nkilled, excited\t by the\t perverted sense of injustice at the\npartition. It  is illegal  to award capital sentence without\nconsidering the\t correctional possibilities  inside  prison.\nAnger, even  judicial anger,  solves no problems but creates\nmany.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_180\">     Have the courts below regarded the question of sentence\nfrom this angle ? Not at all. The genesis of the crime shows\na family  feud. He  was not  a murderer born but made by the\npassion of  family quarrel.  He could  be saved\t for society\nwith correctional  techniques and  directed into  repentance\nlike the Chambal dacoits.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_181\">     What startles  us is  the way  the adolescence  of\t the\naccused has  been by-passed  and  a  ruling  of\t this  Court\nreduced to  a casualty\tby a  casual observation. Hardly the\nway decisions  of the  Supreme Court,  read  with  <a href=\"/doc/882644/\" id=\"a_128\">Art.\t 141</a>\nshould be by-passed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_182\">     Had the  appellant been  only 18 years of age, he would\nnot have been sentenced to death as the High Court expressly\nstates. The High Court is right in stating so. Tender age is\na tender circumstance and in this country, unlike in England\nof old,\t children are  not executed.  Since the\t age of\t the\naccused\t is  of\t such  critical\t importance  in\t a  marginal\nsituation like\tthe present  one, one  should have  expected\nfrom the  courts below\ta closer examination of that aspect.\nUnfortunately, they  have  not\tgot  the  accused  medically\nexamined for  his age  nor have\t they received\tany specific\nevidence on the point but have disposed of the question in a\nrather summary\tway: &quot;In  the first  place, the\t note of the\nlearned Sessions  Judge on  his statement  shows that he was\n19/20 years old and he had understated his age. Secondly,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_64\">133</span>\nI doubt\t that the  observations of  the Supreme Court in the\nsaid case  (AIR 1976  SC 2071)\tcan be\tapplicable to such a\ncase of\t triple murder,\t where each  victim is\tdeliberately\nstabbed in  the chest.&quot;\t A judge  is no expert in fixing the\nage of\ta  person  and\twhen  precise  age  becomes  acutely\nimportant  reliance   on  medical  and\tother  testimony  is\nnecessary. One\tcannot agree with this manner of disposal of\na vital\t factor bearing\t on  so\t grave\tan  issue  as  death\nsentence. Nor  are  we\tsatisfied  with\t the  court  vaguely\ndistinguishing a  ruling of this Court. It is not the number\nof deaths  caused nor the situs of the stabs that is telling\non that\t decision to  validate the  non-application  of\t its\nratio. It  is a mechanistic art which counts the cadavers to\nsharpen the  sentence oblivious\t of other  crucial  criteria\nshaping a dynamic, realistic policy of punishment.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_183\">     Three deaths  are regrettable, indeed, terrible. But it\nis no social solution to add one more life lost to the list.\nIn this\t view, we  are satisfied  that the appellant has not\nreceived reasonable  consideration on  the question  of\t the\nappropriate sentence.  The criteria  we have  laid down\t are\nclear enough  to point\tto the\tsoftening of the sentence to\none of\tlife imprisonment.  A family feud, an altercation, a\nsudden\tpassion,   although  attended\twith  extra-ordinary\ncruelty, young\tand malleable  age, reasonable\tprospect  of\nreformation and\t absence of any conclusive circumstance that\nthe assailant  is a  habitual murderer\tor given  to chronic\nviolence-these\tcatena\t of  circumstances  bearing  on\t the\noffender call for the lesser sentence.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_184\">     It is  apt to  notice in  this context  that even\ton a\ntraditional approach  this is not a case for death sentence,\nif we are to be belighted by the guidelines in Carlose John.\nThe murder  there was brutal but the act was committed while\nthe accused  were in  a grip  of emotional  stress. This was\nregarded as  persuasive enough,\t in the\t background  of\t the\ncase, to  avoid the  extreme penalty.  The ruling  in Kartar\nSingh related  to a  case of  brutal  murder  and  of  hired\nmurderers with\tplanning of  the criminal  project. In\tthat\nbackground, the\t affirmation of\t the death sentence, without\nany discussion\tof the\tguidelines  as\tbetween\t &#x27;life&#x27;\t and\n&#x27;death&#x27; awards\twas hardly meant as a mechanical formula. It\nis difficult to discern any such ratio in that ruling on the\nquestion of  sentence in the grey area of life versus death.\nThe holding  was surely\t right even  by the  tests  we\thave\nindicated but  to decoct a principle that if three lives are\ntaken, death  sentence is  the sequel,\tis to  read, without\nwarrant, into that decision a reversal of the process spread\nover decades.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_65\">134</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_185\">     Social defence against murderers is best insured in the\nshort run  by caging them but in the long run, the real run,\nby transformation through re-orientation of the inner man by\nmany methods  including neuro-techniques  of which we have a\nrich legacy.  If the  prison system  will  talk\t the  native\nlanguage, we  have the\tyogic treasure to experiment with on\nhigh-strung, high-risk murder merchants. Neuroscience stands\non the\tthreshold of  astounding discoveries.  Yoga, in\t its\nmany forms,  seems to  hold splendid  answers.\tMeditational\ntechnology as  a tool  of criminology  is a  mascent-ancient\nmethodology. The  State must  experiment. It  is cheaper  to\nhang than  to heal,  but Indian\t life-any human\t life-is too\ndear to be swung dead save in extreme circumstances.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_186\">     We are  painfully mindful that this Judgment has become\nprolix and  diffuse. But  too many  pages are not too high a\nprice where  death sentence  jurisprudence demands  de\tnovo\nexamination to do justice by the Constitution.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_187\">     Much of  what we  have said  is an\t exercise  in  penal\nphilosophy in the critical area of death sentence.\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_67\">     &quot;Philosophizing  is   distrusted\tby   most   of\t the\nprofessions that  are concerned with the penal system.

In an appeal confined to sentence under <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_129\">Article\n136</a> of\tthe Constitution, this Court has not only the power,\nbut as\twell as\t the duty  to interfere if it considers that\nthe appellant should be sentenced &#x27;differently&#x27;, that is, to\nset aside  the sentence of death and substitute in its place\nthe sentence  of imprisonment  for life, where it considers,\ntaking the  case as  a whole,  the sentence  of death  to be\nerroneous, excessive  or indicative  of an improper exercise\nof discretion;\tbut at\tthe same time, the Court must impose\nsome limitations  on itself  in the  exercise of  this broad\npower. In  dealing with\t a sentence  which has been made the\nsubject of an appeal, the Court will interfere with a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">135</span>\nsentence only  where it\t is &#x27;erroneous\tin  principle&#x27;.\t The\nquestion, therefore,  in each  case is\twhether there  is an\n&#x27;error of principle&#x27; involved.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_191\">     The Court\thas the\t duty to  see that on the particular\nfacts and circumstances of each case the punishment fits the\ncrime. Mere  compassionate sentiments  of a  humane  feeling\ncannot be  a sufficient reason for not confirming a sentence\nof death but altering it into a sentence of imprisonment for\nlife. In  awarding sentence,  the Court\t must, as it should,\nconcern\t itself\t with  justice,\t that  is,  with  unswerving\nobedience to  established law.\tIt is,\tand  must  be,\talso\nconcerned with\tthe probable  effect of its sentence both on\nthe general public and the culprit.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_192\">     In the  three cases  before  us,  there  were  &#x27;special\nreasons&#x27; within\t the meaning  of<a href=\"/doc/203036/\" id=\"a_130\"> s.  354</a>, sub-s.

Indeed, they  are illustrative  of the\nrare type  of cases,  that is, first degree murders, where a\ndeath sentence\tis usually awarded in any civilised country.\nThese were  cases of diabolical, cold blooded brutal murders\nof innocent  persons,  that  is,  first\t degree\t murders  of\nextreme brutality  or depravity.

He   asserts  that   by\t its\napplication, the death penalty contradicts the very sanctity\nof life\t which all  human society  claims to  hold among the\nhighest values.\t He  tells  us\tthat  almost  all  civilised\ncountries have abolished it as a symbol of their respect for\nhuman life,  and expresses  deep anguish  that\twe,  in\t our\ncountry, still\tcling to  it with little regard to the basic\nrights of the man.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_71\">     I fully  reciprocate the feelings of my learned brother\nKrishna Iyer  J. in  so far  as he  speaks of  the barbarity\ninvolved in  killing of\t patriots who  have sacrificed their\nlives in  the country&#x27;s\t struggle for freedom. The citizen&#x27;s\nright to life and personal liberty are guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_135\">Article\n21</a>  of\t the  Constitution  irrespective  of  his  political\nbeliefs, class,\t creed or religion. The Constitution has, by\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_136\">Article 21</a>  itself forged  certain procedural safeguards for\nprotection to  the citizen of his life and personal liberty.\nThe idealistic\tconsiderations as  to the inherent worth and\ndignity of  man is  a fundamental and pervasive theme of the\nConstitution, to  guard against\t the execution\tof a citizen\nfor his political beliefs.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_72\">     1, however,  must\tenter  a  dissent  when\t my  learned\nbrother Krishna\t Iyer J.  tries to  equate a patriot with an\nordinary  criminal.   The  humanistic  approach\t should\t not\nobscure our  sense of  realities. When a man commits a crime\nagainst\t the  society  by  committing  a  diabolical,  cold-\nblooded, pre-planned  murder,  of  an  innocent\t person\t the\nbrutality of  which shocks  the conscience  of the Court, he\nmust face  the\tconsequences  of  his  act.

John Stuart Mill, made a very strong speech in the\nHouse of  Commons(1) advocating the use of the death penalty\nwhen it\t was applied  to the   most heinous cases. Attacking\nthe argument  that this\t punishment was\t not a\tdeterrent to\ncrime, he said:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_83\">\t  &quot;As for  what\t is  called  the  failure  of  death\n     sentence, who is able to judge that.

If there\t were the slightest doubt of a man&#x27;s\ninnocence the death sentence would not be imposed or carried\nout.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_201\">     Sir Henry\tMaine, the English legal historian, observed\nthat punishment\t evolved from  social necessity. The concept\nof punishment  as a  form of  expiation or atonement reaches\nfar back  into human  nature as\t well as into human history.\nThe notion  that the  threat of punishment by the State will\nrestrain the  potential criminal is one of the most commonly\naccepted justifications for it. The idea has a philosophical\nbasis in  the utilitarians&#x27;  concept  of  the  rational\t man\nacting upon  a deliberate calculation of possible losses and\ngains.\tIf  men\t choose\t rationally  among  possible  future\ncourses of  action then\t surely the likelihood of a criminal\ncourse of  action could\t be decreased  by attaching  to it a\nquick, certain and commensurate penalty.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_202\">     The value\tof  capital  punishment,  as  an  aspect  of\ndeterrence, was\t perhaps most  strongly put forward and very\nclearly stated\tby the\tgreat jurist,  Sir  James  Fitzjames\nStephen more than a hundred years ago:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_84\">\t  &quot;No other  punishment deters\tman  so\t effectually\n     from committing crimes as the punishment of death. This\n     is one  of those  propositions which it is difficult to\n     prove, simply  because  they  are\tin  themselves\tmore\n     obvious than any proof can make them. It is possible to\n     display ingenuity\tin arguing  against it,\t but that is\n     all. The  whole experience\t of mankind  is in the other\n     direction. The  threat of\tinstant death  is the one to\n     which resort  has always  been made  when there  was an\n     absolute necessity\t for producing\tsome result..No\t one\n     goes to  certain inevitable death except by compulsion.\n     Put the  matter the  other way.  Was there\t ever yet  a\n     criminal who,  when sentenced  to death and brought out\n     to die,  would refuse  the offer  of commutation of his\n     sentence for the severest secondary punishment ? Surely\n     not. Why  is this\t? It can only be because &#x27;All that a\n     man has  will he  give for\t his life&#x27;. In any secondary\n     punishment, however  terrible, there is hope; but death\n     is\t death;\t  its  terrors\t cannot\t be  described\tmore\n     forcibly.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_203\">     Supporters of capital punishment commonly maintain that\nit has\ta uniquely  deterrent force  which no  other form of\npunishment has or\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_73\">140</span>\ncould have.  The arguments  adduced both  in support of this\nproposition and\t against it  fall into\ttwo categories.\t The\nfirst consists\tof  what  we  may  call\t the  &#x27;common  sense\nargument&#x27;  from\t human\tnature\tapplicable  particularly  to\ncertain kinds  of murders  and certain\tkinds of  murderers.\nThis, a\t priori argument  proceeds on the view that by doing\nso, the\t law helps  to foster  in the  community  a  special\nabhorrence of  murder as  &quot;a crime  of crimes&quot;. By reserving\nthe death  penalty for\tmurder the  criminal law stigmatises\nthe gravest  crime by  the gravest  punishment, so  that the\nelement of  retribution merges\tinto that of deterrence. The\nsecond justifies  the ethics of capital punishment. Whatever\nbe the\tultimate justification\tfor the\t punishment, the law\ncannot\tignore\tthe  public  demand  for  retribution  which\nheinous crimes\tundoubtedly provoke;  it would\tbe generally\nagreed\tthat,  though  reform  of  the\tcriminal  law  ought\nsometimes to  give a lead to public opinion, it is dangerous\nto move too far in advance of it.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_204\">     The movement  to abolish death penalty started with the\nhumanitarian doctrine evolved by Marchese De Cesars Bonesana\nBeccaria, Italian publicist. In 1764, Bonesana published the\nfamous little  treaties Dei  Delitti e della Pen. The French\ntranslation contained  anonymous preface by Voltaire. In the\npreface to this book first appeared the phrase &quot;the greatest\nhappiness  of\tthe  greatest\tnumber&quot;.  It  advocated\t the\nprevention of  crime rather  than punishment, and promptness\nin punishment, where punishment was inevitable; above all it\ncondemned confiscation,\t capital  punishment,  and  torture.\nBeccaria&#x27;s   ideas   directly\tinfluenced   the   reforming\nactivities of  many social  thinkers and  philosophers. This\nrepresented  a\t school\t of   doctrine,\t born\tof  the\t new\nhumanitarian impulse  of the  Eighteenth Century  with which\nRousseau, Voltaire  and Montesquieu in France and Bentham in\nEngland were  associated, which\t came afterwards to be known\nas the classical school.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_205\">     Moved by  compassionate sentiment\tof a humane feeling,\nBeccaria asserted  that all  capital punishment\t is wrong in\nitself and  unjust. He maintained that since man was not his\nown creator,  he did  not have\tthe right  to destroy  human\nlife,  either\tindividually  or  collectively.\t It  is\t the\nultimate  cruel,   inhuman  and\t degrading  punishment,\t and\nviolates the right to life. Its basic value, he affirmed, is\nits  incapacitative   effect.\tBeccaria   claimed   capital\npunishment was\tjustified in only two instances, first if an\nexecution would\t prevent a  revolution against\ta  popularly\nestablished government,\t and secondly,\tif an  execution was\nthe only way to deter others from committing a crime.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_74\">141</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_206\">     The policy of retribution is justified and sustained by\nan  ethical   philosophy  which\t regards  punishment  as  an\nintegral and  inviolative element in wrong doing, as a moral\nnecessity. This doctrine has been consistently maintained by\nintuitive or  idealistic philosophers  from Plato  to Thomas\nAquinas and  from Kant to T. H. Green and his disciples. The\ndeterrent effect  of punishment\t has also  been\t claimed  by\nadherents of  this school  but its  widespread adoption as a\npolicy has  probably been  due more  to the influence of the\nutilitarian philosophy\tof Bentham,  Paley, John Stuart Mill\nand Herbert  Spencer, which makes the welfare of the society\n&quot;the greatest  good of\tthe greatest number&quot;, the aim of all\nmoral activity.\t It is\tthis utilitarian philosophy which is\nnow in\tthe ascendent in penal legislation and which governs\nthe view  of most  modern penologists.\tIt still survives in\nthe death  penalty for\tmurder and  in the drastic penalties\nimposed for  rape and  other  crimes  which  are  peculiarly\noffensive to the moral sentiment as to the sense of security\nof the community.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_207\">     Nearly everywhere,\t in the more recent stages of social\ndevelopment, this  motive has  been supplemented,  but never\nwholly\tsupplanted,   by  an   unquestioning  faith  in\t the\ndeterrent effect  on potential offenders of exemplary, i.e.,\ndrastic, punishment, inflicted on actual offenders which, in\npractice if not in theory, comes to much the same thing.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_208\">     The doctrine  of the &quot;individualisation of punishment&quot;,\nthat is\t to say\t of the\t punishment of the individual rather\nthan the  crime committed  by him,  which is  of  commanding\nimportance in present day penology, is only a development of\nthe neo-classical  school of  the  revolutionary  period  in\nFrance,\t which\tmodified  Beccaria&#x27;s  rigorous\tdoctrine  by\ninsisting on  the recognition  of  the\tvarying\t degrees  of\nmoral, and  therefore, legal responsibility. Its fundamental\ndoctrine is  that the  criminal is  doomed by  his inherited\ntraits to  a criminal  career and  is, therefore,  a  wholly\nirresponsible actor. Society must, of course, protect itself\nagainst him,  but to  punish him  as if he were a free moral\nagent is as irrational as it is unethical.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_209\">     In\t his  &#x27;Introduction  to\t Principles  of\t Morals\t and\nLegislation&#x27;,  the   great  work   in  which   the   English\nphilosopher and\t jurist, Jeremy Bentham was engaged for many\nyears, was published in 1789. Mankind, he said, was governed\nby  two\t  sovereign  motives-pain   and\t pleasure,  and\t the\nprinciple of  utility recognised this subjection. The object\nof all\tlegislation must  be the  &quot;greatest happiness of the\ngreatest number&quot;.  On the  legal side,\the deduced  from the\nprinciple of  utility that  since all  punishment is  itself\nevil it\t ought only to be admitted &quot;so far as it promises to\nexclude some greater evil&quot;.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_75\">142</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_210\">     The English social reformer, Sir Samuel Romilly devoted\nhimself primarily  to reform  the criminal  law of  England,\nthen at once cruel and illogical, by attempting to influence\nParliament to  pass three Bills designed to repeal the death\npenalty for  theft. By statute law innumerable offences were\npunishable  with   death  in   England,\t but,  as  wholesale\nexecution would\t be impossible,\t the larger  number of those\nconvicted and  sentenced to  death  at\tevery  assizes\twere\nrespited, after\t having heard the sentence of death solemnly\npassed upon them. This led to many acts of injustice, as the\nlives of  convicts depended  on the  caprice of\t the Judges,\nwhile, at  the\tsame  time  it\tmade  the  whole  system  of\npunishment and\tof the\tcriminal  law  ridiculous.  In\t1808\nRomilly managed\t to repeal  the Elizabethian  statute, which\nmade it\t a capital  offence to steal from the person. In the\nfollowing  year,  three\t equally  sanguinary  statutes\twere\nthrown out of the House of Lords under the influence of Lord\nEllenborough. Year  after year the same influence prevailed,\nand Romilly  saw his bills rejected; but his patient efforts\nand his\t eloquence ensured  victory eventually for his cause\nby opening  the eyes of Englishmen to the barbarity of their\ncriminal law.  In spite of the efforts which Romilly made to\nprocure the abolition of the death penalty in many cases, it\nshould be  noted, however, that he was not an &quot;abolitionist&quot;\nin the sense of the term today.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_211\">     All punishment  properly implies  moral accountability.\nIt is  related to  injury and  not only to damage or danger,\nhowever great.\tCapital punishment  does so  in\t an  eminent\ndegree. It  is directed\t against one  who is ex-hypothesi an\ninhuman brute,\ti.e. it\t is imposed  simply to eliminate one\nwho is\theld to have become, irretrievably, a liability or a\nmenace to society.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_212\">     As Aristotle  put it,  just retribution consists not in\nsimple\tbut   in  proportionate\t retaliation,  that  is,  in\nreceiving in  return for  a wrongful  act not the same thing\nbut its equivalent, and, what this is, can only be estimated\nif the whole context is taken into account. It may be argued\nthat murder  for instance,  as the  one crime which is quite\nirrevocable, as\t justly met  by the  one punishment which is\nequally irrevocable,  a unique\tform  of  punishment  for  a\nunique form  of crime. To reduce its punishment to something\nof the\tsame order  as other  punishments, is  to weaken the\nabhorrence which  it should  express and  diffuse.  On\tthis\nshowing an  execution expresses\t absolute  condemnation.  It\nboth satisfies and educates the public conscience; for those\nin  authority\tthus  deepen   in  themselves\tand  diffuse\nthroughout the\tcommunity their\t sense of &quot;the wickedness of\nwickedness, the\t criminality of crime&quot;. It is an outward and\nvisible sign of the utmost imaginable disgrace. The death\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">143</span>\n     penalty  has   signified  shame   and  infamy  and\t has\ngenerally  been\t understood  to\t do  so;  and  all  this  is\nexpressed  in  symbolic\t action\t of  a\tkind  that  is\tboth\nspontaneous and calculated to arrest attention.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_213\">     If the appeal of capital punishment were merely to fear\nof death,  it would  be\t a  very  inefficient  protector  of\nsociety. In  civilized society\tand in peacetime, government\nrelies for  obedience more  on its  moral prestige  than  on\nviolent repression  of crime.  Punishment only protects life\neffectively if\tit produces  in possible murderers, not only\nfear  of  the  consequences  of\t committing  murder,  but  a\nhorrified recoil  from the thing itself. It can only achieve\nthis, more  ambitious, task, if sentence of death is felt to\nembody\tsociety&#x27;s   strongest  condemnation  of\t murder\t and\nkeenest sense  of its  intolerable wickedness.\tIt is not by\nthe fear  of death  but\t by  exciting  in  the\tcommunity  a\nsentiment of  horror against any particular act, that we can\nhope to\t deter\toffenders  from\t committing  it.  The  Royal\nCommission  sucinctly  explained  the  normal  character  of\ncapital punishment thus:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_85\">\t  &quot;by building\tup in  the community,  over  a\tlong\n     period of\ttime, a\t deep feeling of peculiar abhorrence\n     for the crime of murder.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_214\">     The criminality  of a  crime consists  not only  in the\ncriminal act,  but in  what that  signifies. Its immediately\napparent features,  the obvious damage to person or property\nor to public security, are symptoms of a deeper disorder. It\nbetokens, and  it fosters,  an attitude\t in man\t to man,  of\nreckless   selfishness,\t  deceit   or\tmalice,\t  which\t  is\nincompatible in the long run with any decent social life. In\nany advanced  society it is, in part at least, on account of\nthis wider character, less easily discerned, that the graver\noffences are punished. Also punishment like crime has a dual\ncharacter. The\tpenalty which  the convicted murderer incurs\nis not\tsimply death,  but death  in disgrace and death as a\ndisgrace. In  so far  as capital punishment is a threat, the\nthreat consists\t not only in death but in infamy. Any theory\nwhich ignores this characteristic is certainly defective.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_215\">     For a  long time  the problem of capital punishment was\nregarded as  a purely  academic\t question.  Everything\tthat\ncould be  said appear  to have been said on a question which\nBeccaria had  brilliantly brought  to public  notice in\t the\nsecond half  of the  Eighteenth Century,  but which had been\nexhausted by subsequent controversy. Punishment inflicted by\nthe State in response to a violation of the criminal law\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_77\">144</span>\nhas been  justified in\tvarious ways.  It has  been seen  as\nsociety&#x27;s vengeance  upon the  criminal as  atonement by the\nwrong doer,  as a  means of  deterring other  criminals,  as\nprotection  for\t  the  law-abiding   and   as\ta   way\t  of\nrehabilitating\tthe   criminal.\t The   individual  who\t has\ninflicted harm on another, runs the revenge argument, should\nbe made\t to suffer  in return;\tfor only an act of vengeance\ncan undo  the harm  that  has  been  done  and\tassuage\t the\nsuffering of the victim.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_216\">     As against\t this, some social reformers have maintained\nthat punishment\t ought to  be decent to transform the values\nand attitudes of the criminal so that he no longer wishes to\ncommit illegal\tacts. The  problem, of\tcourse, has  been to\ndiscover how  to  do  it.  Theories  of\t rehabilitation\t are\nlargely speculative,  since  there  is\tlack  of  scientific\nevidence  to   support\tthem.\tNevertheless,  it  has\tbeen\ninfluential in the development of modern penology.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_217\">     In England, during the Nineteenth Century, Disraeli and\nGladstone, the\tleading politicians  in the country, took no\npart  in   the\tmovement   to  abolish\tthe  death  penalty.\nLeadership in  this crusade  fell to  lesser  men,  and\t the\nabolitionists formed  a distinct  minority. The\t majority in\nthe House of Commons evidently felt, as Sir John Holkar, the\nAttorney General  felt, that  criminals were  deterred\tfrom\nadding deliberate  murder to  their other crimes by the fear\nof the\tdeath penalty.\tIn the\tperiod between the first and\nsecond world  wars, however,  the emergence of authoritarian\nsystems of penal law raised once more the problem of capital\npunishment in a particularly acute manner. At the end of the\nsecond world  war, there  was  a  renewed  upsurge  of\tthis\nhumanitarian tendency  which, like  the desire\tto safeguard\nhuman rights  and human\t dignity, had been the mainspring of\nthe movement for the abolition of the death penalty.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_218\">     Several attempts  were made  to break the parliamentary\nfortress but  without any  success. Very little was actually\naccomplished by\t the abolitionists  in Parliament till after\nthe second  world war,\twhen the  Labour Government  came to\npower. In  between 1949\t and 1953  the Royal  Commission  on\nCapital Punishment carried out an exhaustive inquiry.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_219\">     The Royal\tCommission made\t a study of this complex and\nmany-sided task.

It\nlistened to an impressive array of witnesses. In addition to\nall  this,   information  was  collected  from\tCommonwealth\ncountries and several other European countries. Its\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_78\">145</span>\nresult is  reflected  in  the  Royal  Commission  Report  on\nCapital\t Punishment   which  presents  a  comprehensive\t and\ndispassionate picture of the whole subject.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_220\">     The Commission was debarred by their terms of reference\nfrom  considering  the\tquestion  of  abolition\t of  capital\npunishment, but\t in the\t course of  their investigation they\nnaturally accumulated  a good  deal of\tinformation which is\njust as\t relevant to  this  issue  as  to  the\tquestion  of\nlimiting  the\tscope  of  capital  punishment.\t The  report\ncontains a  good deal of material on the &quot;Deterrent Value of\nCapital Punishment&quot;. It is evident from the report that some\nof the\tmost distinguished judicial witnesses including Lord\nGoddard, the  Lord Chief  Justice of  England, Lord Denning,\nthe Master  of Rolls,  and some very experienced Judges like\nMr. Justice Humphreys, Sir John Beaumont, Mr. Justice Byrne,\nwere firmly  of the view that the capital punishment must be\nretained for the protection of the society. They went to the\nextent of expressing their strong disapprobation of the free\nuse of prerogative as being an interference by the Executive\nwith the Judiciary and argued that the exercise of the power\nshould be narrowly confined.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_221\">     As a justification for retention of death penalty, some\nof these  distinguished Judges\tput forth  the principle  of\nretribution, and  the others  placed greater  importance  on\ndeterrence.  There  was,  however,  general  agreement\tthat\njustification for the capital sentence, as for other salient\nfeatures  of   the  penal  system  must\t be  sought  in\t the\nprotection of the society and that alone.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_222\">     The punishment of death, said Lord Denning to the Royal\nCommission, should reflect adequately the revulsion felt for\nthe gravest  of crimes\tby the\tgreat majority\tof citizens.\nBut, in\t saying this, he implied that legislators and Judges\nshare this  revulsion  themselves;  otherwise  indeed  their\naction would  be morally indefensible. Their aim then should\nbe, not\t only to  strike terror\t nor even  to awaken popular\nindignation in\ta direction  convenient\t to  Government.  It\nwould be  to arouse  in all  and sundry\t their own indignant\nrepudiation of a wicked act and, at the same time, to deepen\nit in  themselves. In  this vein, sentence of death has been\npronounced,  carried   out   and   acclaimed,\twith   stern\nsatisfaction. This  principle of  action is  still avowed in\nhigh places,  and, I believe, it is semi-consciously at work\nmore often than it is avowed, for it is said that otherwise,\nthe conscience\tof the\tcommunity would\t be revolted  if the\ncriminal were  allowed to live. In the same vein, Lord Chief\nJustice Goddard said in 1948:\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_79\">146</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_86\">\t  &quot;The public  conscience  will\t not  tolerate\tthat\n     persons who deliberately condemn others to painful, and\n     it may  be lingering,  deaths should be allowed to live\n     ....  Some\t  of  these   bestial  murderers  should  be\n     destroyed.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_223\">     The use  of capital  punishment has  declined in recent\ntimes, although\t it is\tstill permitted\t by law,  as in this\ncountry, for  various kinds of offences like treason, murder\netc.  The   issue  of\tabolishing  it\t has  aroused\tmuch\ncontroversy. The advocates of capital punishment claim it as\na necessary  deterrent to  crime and  relatively painless if\ndone properly.\tEven where  it has been legally retained, as\nhere, capital  punishment is  now seldom  employed except in\nvery grave cases where it is a crime against the society and\nthe brutality  of the  crime shocks the judicial conscience.\nIndeed,\t the   death   penalty\t satisfies   the   society&#x27;s\nretributive goals and is still presumed to be a deterrent to\npotential offenders. Of the three purposes commonly assigned\nto  punishment-retribution,   deterrence  and\treformation-\ndeterrence is  generally held  to  be  the  most  important,\nalthough the continuing public demand for retribution cannot\nbe ignored.  Prima facie,  the death  sentence is  likely to\nhave a\tstronger effect\t as a  deterrent upon  normal  human\nbeings than  any other\tform of\t punishment. There  is\tsome\nevidence that  this is,\t in fact, so and also that abolition\nmay be\tfollowed by  an increase  in homicides and crimes of\nviolence.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_224\">     In brief,\tpeople are  believed to\t refrain from  crime\nbecause they  fear punishment.\tSince people fear death more\nthan anything  else the\t death penalty is the most effective\ndeterrent.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_225\">     In\t Britain,   following  the   Report  of\t  the  Royal\nCommission on Capital Punishment, the Homicide Act, 1957 was\nenacted due  to the  growing pressure  of public  opinion to\nmitigate the  rigour of\t the criminal  law.

But he did not believe\n&quot;that society&#x27;s\t need&quot;\tfor  specific  deterrence  justifies\ndeath for so few when for so many in like circumstances life\nimprisonment or shorter prison terms are judged sufficient.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_248\">     Mr. Justice  Brennan and  Mr. Justice  Marshall took  a\nnormative approach.  They advocated  the total\tabolition of\nthe death  penalty because  it is  in all cases violative of\nthe Eighth  Amendment cruel  and unusual  punishment clause.\nFor them,  the Eighth  Amendment posed\ta core\tquestion  of\nvalues; they  were concerned less with fairness and equality\nand more  with mercy  and charity.  For Mr. Justice Brennan,\n&quot;the primary  principle....is that  a punishment must not by\nits severity  be degrading  to human  dignity&quot;. Mr.  Justice\nMarshall, in  by far  the longest opinion of the day pleaded\nfor an\thumanistic approach.  His impassioned conclusion was\nthat ending the death sentence would recognise &quot;the humanity\nof our\tfellow beings&quot; and achieve &quot;a major milestone in the\nlong road up from barbarism&quot;.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_87\">154</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_249\">     The opinions  of the  four dissenting  Justices were as\nimportant as  the majority statements because any subsequent\nchallenges on  Furman would incorporate their reasoning. Mr.\nJustice\t Blackman   and\t Mr.   Justice\tRehnquist,  who\t are\nadvocates of  strict judicial  conservation, felt  that\t the\nmatter was essentially political, and properly the domain of\nthe legislature, not the judiciary.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_250\">     Chief Justice Burger, admitting that since the ruling a\nTrop v.\t Dulles (supra) in 1958, it is necessary to evaluate\na challenged  punishment in terms of the &quot;evolving standards\nof decency.... of a maturing society&quot;, felt nonetheless that\nthere is  no judicially\t significant  public  opposition  to\ncapital punishment  in the  United States. Pointing out that\nthe decision  rejecting the  death penalty  was\t essentially\nbased on procedural grounds, as the majority agreed that the\narbitrary   infliction\t  of   the    death   penalty\t was\nunconstitutional, Burger  contends that the Eighth Amendment\ndoes not  deal with procedure, and with only the substantive\nnature of  the punishment  in question. He believes that the\nimposition of a mandatory death penalty for certain offences\nwould not be invalidated by the holding in this case because\na mandatory penalty could not be arbitrily meted out.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_251\">     Mr. Justice  Powell dissented  by establishing that the\nconstitutionality of  the death penalty is supported by four\nfactors, viz.,\t(i) the\t references to capital punishment in\nthe Constitution,  (ii) the  past Supreme Court decisions on\nthe  death   penalty,  (iii)   the  limitation\tof  judicial\nrestraint, and (iv) the doctrine of separation of powers. He\nfound that  the evidence  of the  petitioners fell  short of\nsatisfying their burdens of persuasion with respect to these\nfactors.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_252\">     Due to  the ambiguity  of the  Furman decision,  it  is\nfortunate that\tthe Supreme Court gave further indication of\nits intentions\tregarding the  death penalty  in  subsequent\ndecisions. But\tFurman was not determinative of the issue on\nthe merits,  namely, the  constitutionality of\tthe  penalty\nbecause it  violates the  Eighth Amendment cruel and unusual\npunishment. It\twas widely  assumed that  the Court  had not\ndeclared capital punishment unconstitutional per se but only\nits unpredictable and fortuitous use.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_253\">     Since the\tFurman decision, the legislatures of thirty-\nfive states  in the  United States  acted to  tighten up the\nlaws under  which the  death penalty was to be imposed. They\ntook two different approaches. Some State including Georgia,\nFlorida and  Texas, established\t new procedures\t for capital\ncases requiring sentencing judges and juries to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_88\">155</span>\nconsider  certain   specified  aggravating   or\t  mitigating\ncircumstances of  the crime  and the  offender. There  was a\nbifurcated trial  with pre-sentencing,\thearing.  Courts  of\nAppeal were  given broader  authority to  decide whether the\ndeath penalty  was fair\t in the\t light of  the sentences for\nsimilar offences  These laws  were intended  to redress\t the\narbitrariness and racial prejudices renounced in Furman. But\nthe other  States, including  North Carolina,  Louisiana and\nOklahoma sought\t to meet  the Furman  objections by removing\nall flexibility from the sentencing process, though limiting\nthe offences  for which the death sentence could be imposed.\nAnyone found  guilty of\t the specified\toffences was  to  be\nsentenced to  death automatically.  The constitutionality of\nthe sentences  imposed under such procedures has been upheld\nby five State Supreme Courts.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_254\">     On July 2, 1976, the Supreme Court of the United States\ndelivered the  judgment it  had postponed a year earlier. It\nhanded down  five opinions  dealing with  the death penalty.\nThree of these were concerned with the mandatory sentence of\ndeath. All  involved the  crime of  murder. The\t five  cases\nwere: Gregg  v. Georgia,  Proffitt v Florida, Jurek v. Texas\nWoodson v. North Carolina, and Roberts v. Louisiana.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_255\">     The issue in the three cases dealing with discretionary\nsentencing  (Gregg,   Proffitt\tand   Jurek)   was   whether\nimposition of  the sentence of death for the crime of murder\nunder the  laws of the respective states violated the Eighth\nand Fourteenth\tAmendments. In\tall three, the Court reached\nthe same  conclusion, that  the punishment  of death did not\ninvariably violate the Constitution.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_256\">     The Court&#x27;s  reasons in  Gregg  as\t to  why  the  death\nsentence was  not a  per se  violation\tof  the\t Eighth\t and\nFourteenth amendments  were as\tfollows: First,\t history and\nprecedent do  not support  the\tconclusion  that  the  death\nsentence  is  a\t per  se  violation.  Second,  the  evolving\nstandards  of\tdecency\t argument   has\t been  substantially\nundercut in  the last  four years because a large segment of\nthe enlightened\t population regards  the  death\t penalty  as\nappropriate and\t necessary, as\tseen in\t the new legislation\npassed in response to Furman.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_257\">     The Court came to the conclusion that the death penalty\nwas  not   inherently  cruel  and  unusual.  It\t served\t two\nprincipal social purposes,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_89\">156</span>\nretribution and deterrence, and held that the death sentence\nfor the\t crime of  murder was (1) not without justification,\n(2) not\t unconstitutionally severe,  and (3)  not invariably\ndisproportionate to the crime.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_258\">     The   Court   found   that\t  Furman   mandated,   where\ndiscretionary sentencing  was used  there must\tbe  suitable\ndirection and  limitation to  minimise the  risk  of  wholly\narbitrary and  capricious action.  The bifurcated trial with\nstandards modelled  after the  Model Penal Code gives juries\njust such guidance. Therefore, the concerns of Furman can be\nmet by\tcarefully drafted  statutes that  ensure  sentencing\nauthorities are\t given adequate\t information and guidance in\nmaking their  decision. As  a general proposition, the Court\nconcluded that\tthese concerns\twere best  met by bifurcated\nproceedings  with   standards  to  guided  the\tuse  of\t the\nevidence.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_259\">     I wish to conclude this part of the judgment by quoting\nHerbert L.A.  Hart, who\t in his\t article on  &quot;Murder and the\nPrinciples of  Punishment: England  and the  United  States,\nadmirably sums up the two points of view:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_103\">\t  &quot;There  are\tindeed\t ways\tof   defending\t and\n     criticising  the\tdeath  penalty\t which\t are   quite\n     independent of  the utilitarian  position\tand  of\t the\n     questions of  fact which  the utilitarian will consider\n     as crucial.  For some people the death penalty is ruled\n     out entirely  as something\t absolutely evil which, like\n     torture, should  never be\tused however  many lives  it\n     might save. Those who take this view find that they are\n     sometimes met  by the  counter-assertion that the death\n     penalty is some thin which morality actually demands, a\n     uniquely\tappropriate    means   of   retribution\t  or\n     &quot;reprobation&quot; for\tthe worst of crimes, even if its use\n     adds nothing to the protection of human life.\n\t  &quot;Here we  have two  sharply  opposed\tyet  similar\n     attitudes: for  the one  the death\t penalty is  morally\n     excluded; for the other it is moral necessity; but both\n     alike are\tindependent  of\t any  question\tof  fact  or\n     evidence as  to what  the use of the death penalty does\n     by\t way   of  furthering  the  protection\tof  society.\n     Argument in  support of  views as absolute as these can\n     consist only  of an  invitation, on  the one  hand,  to\n     consider in  detail the execution of a human being, and\n     on the  other hand,  to consider  in detail  some awful\n     murder, and then to await the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_90\">157</span>\n     emergence either of a conviction that the death penalty\n     must never\t be used  or, alternatively,  that  it\tmust\n     never be completely abandoned.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_260\">     The controversy over capital punishment is not new. Its\nroots lie  deep in human history, and  its battles have been\nwaged on  and off  on  a  political  level  for\t almost\t two\ncenturies. It  is not necessary for this Court to attempt to\nanalyse the  substantive merits of the cases for and against\nthe death penalty for murder. It is in my view, essentially,\na question  for the  Parliament to  resolve and not for this\nCourt to decide.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_261\">     I feel  that it  is futile for us to attempt to project\nour personal  views in\ta matter  which lies in the realm of\npolitical  decision-making,   by  focussing   on  a   single\ncontroversy, the  question of  the proper  penalty  for\t the\ncrime of  murder. The  capital punishment  controversy falls\nwithin the strict limits of &#x27;independent&#x27; parliamentary law-\nmaking, and  is a  typical or  representative of the kind of\nproblems that  leaders of  Parliament  face  every  day.  In\nshort, the  case for  abolition of  the\t death\tsentence  is\npolitical, not\tconstitutional. The  Government carries\t the\nresponsibility of  law and  order. That\t is  the  first\t and\nfundamental duty  of any  Government. The  Executive has the\nduty of\t advising the  Government of  the laws\tit  believes\nnecessary for the national well-being. It is the duty of the\ncourts, including this Court, to administer the laws as they\nare.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_262\">     The Law  Commission, in  its  Thirty-fifth\t Report\t has\ndealt with  the question of abolition of capital punishment,\nof limiting the scope of death sentence under s. 302, and of\nthe  mode   of\texecution  of  the  sentence.

Almost\tall the\t State Governments, all High\nCourt  Judges,\tall  the  Bar  Associations  throughout\t the\ncountry,  many\tdistinguished  lawyers\twere  in  favour  of\nretention of  the death sentence. There was, in fact, almost\ncomplete &#x27;unanimity&#x27;  of view  on this complex question.

Each  case must\t depend on its own particular facts.\nThe question  of sentence  must, in  my view, be left to the\ndiscretion of  the Sessions  Judge trying the accused. Under\nthe present  Code, a  trial for\t murder is  divided into two\nstages. There  is a  bifurcated trial. The first part of the\ntrial is directed solely to the issue of guilt or innocence,\nand concludes with the finding of the Sessions Judge on that\nissue. At the end of the trial when he comes to a conclusion\nof guilt, he has to adjourn the case for hearing the accused\non the question of sentence.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_268\">     Section  235,  sub-s.

The burden is upon the prosecution to make out\na case\tfor imposition\tof  the\t extreme  penalty.  Where  a\nsentence of  death is passed, the Sessions Judge has to make\na reference  to the  High Court\t under s. 366, sub-s. (1) of\nthe Code.  Under s. 367, sub-s.

In a case submitted under s.\n366, the  High Court  under s. 368(a) may either confirm the\nsentence, or  pass  any\t other\tsentence,  i.e.\t reduce\t the\nsentence of  death into a sentence of imprisonment for life.\nThereafter, an\tappeal lies to this Court by a special leave\nunder <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_178\">Article 136</a> on the question of sentence.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_269\">     Failing the  appeal, there\t is the President&#x27;s power to\ngrant reprieve\tand pardon  under <a href=\"/doc/553757/\" id=\"a_179\">Article  72(1)</a>, as well as\nthe Governor&#x27;s power of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_93\">160</span>\ncommutation under <a href=\"/doc/873751/\" id=\"a_180\">Article 161</a> of the Constitution which is a\nsovereign function.  The power\tof the\tPresident and of the\nGovernor to  grant reprieves  and pardons  is wide enough to\ninclude the  power to  commute\tand  to\t remit\tsentence  of\npunishment. All\t cases of  capital  punishment\tare  closely\nscrutinised by\tthe Executive  at both\tthe  levels  to\t see\nwhether there  are such\t extenuating circumstances  as would\njustify a  reprieve,  and  the\tpower  to  commute  a  death\nsentence is  freely exercised,\twhenever there is some doubt\nas to  the severity  of the  punishment. Under\tthe  present\nsystem the prerogative of Mercy in the case of persons under\nsentence  of  death  works  well  and  it  produces  results\ngenerally regarded  as satisfactory.  It helps in mitigating\nthe rigour  of the  death sentence,  particularly in case of\nthose murderers\t whose execution  would\t offend\t the  public\nconscience. Very  few persons  under a sentence of death-may\nbe one\tor two\tin a  year, in a State are usually executed.\nSuch cases  are usually\t of the\t kind indicated by me above,\nand even some of them escape the sentence of death.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_270\">     It is,  therefore, not  proper for\t the Court to trench\nupon the  President&#x27;s or the Governor&#x27;s prerogative to grant\npardon or  reprieve under  <a href=\"/doc/553757/\" id=\"a_181\">Articles 72(1)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/873751/\" id=\"a_182\">161</a>, in taking\nupon itself  the task  of commutation  of a  death sentence,\nwhich is properly imposed, in the facts and circumstances of\na particular  case, merely because there is a doubt that the\nExecutive may  commute the  sentence ultimately, or by one&#x27;s\nviews as  to the  utility of  a death  penalty.\t Judges\t are\nentitled to hold their own views, but it is the bounden duty\nof the\tCourt to  impose a proper punishment, depending upon\nthe degree  of criminality  and the  desirability to  impose\nsuch punishment as a measure of social necessity, as a means\nof deterring  other potential  offenders. It is only in very\ngrave cases  where it is a crime against the society and the\nbrutality of  the crime\t shocks the judicial conscience that\nthe Court  has the power, as well as the duty, to impose the\ndeath sentence. In view of these adequate safeguards, it can\nhardly be  asserted that  the sentence of death provided for\nan offence  of\tmurder\tpunishable  under  s.  302  is\t&#x27;de-\nhumanising&#x27; or that it is &#x27;unnecessary&#x27;.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_271\">     With respect,  my\tlearned\t brother  Krishna  Iyer\t J.,\ndespite his  sense of humanism, does not appear to be wholly\nan &#x27;abolitionist&#x27;.

The style\n     of violence  and systematic corruption and deliberately\n     planned economic offences by corporate top echelons are\n     often a  terrible technology of knowingly causing death\n     on a  macro scale\tto  make  a  flood  of\tprofit.\t The\n     definition of  murder will\t often apply  to  them.\t But\n     because of\t corporate power such murderous depredations\n     are  not  charged.\t If  prosecuted\t and  convicted\t for\n     murder, they  may earn  the extreme  penalty for taking\n     the lives\tof innocents  deliberately for\tastronomical\n     scales of gain.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_110\">\t  Likewise, if\ta man  is murderer,  so hardened, so\n     bloodthirsty, that\t within the  prison and\t without, he\n     makes no bones\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_95\">162</span>\n     about  killing   others  or  carries  on  a  prosperous\n     business in  cadavers, then  he becomes a candidate for\n     death sentence.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_272\">     My learned\t brother Krishna  Iyer J.  wants  the  death\npenalty to  be inflicted  in the case of three categories of\ncriminals, namely  (1) for  white-collar offences,  (2)\t for\nanti-social offences, and (3) for exterminating a person who\nis a  menace to the society, that is, a `hardened murderer&#x27;.\nEdwin H.  Stherland defines  a white-collar  offence  as  `a\ncrime in  relation to  business&#x27;. (1)The  validity of white-\ncollar crime  as a  crime  has\tbeen  a\t subject  of  severe\ncontroversy in\tsocial studies. Now `white-collar crime&#x27;, as\ncommonly understood,  means a crime committed by a person of\nrespectability and  of high  social status  in the course of\nhis occupational  role. It  takes in such forms as restraint\nof trade, mis-representation in advertising, infringement of\npatents, unfair labour practices, financial fraud, unethical\nor illegal  rebating and  violation of\ttrusts. It  may also\ntake the  form of  theft, sale\tand export  of entiques like\nsculptures, any\t work of  art of  historical value,  illegal\nsale of narcotics and alcohol, abortion, fraudulent accident\nreport, income-tax  frauds etc. An `anti-social offence&#x27; may\nconsist of  sale of spurious drugs, adulteration of articles\nof food\t meant for  human consumption,\tauto thefts, `sharp&#x27;\nbusiness practices  which do  not conform  to  the  national\nwell-being. Some  of  these  offences  must  undoubtedly  be\nruthlessly dealt  with. But  unfortunately our penal laws do\nnot provide  for a  death sentence  for either\twhite collar\ncrimes or anti-social offences, although I wish they did, at\nleast for certain anti-social offences.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_273\">     There will be general measure of agreement that some of\nthe serious  anti-social offences  call for a death sentence\nviz. acts  of sabotage\tby a  person who hijacks a plane and\nthe like  and large  number of persons die or are injured in\nconsequence, or\t disrupts lines\t of communications, or holds\nup a  train and commits armed robbery with murder inside the\ntrain. He  is a\t menace to  the society and deserves a death\nsentence, as  his existence does not conform to the national\nwell-being. Like-wise,\ta person  who indulges\tin theft  or\nillegal trade and export of art treasures such as invaluable\nmonuments, paintings and sculptures of historical importance\nand of\tpriceless antiques  of what  remains of our national\nheritage, or  in adulteration  of articles of food meant for\nhuman  consumption,  or\t in  manufacturing  and\t selling  of\nspurious drugs,\t or engages  in illegal sale in narcotics or\nalcohol, which\tare  injurious\tto  the\t very  life  of\t the\ncommunity, also\t deserves a death sentence, as in many other\ncountries, or  at any  rate a  sentence of  imprisonment for\nlife. The  same\t applies  to  economic\toffences  which\t may\ndisrupt the  economic life of the community as a whole, like\nsmuggling of gold and other contraband\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_96\">163</span>\ngoods, which  call for\ta very deterrent punishment. This is\nnecessary to protect the basic economic order of the nation.\nBut these are all matters for the Parliament to decide.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_274\">     It may  be stated\tthat the  State of  West Bengal\t has\ntaken a\t step forward  in that\tdirection. The Prevention of\nAdulteration of\t Food, Drugs  and Cosmetics  Act, 1973 (West\nBengal Act  42 of 1973 makes the offence of sale of spurious\ndrugs, adulteration  of articles  of food  meant  for  human\nconsumption etc., punishable with imprisonment for life.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_275\">     As regards `hardened&#x27; murderers, I am afraid, there are\nfew to\tbe found.  Many murders unfortunately go undetected,\nand many  a brutal  murderer has to be acquitted for want of\nlegal evidence\tbringing his  guilt  beyond  all  reasonable\ndoubt. Nevertheless,  when the\tguilt is  proved, the  Court\nshould leave  aside all humanitarian considerations, if, the\nextreme penalty\t is called  for. A  `professional&#x27;  murderer\nmust, as  a matter  of course, be sentenced to death because\nhe is  a menace\t to the society. Whatever sympathy the Court\ncan have  should be  reserved for  the victims\tof the crime\nrather than  for the  perpetrators. In\tsuch cases,  the law\nmust take its course.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_276\">     I\tdo  not\t intend\t to  enter  upon  any  philosophical\ndialectics as  to the  `utility&#x27; of  the death\tsentence  or\nenter into  the controversy  whether  it  is  `unnecessary&#x27;,\n`brutal&#x27; or  `dehumanizing&#x27;, but  I would, for my part, like\nto say, that I am of the opinion-with much deference for the\ngreat authority of those who think otherwise-that the weight\nof evidence  and reason is in favour of the retention of the\ndeath penalty.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_277\">     I am  afraid, if  the Courts  were to  be guided by the\nclassification made  by the  majority the death sentence for\nan offence  of murder  punishable  under  s.  302,  for\t all\npractical purposes would be virtually non-existent.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_278\">     I feel  that it  is not  necessary for  the purposes of\nthese appeals  to refer to the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_183\">Indian Penal Code</a> (Amendment)\nBill, 1976,  which by  s. 125 introduces a new s. 302 in the\nIndian Panel  Code, 1860.  The re-drafted  section seeks  to\nbring about  a change in the law. It abolishes the liability\nto suffer  the death  sentence on  conviction of  murder and\nsubstitutes the\t sentence of imprisonment for life by sub-s.\n(1) except  in cases of certain first degree murders falling\nwithin sub-s.  (2) thereof.  The cases\tin which  the  death\nsentence is  to be  retained are those where, in the view of\nthe Government, murder is most dangerous to the preservation\nof law\tand order, and where the death sentence is likely to\nbe a  particularly effective  deterrent,  viz.,\t pre-planned\nmurders involving  extreme brutality  and murders  involving\nexceptional depravity.\tThe Bill is not before the Court. It\nis, therefore, not proper to deal with it.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_97\">164</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_279\">     It is,  however, necessary\t to emphasise  that if there\nhas to\tbe a  law reform  at all, some regard must be had to\nthe plight  of the  victim or  his or  her family  by making\nprovision for  payment of compensation. While it is commonly\naccepted that  those convicted of violations of the criminal\nlaw must  &quot;pay their  debt to  society&quot;, little\t emphasis is\nplaced upon requiring offenders to &quot;pay their debt&quot; to their\nvictims. These\tagain are  matters  for\t the  Parliament  to\nprovide.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_280\">     From a  life time\tof experience,\tSir  John  Beaumont,\nspeaking  with\t unrivalled  authority,\t  told\t the   Royal\nCommission on  Capital Punishment(1)  that  the\t alternative\nsentence under<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_184\">\ts. 302</a>\tof the\tIndian Penal  Code 1860\t had\n&quot;worked well&quot;  in India,  and that he had never himself felt\nthat the  responsibility of choosing between the sentence of\ndeath and  a lesser  punishment was unfair or excessive, nor\nhad he ever heard any Judge in India express such a feeling.\nHe expressed  the  opinion  that  there\t was  &quot;no  class  of\noffences in  which the\tdegree of  moral culpability differs\nmore than  in case  of murder&quot;.\t It is\twholly illogical  to\nrequire a  Judge to pass the same sentence in every case. In\nhis view,  the proper  solution lies  in giving to the Judge\nthe same discretion that he had in regard to other offences.\nA large body of judicial opinion still shares the same view.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_281\">     If Parliament  thought it\tright to  give to the Judges\ndiscretion as  to the sentence, I do not think they would or\nought to  shrink from  the onerous responsibility. I feel it\nwould not be appropriate for this Court to curtail the ambit\nof their  discretion by\t judicial process.  We cannot but be\noblivious that\ta sentence  of a  wrong type,  that  is,  to\nsubstitute a  sentence of  imprisonment for  life where\t the\ndeath sentence\tis called  for, causes\tgrave miscarriage of\njustice. A  sentence or\t pattern of sentences which fails to\ntake due account of the gravity of the offence can seriously\nundermine respect for law.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_282\">     Turning to the appeals before us, I cannot say that the\naward of  death sentence  in any  of  these  cases  was\t not\nappropriate or\tuncalled for.  In the three cases before us,\nthere were  &quot;special reasons&quot;  within the meaning of s. 354,\nsub-s. (3)  of the  <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_185\">Code of Criminal Procedure</a>, 1973 for the\npassing of  the death  sentence in  each and  therefore, the\nHigh Courts were justified in confirming the death sentences\npassed, under  368(a) of the Code. In the circumstances, any\ninterference with  the sentence\t of death, in my view, would\nbe wholly unwarranted in each of these cases.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_98\">165</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_283\">     In Rajendra Prasad&#x27;s case, the Allabhabad High Court in\nconfirming the\tdeath sentence\tobserves  that\tthe  accused\nRajendra is  a `desperate  character&#x27;, who after having been\nconvicted  under   s.  302   and  undergone  a\tsentence  of\nimprisonment for  life was released only a few days prior to\nthe occurrence, on October 2, 1972, that is, on the occasion\nof Gandhi  Jayanti,  committed\tthe  brutal  murder  of\t the\ndeceased Mansukh by striking him with a knife.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_284\">     On the  date of  occurrence, that\tis, on\tOctober\t 25,\n1972, at  about 11  a.m. the  accused along with his brother\nPooran rushed  towards Sri  Kishan, brother  of Rambharosay,\narmed with  a knife but Sri Kishan ran to safety and was not\nhurt. Later in the evening at about 5.30 p.m., the same day,\nwhile Rambharosay  and the deceased Mansukh were standing in\nthe lane  in  front  of\t Rambharosay&#x27;s\thouse,\tthe  accused\nsuddenly appeared  and dealt several blows with the knife on\nvital parts  of the  body  of  Rambharosay  but\t Rambharosay\nreleased himself  from his grip and ran inside his house and\nbolted the door. The accused chased him all the way with the\nblood-stained knife  and knocked  at the  door asking him to\nopen it.  Meanwhile, the  deceased Mansukh came and tried to\nentreat the  accused not  to assault  Rambharosay. Thereupon\nthe accused  struck deceased  Mansukh, who  tried to escape,\nbut the\t accused chased\t him over  a distance  of 200 to 250\nfeet and  inflicted repeated  knife blows  on  the  deceased\nresulting in  his death.  The deceased\twas done to death by\nthe accused  merely because  he tried  to prevent  him\tfrom\nassaulting Rambharosay.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_285\">     Not only there are no mitigating circumstances but this\nwas a  pre-planned, cold-blooded  murder. While Rajendra was\nin jail,  his family members used to wield out a threat that\nthe members of the family of Rambharosay would be dealt with\nafter Rajendra is released from jail.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_286\">     The case  of this\taccused is destructive of the theory\nof reformation.\t The `therapeutic touch&#x27; which it is said is\nthe best  way of  preventing repetition\t of the\t offence has\nbeen of\t no avail.  Punishment must  be designed  so  as  to\ndeter, as  far\tas  possible,  from  commission\t of  similar\noffences. It should also serve as a warning to other members\nof society.  In both respects, the experiment of reformation\nhas  miserably\tfailed.\t I  am\tquite  sure  that  with\t the\ncommutation of his death sentence, the accused will commit a\nfew more  murders and  he would again become a menace to the\ncommunity.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_287\">     In Kunjukunju Janardhanan&#x27;s case, the Kerala High Court\nwhile confirming  the death sentence of the accused observes\nthat he\t acted, with  extreme depravity.  Infatuated by\t the\ncharm of a village girl, Smt.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_99\">166</span>\nSanthamma, then\t aged about 21 years, the accused Kunjukunju\nJanardhanan, aged  28 years,  committed the brutal murder of\nhis innocent  wife, Smt. Chandramathi, aged 26 years and his\ntwo minor sons, Sunil aged 7 and Manoj aged 5 at the dead of\nnight while they were sleep by repeatedly striking them with\na sharp-edged  deadly weapon.  It redounds  to the credit of\nSmt. Santhamma,\t P.W. 2,  the village  girl, with  whom\t the\naccused was  on terms  of illicit intimacy, that she used to\nentreat him  in her  letters not  to court  her as  it would\ndestroy the  happiness of  his family.\tIt was then that the\naccused\t wrote\t the  letter,\tExt.  P-2,   that  he  would\nexterminate his\t wife and  children once  for all so that he\nmay live happily with her.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_288\">     I fail  to understand  what is  meant by  the  `eternal\ntriangle&#x27; as  a mitigating  circumstance. The  accused,\t who\nacted as  a monster,  did not  even spare  his two  innocent\nminor children\tin order  to get  rid of his wife and issues\nthrough her.  If the death sentence was not to be awarded in\na case\tlike this  I do\t not see  the type  of offence which\ncalls for a death sentence.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_289\">     In Sheo  Shankar Dubey&#x27;s case, the Allahabad High Court\nhas found  the accused\tSheo Shankar guilty of triple murder\nand rightly  confirmed the  sentence of death passed on him.\nThe accused  Sheo Shankar murdered his uncle Narottam Dubey,\nand his two sons Chandra Bhushan and Chandra Shekher.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_290\">     On the date of occurrence, i.e., on June 15, 1976 after\nthere was  a partition of the joint family lands between the\ndeceased Narottam  and Purushottam,  father of\tthe  accused\nSheo Shankar,  there was  a dispute  regarding\tdivision  of\nthree bataulis.\t The three  bataulis could  not\t be  equally\ndivided because\t they were  of different  sizes. The accused\ninsisted that  they should  be broken  and then partitioned.\nSmt. Vidyawati\twidow of  Narottam, in\tfact, in  trying  to\npacify\ther  brother-in-law  Purushottam,  brought  out\t one\nbatauli and  the remaining  two were  taken out\t by  Chandra\nShekhar. It  all happened over the act of Chandra Shekher in\nflinging the  two bataulis  on\tthe  ground  which  collided\nmaking a  sound showing\t his resentment.  The expression  of\nresentment  implicit  in  the  gesture\tof  Chandra  Shekhar\ninfuriated the\taccused Sheo  Shankar to such an extent that\nhe committed  the three murders in a row. These were nothing\nbut first-degree murders.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_291\">     The weapon used by the accused in committing the crime,\nthe manner  in which  the operation was carried out, and the\ndetermination with  which the  accused acted, as well as the\nnumber of  injuries inflicted  on the  unfortunate  victims,\ngive a clear picture of the cruelty and brutality\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_100\">167</span>\nwith which  the accused murdered his uncle and his two sons.\nHe first  inflicted a knife blow on his uncle Narottam Dubey\nwho tried  to run  away and  as he turned, the accused dealt\nhim another  knife blow\t resulting in his death on the spot.\nNarottam Dubey,\t it appears,  attempted his  best to escape.\nEven after  he had  sustained bleeding injuries at the hands\nof the\taccused, he  made an  effort to\t run away but he was\nchased by  the accused\tand the\t accused finished the victim\nwith grim determination. His cousin Chandra Bhushan tried to\nintercept with a view to protect the life of his aged father\nbut he was even not spared by the accused who struck a fatal\nblow on\t the chest.  The second cousin, Chandra Shekher, who\nmoved forward  to save his brother was chased by the accused\nwho also  finished him\tof by a stroke of the blade of knife\nhe wielded.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_292\">     It was  no doubt  a trifling incident over the division\nof three betaulis resulting in the triple murder. It is said\nthat the  murders were\tnot `pre-meditated&#x27; but committed in\nthe heat  of passion  over a  `family feud&#x27;. But that hardly\nfurnishes a  justification for\tthe extreme  brutality\twith\nwhich the accused acted.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_293\">     There is  no inexorable  rule that\t either the  extreme\nyouth of  the accused or the fact that he acted in a heat of\npassion must  always irrespective  of the  enormity  of\t the\noffence or  otherwise be  treated as a sufficient ground for\nawarding the  lesser punishment.  The Court has to take into\nconsideration all  the circumstances  which do not merit the\nextreme penalty.  I find that in the facts and circumstances\nof this particular case, these factors cannot outweigh other\nconsiderations. Three  precious lives  have been lost by the\ndastardly act of the accused. A family has been wiped off.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_294\">     The death sentence was clearly called for in this case-\nfirstly,  as   a  threat   or  warning\tto  deter  potential\nmurderers,  and\t secondly,  as\tthe  guarantee\tagainst\t the\nbrutalisation of human nature. The grim determination of the\naccused to  bring the entire operation to the end desired by\nhim is\talso reflected\tin the\tmanner of  his repelling the\ninterception of\t Chandra Bhushan  who went  to the rescue of\nhis father  and Chandra\t Shekher who  tried  to\t rescue\t his\nbrother Chandra\t Bhushan, the  unfortunate  victims  of\t the\nmurderous assault.  All these facts and circumstances, to my\nmind, constitute `special reasons&#x27; why the accused should be\nsentenced to death.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_295\">     In retrospect,  I venture to say that in these appeals,\nit cannot  be asserted\tthat the  award of death sentence to\nthe appellants\twas `erroneous\tin principle&#x27;. Nor can it be\nsaid that the sentence of death passed on them was arbitrary\nor excessive  or  indicative  of  an  improper\texercise  of\ndiscretion. It\tis the\tduty of the Court to impose a proper\npunishment,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_101\">168</span>\ndepending upon the degree of criminality and desirability to\nimpose such  punishment as a measure of social necessity, as\na means\t of deterring  other potential offenders. Failure to\nimpose a  death sentence  in such  grave cases where it is a\ncrime against  the society-particularly\t in cases of murders\ncommitted with\textreme brutality,  will bring to nought the\nsentence of  death provided  by<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_186\"> s.  302</a> of  the Indian Penal\nCode, 1860.  To allow  the appellants  to  escape  with\t the\nlesser punishment after they had committed such intentional,\ncold-blooded, deliberate and brutal murders will deprive the\nlaw of its effectiveness and result in travesty of justice.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_296\">     I would,  therefore,  for\tthese  reasons\tdismiss\t the\nappeals. The appellants are at liberty to apply for reprieve\nfor commutation\t of their sentence which is an executive act\nof clemency.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_297\">\t\t\t   ORDER\n     In the  light of  the opinion of the majority the death\nsentence in  each of these appeals is commuted to a sentence\nof imprisonment for life.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_298\">P.B.R.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_102\">169</span>\n\n\n\n</p>",
