The short question that falls for  consideration  in  this  appeal  by\nspecial leave is whether the trial Court was justified in framing  a  charge\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 302</a> of the IPC against the appellants  and  whether  the  High\nCourt was  justified  in  affirming  that  order  of  the  trial  Court  and\ndismissing the writ petition filed  by  the  writ  petitioners  against  the\nsame.  The question arises in the following background.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">3.    FIR No.  765/2007  was  registered  against  the  appellants  alleging\ncommission of offences punishable under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_2\">Sections  498A</a>, <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_3\">304-B</a>,  <a href=\"/doc/988620/\" id=\"a_4\">406</a>  and  <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_5\">34</a>\nof IPC in connection with the  demise  in  unnatural  circumstances  of  Ms.\nChandni wife of appellant No.1-Mr. Jasvinder Saini. The case was  registered\non a complaint filed Ajay Gautam, father of the deceased.   The  matter  was\ninvestigated and a charge sheet filed before the  Jurisdictional  Magistrate\nalleging commission of offences mentioned above against the appellants 1  to\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_5\">4. A supplementary charge sheet followed in which appellants  5  to  8  were\nalso implicated in the case to which <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_6\">Section  302</a>  was  also  added  by  the\nInvestigating Officer.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">4.    The case was soon committed  to  the  Sessions  and  assigned  to  the\nAdditional Sessions Judge, Rohini, Delhi, who heard the matter  for  framing\nof charges and came  to  the  conclusion  that  there  was  no  evidence  or\nmaterial on record to justify framing of a charge  under  <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_7\">Section  302</a>  IPC.\nCharges were accordingly framed against the appellants under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_8\">Sections  498A</a>,\n<a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_9\">304B</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 34</a> IPC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_7\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"190567599\" id=\"span_1\">5.    At the  trial  the  prosecution  had  examined  as  many  as  eighteen\nwitnesses, when a two-Judges Bench of this Court passed  an  order  on  22nd\nNovember 2010 in <a href=\"/doc/190567599/\" id=\"a_11\">Rajibir @ Raju &amp; Anr. v. State of Haryana</a> AIR 2011  SC  568\nby which this Court directed all trial Courts in India to  add  <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_12\">Section  302</a>\nin every case alleging commission of an  offence  punishable  under  <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_13\">Section\n304B</a> of the IPC. This direction, it appears, came  because  the  Court  felt\nstrongly about the commission of heinous and barbaric crimes  against  women\nin the country.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_8\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"190567599\" id=\"span_2\">6.    In Rajbir’s case  (supra)  the  appellant  had  been  convicted  under\n<a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 304-B</a> IPC and sentenced to imprisonment for life by the trial  Court\napart from offences under other  sections.  The  High  Court  had,  however,\nreduced the sentence to ten years rigorous imprisonment in so far as  Rajbir\nwas concerned and to two years rigorous imprisonment  in  the  case  of  his\nmother Appellant No.2 <a href=\"/doc/190567599/\" id=\"a_15\">in that case</a>.  This Court on a prima facie basis  felt\nthat the reduction in the  sentence  was  not  justified.</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1149159\" id=\"span_3\">Relying  upon  an\nearlier decision rendered in <a href=\"/doc/1149159/\" id=\"a_16\">Satya Narayan Tiwari @ Jolly  &amp; Anr.  v.  State\nof U.P.</a> (2010) 13 SCC 689, Criminal Appeal No.1168 of 2005 decided  on  28th\nOctober, 2010 this Court issued notice to  Rajbir  to  show  cause  why  his\nsentence be not enhanced to  life  imprisonment  as  awarded  by  the  trial\nCourt.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_9\">7.    It was in the above background, that this Court  in  para  11  of  the\ninterim order passed by it  directed  all  the  trial  Courts  in  India  to\nordinarily add <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 302</a> to the charge under <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 304B</a>  “so that  death\nsentences could be imposed in  such  heinous  and  barbaric  crimes  against\nwomen.” Para 11 may be extracted at this stage:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">                 “We further direct all trial Courts in India to  ordinarily\n           add <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 302</a> to the charge of <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_20\">Section  304B</a>,  so  that  death\n           sentences can be imposed in such  heinous  and  barbaric  crimes\n           against women.”\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">8.    In the case at hand the trial Court noticed the  above  direction  and\nconsidering itself duty bound to abide by the  same  added  a  charge  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 302</a> IPC to the one already  framed  against  the  appellant.   While\ndoing so, the trial  Court  simply  <a href=\"/doc/1149159/\" id=\"a_22\">placed  reliance  upon</a>  <a href=\"/doc/1172704/\" id=\"a_23\">Section  216</a>  of\nCr.P.C. which empowers the Court to add or alter the  charge  at  any  stage\nand the direction of this Court in Rajbir’s case (supra).  This  is  evident\nfrom the following passage from the order passed by the trial Court:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">                 <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1507723\" id=\"span_4\">“… I have considered the submissions made before me.  It is\n           settled law that charges can be modified/amended at any stage of\n           the proceedings and even if at the initial stage the Court is of\n           the view that there is no material for framing the charge  under\n           <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 302</a> IPC.  The same can be  added/altered  at  any  later\n           stage (<a href=\"/doc/1172704/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 216</a> Cr.P.C.) which cannot be termed as  a  review\n           of the earlier order.  Even otherwise,  the  directions  of  the\n           Hon’ble Apex Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1507723/\" id=\"a_26\">Rajbir @ Raju &amp; Anr. Vs. State\n           of Haryana</a> in  Special  Leave  Petition  bearing  No.  9507/2010\n           decided  on  22-11-2010  duly   circulated   vide   No.   33760-\n           69/DHC/Gaz/G-X/SCJ/2010  dated  3-12-2010,  specific  directions\n           have been issued to all  the  subordinate  Courts  in  India  to\n           ordinarily add <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 302</a> IPC to the charge under <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_28\">Section  304B</a>\n           IPC.</span>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">                 Therefore, this being the background, charge under  <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_29\">Section\n           302</a> IPC is being  framed  in  alternative  against  the  accused\n           persons against whom charge under <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 304  B  </a>IPC  had  been\n           framed.  The accused pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.”\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">9.    Aggrieved  by  the  above  direction,  the  appellant  preferred  Writ\nPetition (Crl.) No.413 of 2011 before the High Court of Delhi  which  failed\nand was dismissed by the High Court in terms of the order  impugned  in  the\npresent appeal.  Placing reliance upon  <a href=\"/doc/1172704/\" id=\"a_31\">Section  216</a>  of  Cr.P.C.  the  High\nCourt observed that appearance of additional evidence at the trial  was  not\nessential for framing of an additional charge or altering a  charge  already\nframed though it may be one of the grounds to do so. The  High  Court  apart\nfrom placing reliance upon the order passed by this Court in  Rajbir’s  case\n(supra) held that a perusal of the Autopsy Surgeon’s Report  provided  prima\nfacie evidence to the effect that  the  death  of  the  deceased  “could  be\nhomicidal” in nature and that the earlier order passed by  the  trial  Court\nholding that no case for offence under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 302</a> IPC was made out did  not\nconstitute any impediment for the trial Court to take a different view at  a\nlater stage. The  present  appeal  assails  the  correctness  of  the  above\norders.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_12\">10.   <a href=\"/doc/1172704/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 216</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure  deals  with  alteration\nor addition of any charge and empowers the  Court  to  do  so  at  any  time\nbefore the judgment is pronounced.  The section runs as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">           “216.  Court may alter charge –\n\n           (1) Any Court may alter or add to any charge at any time  before\n           judgment is pronounced.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">           (2)  Every  such  alteration  or  addition  shall  be  read  and\n           explained to the accused.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">           (3) If the alteration or addition  to  a  charge  is  such  that\n           proceeding immediately with the trial  is  not  likely,  in  the\n           opinion of the Court, to prejudice the accused in his defense or\n           the prosecutor in the conduct of the case, the Court may, in its\n           discretion, after such alteration or  addition  has  been  made,\n           proceed with the trial as if the altered  or  added  charge  had\n           been the original charge.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">           (4) If the  alteration  or  addition  is  such  that  proceeding\n           immediately with the trial is likely,  in  the  opinion  of  the\n           Court, to prejudice the accused or the prosecutor as  aforesaid,\n           the Court may either direct a new trial or adjourn the trial for\n           such period as may be necessary.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">           (5) If the offence stated in the altered or added charge is  one\n           for the prosecution of which previous sanction is necessary, the\n           case  shall  not  be  proceeded  with  until  such  sanction  is\n           obtained, unless  sanction  has  been  already  obtained  for  a\n           prosecution on the same facts as those on which the  altered  or\n           added charge is founded.”\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">11.   A plain reading of the above would show  that  the  Court’s  power  to\nalter or add any  charge  is  unrestrained  provided  such  addition  and/or\nalteration is made before the judgment is pronounced.  Sub-sections  (2)  to\n(5) of <a href=\"/doc/1865807/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 216</a> deal with the procedure to be  followed  once  the  Court\ndecides to alter or add any charge. <a href=\"/doc/1441158/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 217</a> of the Code deals  with  the\nrecall of witnesses when the charge is altered or added by the  Court  after\ncommencement of the trial.  There can in the light of the above be no  doubt\nabout the competence of the Court to add or  alter  a  charge  at  any  time\nbefore the judgment. The circumstances in which such addition or  alteration\nmay be made are not, however, stipulated in <a href=\"/doc/1865807/\" id=\"a_36\">Section  216</a>.   It  is  all  the\nsame trite that the question of  any  such  addition  or  alternation  would\ngenerally arise either because the Court finds the charge already framed  to\nbe  defective  for  any  reason  or  because  such  addition  is  considered\nnecessary after the commencement of the trial having regard to the  evidence\nthat may come before the Court. In the case at hand the  evidence  assembled\nin the course of the investigation and presented to the trial Court was  not\nfound sufficient to call for framing a charge under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_37\">Section  302</a>  IPC.   The\ntrial Court recorded a specific finding to that effect in  its  order  dated\n18th March 2009 while framing charges  against  the  appellants  before  us.\nThe trial Court said:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">                 “The two witnesses Kiran Devi and Smt. Dharam Kaur were  at\n           the spot when the deceased fell down from the second  floor  and\n           did not notice anyone on the roof of the house. Thus there is no\n           material for framing of charge Under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 302</a> IPC against the\n           accused persons.  However, there  are  specific  allegations  of\n           dowry demand and torture in the  statement  given  by  Sh.  Ajay\n           Gautam to the SDM and as also in the  statements  given  by  his\n           wife Manisha Gautam and his son Vishal Gautam. The deceased  had\n           died under unnatural circumstances. Her death took place at  her\n           matrimonial home within seven years of her marriage.  There is a\n           presumption Under <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 113-B</a> of the Indian  Evidence  Act  of\n           dowry death.  Hence on the basis of material on record, I am  of\n           the view that prima facie offence Under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 498A</a>/<a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_41\">304B</a>/<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_42\">34</a> IPC\n           is made out against all the accused persons.”\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">12.   A reading of the order which the trial Court  subsequently  passed  on\n23rd February 2011 directing addition of a  charge  under  <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_43\">Section  302</a>  IPC\nmakes it abundantly clear that the addition was not based on  any  error  or\nomission whether inadvertent or otherwise in the matter of  framing  charges\nagainst the accused. Even the respondents did not plead  that  the  omission\nof a charge under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 302</a> IPC was  on  account  of  any  inadvertent  or\nother error or omission on the part of the trial Court.   The  order  passed\nby the trial Court, on the contrary directed addition of  the  charge  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 302</a> IPC entirely in obedience to the direction issued by this  Court\nin Rajbir’s case (supra). Such being the position when the order  passed  by\nthe trial Court was challenged before the High Court the only question  that\nfell for determination was whether the addition of a  charge  under  <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_46\">Section\n302</a> IPC was justified on the basis of the direction issued by this Court  in\nRajbir’s case (supra).  The High Court has no doubt adverted to that  aspect\nand found itself to be duty bound to comply with the direction in  the  same\nmeasure as the trial Court.  Having said so, it has gone a step  further  to\nsuggest that the autopsy surgeon’s report was prima facie evidence  to  show\nthat the offence was homicidal in nature.  The High Court has  by  doing  so\nprovided an additional reason to justify  the  framing  of  a  charge  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 302</a> IPC.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_15\">13.   Be that as it may the common thread running through  both  the  orders\nis that this Court had in Rajbir’s case (supra) directed the addition  of  a\ncharge under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_48\">Section 302</a> IPC to every case in which the accused are  charged\nwith Section 304-B.  That was not, in our opinion, the true purport  of  the\norder passed by this Court.  The direction was  not  meant  to  be  followed\nmechanically and without due regard to the nature of the evidence  available\nin the case.  All that this Court meant to say was that in a  case  where  a\ncharge alleging dowry death is framed, a charge under Section 302  can  also\nbe framed if the evidence otherwise  permits.  No  other  meaning  could  be\ndeduced from the order of this Court.  It is common  ground  that  a  charge\nunder <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_49\">Section  304B</a>  IPC  is  not  a  substitute  for  a  charge  of  murder\npunishable under Section 302.  As in the case of murder in every case  under\nSection 304B also there is a death involved.  The  question  whether  it  is\nmurder punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_50\">Section 302</a> IPC or a dowry  death  punishable  under\n<a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 304B</a> IPC depends upon the fact situation and  the  evidence  in  the\ncase. If there is evidence whether direct or circumstantial to  prima  facie\nsupport a charge under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 302</a> IPC the trial Court can and indeed  ought\nto frame a charge of murder punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_53\">Section 302</a>  IPC,  which  would\nthen be the main charge and not an  alternative  charge  as  is  erroneously\nassumed in some quarters.  If the  main  charge  of  murder  is  not  proved\nagainst the accused at the trial, the Court can look into  the  evidence  to\ndetermine whether the alternative charge of  dowry  death  punishable  under\nSection 304B is established. The ingredients constituting the  two  offences\nare  different,  thereby  demanding  appreciation  of  evidence   from   the\nperspective relevant to such ingredients. The trial Court in  that  view  of\nthe matter acted mechanically for  it  framed  an  additional  charge  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_54\">Section 302</a> IPC without adverting to the evidence adduced in  the  case  and\nsimply on the basis of the direction issued in Rajbir’s case  (supra).   The\nHigh Court no doubt made a half hearted attempt to justify  the  framing  of\nthe charge independent of the directions in Rajbir’s case  (supra),  but  it\nwould have been more appropriate to remit  the  matter  back  to  the  trial\nCourt for fresh orders rather than lending support to it in the manner  done\nby the High Court.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1830378\" id=\"span_5\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"302799\" id=\"span_6\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1309857\" id=\"span_7\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1445805\" id=\"span_8\">14.   In the light of what we have said  above,  the  order  passed  by  the\ntrial Court and so also that passed by the High Court are clearly  untenable\nand shall have to be set aside. That would not, however, prevent  the  trial\nCourt from re-examining the question of framing a charge under  <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_55\">Section  302</a>\nIPC against the appellant and passing an appropriate order if upon  a  prima\nfacie appraisal of the evidence adduced before it, the trial Court comes  to\nthe conclusion that there is any room for doing so. The  trial  Court  would\nin that regard keep  in  view  the  decision  of  this  Court  in  <a href=\"/doc/1445805/\" id=\"a_56\">Hasanbhai\nValibhai Qureshi v. State of Gujarat and Ors.</a> (2004) 5 SCC  347  where  this\nCourt has recognized the principle that in cases where the trial Court  upon\na consideration of broad probabilities of the case based upon  total  effect\nof the evidence and documents produced, is satisfied that  any  addition  or\nalteration of the charge is necessary, it is free to do  so.  Reference  may\nalso be made to the decisions of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1309857/\" id=\"a_57\">Ishwarchand Amichand  Govadia\nand Ors. v. State of  Maharashtra  and  Anr.</a>  (2006)  10  SCC  322  and  the\ndecision of the Calcutta High Court in <a href=\"/doc/302799/\" id=\"a_58\">Rajendra Singh Sethia  v.  State  and\nOrs.</a> 1989 Cri.L.J. 255 and that delivered by the  Allahabad  High  Court  in\n<a href=\"/doc/1830378/\" id=\"a_59\">Shiv Nandan and Ors. v. State of U.P.</a> 2005 Cri. L.J 3047 which  too  are  to\nthe same effect.  In any such fresh  exercise  which  the  trial  Court  may\nundertake, it shall remain uninfluenced by  the  observations  made  by  the\nHigh Court on merits of the case  including  those  touching  the  probative\nvalue of the autopsy surgeon’s opinion.</span></span></span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_17\">15.   In the result, we allow this appeal, set aside  the  order  passed  by\nthe High Court and that passed by the trial Court framing the  charge  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_60\">Section 302</a> IPC and remit the matter back to the trial  Court  for  a  fresh\norder keeping in view the observations made above.  No costs.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">                       ……………………...…………………...…J.\n                       (T.S.
