RADHAKRISHNAN, J.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_2\">1.    We are in this case concerned with the  question  as  to  whether  the\nrelationship between A-1  and  A-2  was  extra-marital  leading  to  cruelty\nwithin the meaning of  <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_1\">Section  498A</a>  IPC  and  also  amounted  to  abetment\nleading to the act of suicide within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 306</a> IPC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_3\">2.    A-1, the first accused, along with A-2 and  A-3,  were  charge-sheeted\nfor the offences punishable under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_3\">Sections 498A</a>, <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_4\">304-B</a>  and  <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_5\">306</a>  IPC.   The\nSessions Court convicted A-1 for the offence punishable under  <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_6\">Section  498A</a>\nIPC and sentenced him to suffer RI for three years and  to  pay  a  fine  of\nRs.5,000/- and in default to undergo further RI  for  six  months.  A-1  was\nalso convicted for offence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 306</a>  IPC  and  sentenced\nto suffer RI for 10 years and to pay a fine of Rs.5,000/- and in default  to\nundergo further RI for six months.  A-2 and A-3, the  mother  of  A-1  were,\nhowever, acquitted of the various offences alleged against them.  The  trial\nCourt also acquitted A-1 of the offence charged against  him  under  <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_8\">Section\n304-B</a>  IPC.   On  appeal  by  A-1,  the  High  Court  though  confirmed  the\nconviction, modified the sentence under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 498A</a> IPC to  two  years’  RI\nand a fine of Rs.2,500/- and in  default  to  undergo  further  RI  for  six\nmonths, and for the offence under <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 306</a> IPC, the sentence was  reduced\nto RI for five years and to pay a fine  of  Rs.5,000/-  and  in  default  to\nundergo RI for one year.  It  was  ordered  that  the  sentences  would  run\nconcurrently.  Aggrieved by the judgment of the High Court, this appeal  has\nbeen preferred by A-1.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_4\">3.    Shri Sanjay  Visen,  learned  counsel  appearing  for  the  Appellant,\nsubmitted that the allegations raised against the accused in respect of  the\nalleged extra-marital relationship with second accused would not  constitute\nan offence under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 498A</a> IPC.  Learned counsel also submitted that  the\nsuicidal death of the deceased was not a direct result of the alleged extra-\nmarital relationship and would not constitute an  offence  punishable  under\n<a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 306</a> IPC.  Learned counsel also submitted  that  even  assuming  that\nthe Appellant was maintaining extra-marital  relationship  with  the  second\naccused, there is no mens rea proved to  show  that  such  relationship  was\nmaintained by the accused with an intention to drive the deceased to  commit\nsuicide.  Placing reliance upon the  suicide  note  Ex.44,  learned  counsel\nsubmitted that the deceased did not allege any cruelty or harassment on  the\npart of the accused which led  the  deceased  to  commit  suicide.   Learned\ncounsel submitted that in any view,  the  conduct  of  the  accused  or  the\nalleged relationship he had with A-2 was not of such  a  degree  that  would\nincite/provoke or push the deceased to a  depressed  situation  to  end  her\nlife.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_5\">4.    Mrs. Sumita Hazarika, learned counsel appearing for the State, on  the\nother hand submitted that extra-marital relationship between the  first  and\nsecond accused was of such a degree to disturb the  mental  balance  of  the\ndeceased, which amounted to cruelty within the explanation to  <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_13\">Section  498A</a>\nIPC.  Referring to various letters written by the deceased  to  her  father,\nlearned counsel pointed out that those  letters  would  clearly  depict  the\ntrauma undergone by her, which  ultimately  drove  her  to  commit  suicide.\nLearned counsel also referred to the latter part of  the  suicide  note  and\nsubmitted that the same would indicate that A-1 and A-2  were  in  love  and\nthat A-1 wanted to marry A-2  and  it  was  for  their  happiness  that  the\ndeceased committed suicide.   Learned  counsel  submitted  that  the  Courts\nbelow have correctly appreciated the documentary as well  as  oral  evidence\nof this case, which calls for no interference by this Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">5.    We may before  examining  the  various  legal  issues  refer  to  some\nrelevant facts.  A-1 married the deceased in the year -1989 and was  leading\na happy married life.  A-1 while working as a  Field  Officer  in  the  Life\nInsurance Corporation of India came into contact  with  A-2,  who  was  then\nunmarried and a colleague, working with him  in  the  Corporation.  Official\nrelationship and contacts developed into an  intimacy,  which  according  to\nthe  prosecution,  was  “extra  marital”.  Due   to   this   extra   marital\nrelationship, the  deceased,  the  wife  of  A-1,  developed  a  feeling  of\nalienation, loss of companionship,  etc.,  which  ultimately  drove  her  to\ncommit suicide on 18.3.1996 by leaping out of the terrace of a flat  leaving\na suicide note Ex.44.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_7\">6.    Prosecution in order to establish its case examined altogether  eleven\nwitnesses and produced twenty two documents.  Prosecution, however, was  not\nsuccessful in proving that A-1 or A-3 had  caused  any  physical  or  mental\nharassment to the deceased demanding dowry.  A-3, the  mother  of  A-1,  was\nacquitted of the charge and no evidence whatsoever was adduced to show  that\nA-1 had also caused any harassment physically or mentally  demanding  dowry.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">Prosecution story entirely rests on the nature of relationship A-1 had  with\nA-2.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">7.     The  prosecution  in  order  to  prove  the  relationship  as  “extra\nmarital”, made reference to few letters exchanged between the  deceased  and\nher father.  Ex.27 is letter of the deceased  written  on  2.7.1993  to  her\nfather informing him about the relationship A-1 had  with  A-2,  which  also\ndisclosed that the father of A-1 had gone to  the  house  of  A-2  twice  to\npersuade A-2 to withdraw from that relationship and advised  early  marriage\nfor A-2. Ex.28 is another letter dated 5.7.1993, addressed by  the  deceased\nto her father, wherein she had stated that she had also gone  to  the  house\nof A-2 and told her that she was prepared to part with her husband  A-1  and\nthat A-2 had told  her  that  deceased  had  blindly  placed  faith  on  her\nhusband.    Prosecution  also  made  reference  to   Ex.29,   letter   dated\n26.7.1993, wherein the deceased had again made a complaint to her father  of\nthe continued relationship of A-1 and A-2.   Ex.30  is  yet  another  letter\ndated 6.8.1993 written by the deceased again to  her  parents,  wherein  she\nhad indicated that even her father-in-law was fed up with the attitude of A-\n1 and that often he used to come to the house late in the night.   Reference\nwas made to another letter Ex.31 dated 17.8.1993 written by the deceased  to\nher parents wherein also she had made grievance against the behavior of  A-1\nand the steps taken by the father-in-law to mend the ways  of  A-1.   Letter\nalso indicated that A-1 had made a suggestion to include A-2 also  in  their\nlife, which she opposed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\">8.    Prosecution stand is that the above mentioned letters  would  disclose\nthe feelings and sufferings of an unfortunate wife having come  to  know  of\nthe love affair between  her  husband  A-1  and  his  colleague  A-2,  which\nultimately led her to commit the act of suicide.  Further, it  is  also  the\nstand of the prosecution that  the  deceased  died  within  seven  years  of\nmarriage and hence under <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 113A</a> of the Evidence  Act,  the  Court  can\npresume, having regard to all other circumstances of  the  case,  that  such\nsuicide had been abetted by the husband.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">9.    We have to examine the question as to whether A-1  is  guilty  or  not\nunder Section 498A and <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 306</a> IPC, in the light of the  fact  that  A-2\nwas already found not guilty of  the  charges  levelled  against  her  under\nSections 498A, 306 and 304-B read with <a href=\"/doc/112749/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 114</a> IPC.  Further, the  Court\nhas recorded a clear finding  that  the  prosecution  could  not  prove  any\nimmoral or illegal  relationship  between  A-1  and  A-2  or  that  A-1  had\ntortured mentally or physically his wife demanding  dowry.   Further,  there\nis also a clear finding of the trial Court that A-2 had not  contributed  or\ncaused any mental harassment to the deceased so as to drive  her  to  commit\nthe act of suicide.  Further, the  facts  would  disclose  that  during  the\nperiod of  alleged  intimacy  between  A-1  and  A-2,  A-2  got  married  in\nNovember, 1993.  Prosecution story is that the intimacy between A-1 and  A-2\ndeveloped  years  prior  to  that  and,  of  course,  if  the  intimacy   or\nrelationship between A-1 and A-2 was so strong, then A-2 would not have  got\nmarried in November,  1993.   During  the  period  of  alleged  relationship\nbetween A-1 and A-2,  it  is  pertinent  to  note  that  the  deceased   got\npregnant twice, once in the year 1992,  which  was  aborted,  and  the  year\nfollowing when the wife delivered a baby girl, which unfortunately died  two\ndays after her birth.  Prosecution has not alleged any hand  or  involvement\non the part of A-1 on such abortion.  Facts indicate that both A-1  and  the\ndeceased were staying under the same roof and that A-1 was  discharging  his\nmarital obligations and was leading a normal married life.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_12\">10.   A-1 had not caused any physical or mental  torture  on  the  deceased,\nbut for the alleged relationship  between  A-1  and  A-2.   Parents  of  the\ndeceased also did not make any allegation against A-1  of  ill-treatment  of\nwife or of dowry demand.  Possibly, he might have caught up in  a  one-sided\nlove affair with some liking towards A-2.  Can it be branded as  an  “extra-\nmarital affair” of that degree to  fall  within  the  expression  “cruelty”?\nExtra-marital affair is a term which has not  been  defined  in  the  <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_17\">Indian\nPenal Code</a> and rightly not ventured since to give a clear definition of  the\nterm is difficult, as the situation may change from case to case.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_13\">ALIENATION OF AFFECTION\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">11.   We are not prepared to say that there was  any  willful  or  malicious\ninterference by  A-2  in  the  marital  relationship  between  A-1  and  the\ndeceased.   A-2, it has not been proved, had in any way caused any  kind  of\nmental harassment by maintaining any relationship with A-1 so  as  to  cause\nany emotional distress on the deceased.  No evidence  had  been  adduced  or\nproved to show that A-2 had alienated A-1, the husband  from  the  deceased.\nFurther, no evidence had been adduced to  show  that  due  to  the  wrongful\nconduct of A-2,  the  deceased  had  lost  companionship,  affection,  love,\nsexual relationship.  No evidence has been adduced to show  that  there  has\nbeen any attempt on the part of A-2  to  disrupt  the  marital  relationship\nbetween A-1 and the deceased.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">12.   Alienation of affection by a stranger, if proved,  is  an  intentional\ntort i.e. interference in the marital relationship with intent  to  alienate\none spouse from the other.  Alienation  of  affection  is  known  as  “Heart\nBalm” action.   Anglo-Saxon common law on alienation of  affection  has  not\nmuch roots in this country, the law is still in its nascent stage.    Anglo-\nSaxon based action against third  parties  involving  tortuous  interference\nwith the marital relationship was mainly compensatory in  nature  which  was\nearlier available to the husband, but, of late, a wife could also  lay  such\na claim complaining of alienation of affection.   The object is to  preserve\nmarital harmony by deterring wrongful  interference,  thereby  to  save  the\ninstitution of marriage.  Both the spouses have a valuable interest  in  the\nmarried  relationship,  including  its  intimacy,  companionship,   support,\nduties, affection, welfare of children etc.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">13.   We notice, in this country, if the marital  relationship  is  strained\nand if the wife lives separately due to valid reasons, the wife  can  lay  a\nclaim only for maintenance against the husband  and  if  a  third  party  is\ninstrumental  for  disrupting  her  marriage,  by  alienating  her  spouse’s\naffection, companionship, including marital  obligations,  seldom,  we  find\nthe disgusted spouse proceeds against  the  intruder  into  her  matrimonial\nhome.  Possibly, in a given case, she could question the extent,  that  such\ninjuries can be adequately  compensated,  by  a  monetary  award.   Such  an\naction, of course, may not protect a marriage, but it compensates those  who\nhave been harmed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">14.   We are, however, of the view that  for  a  successful  prosecution  of\nsuch  an  action  for  alienation  of  affection,  the   loss   of   marital\nrelationship, companionship, assistance, loss of consortium,  etc.  as  such\nmay not be sufficient, but there must  be  clear  evidence  to  show  active\nparticipation, initiation or encouragement on the  part  of  a  third  party\nthat he/she must have played a substantial part in inducing or  causing  one\nspouse’s loss of other spouse’s affection.  Mere acts,  association,  liking\nas such do not become tortuous.  Few countries and  several  States  in  the\nUnited States of America have passed  legislation  against  bringing  in  an\naction for alienation of affection, due to various  reasons,  including  the\ndifficulties experienced in assessing the monetary damages  and  few  States\nhave also abolished “criminal conversation” action as well.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">15.   We may, however, indicate  that  few  States  and  countries  strongly\nsupport such an action, with the object of maintaining  and  preserving  the\nmarriage as a sacred institution.  Strong support comes from  the  State  of\nMississippi in the United States.  In Knight Vs. Woodfield  50  So.  3d  995\n(Miss. 2011), the husband filed a suit  for  alienation  against  his  wife.\nThe wife alleged paramour after gaining  access  to  a  phone  call.   Facts\ndisclosed they had exchanged 930 text  messages  and  talked  more  than  16\nhours in two months. In that case jurisdictional  issues  were  raised,  but\nCourt reaffirmed that law of alienation of affection is  firmly  established\nin State of Mississippi.  Another  case  of  some  importance  is  Dare  Vs.\nStokes, 62  So,  3d  858  (Miss.  2011),  where  in  a  property  settlement\nagreement of divorced couple, a provision was made that  the  husband  would\nnot bring suit  against  any  other  person  for  alienation  of  affection.\nAgreement was reduced to a final order by the trial  Court.   Later  husband\ncame to know that his wife had a love affair with one Dare and hence  sought\nfor a modification of the agreement.  He also sent a notice to Dare as  well\nof his intention to  file  a  suit  for  alienation  of  affection.   Dare’s\nattempt to intervene and oppose the  application  for  modification  of  the\nagreement was not favourably considered by the Court on the ground  that  he\ncannot middle with the marital relationship.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_19\">16.   Action for alienation of affection lies for  all  improper  intrusions\nor assaults  on  the  marriage  relationship  by  another,  whether  or  not\nassociated with “extramarital  sex”,  his  or  her  continued  overtures  or\nsexual liaisons can be construed as something akin to an assumption of  risk\nthat his/her conduct will injure the marriage and give rise  to  an  action.\nBut all the same, a person is not liable for  alienation  of  affection  for\nmerely becoming a passive object of affection.  The  liability  arises  only\nif there is any active participation, initiation  or  encouragement  on  the\npart of the defendant.  Acts which lead to the loss  of  affection  must  be\nwrongful, intentional, calculated to entice  the  affection  of  one  spouse\naway  from   the   other,  in  order  to  support  a  cause  of  action  for\nalienation  of  affection.   For  proving   a   claim   for   alienation  of\naffection  it  is  not  necessary  for  a  party  to  prove  an   adulterous\nrelationship.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">17.   We have on facts found that A-2 has not intruded into the family  life\nof A-1 and his deceased wife, and the Court on  evidence  acquitted  A-2  of\nall the charges levelled against her.  Consequently, it cannot be said  that\nA-2 had in any way contributed or abetted the  deceased  in  committing  the\nact of suicide, or had attempted to alienate the affection  of  A-1  towards\nhis deceased wife.  If  that  be  so,  we  have  to  examine  what  type  of\nrelationship A-1 had  with  A-2.   Can  it  be  said  as  an  “extra-marital\nrelationship” of such a degree which amounted to  “cruelty”  falling  within\nthe explanation to Section  498A  and  also  leading  to  an  offence  under\n<a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 306</a> IPC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">EXTRA-MARITAL RELATIONSHIP\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_22\">18.   Marital relationship means the legally protected marital  interest  of\none spouse to another which  include  marital  obligation  to  another  like\ncompanionship,  living  under  the  same  roof,  sexual  relation  and   the\nexclusive enjoyment of them, to have children, their  up-bringing,  services\nin the home, support, affection, love,  liking  and  so  on.   Extra-marital\nrelationship as such is not defined in the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_19\">IPC</a>.  Though,  according  to  the\nprosecution in this case, it was that relationship which ultimately  led  to\nmental harassment and cruelty within the explanation to Section 498-\nA and that A-1 had abetted the wife to commit suicide.  We have  to  examine\nwhether the relationship between A-1 and A-2 amounted to  mental  harassment\nand cruelty.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_23\">19.   We have to examine  the  correctness  or  otherwise  of  the  findings\nrecorded by the trial Court, affirmed by the High Court, as to  whether  the\nalleged relationship between A-1 and A-2 has in any way constituted  cruelty\nwithin the meaning of explanation to <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 498A</a> IPC.  The  facts  in  this\ncase have clearly proved that the A-1  has  not  ill-treated  the  deceased,\neither physically or mentally demanding dowry and was living  with  A-1,  in\nthe  matrimonial  home  till  the  date,  she  committed  suicide.   Cruelty\nincludes both physical and mental cruelty for the purpose of  Section  498A.\n<a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 498A</a> IPC reads as under :-\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">      “498A.

The basic purport of the statutory provision is to avoid “cruelty”\n      which stands defined  by  attributing  a  specific  statutory  meaning\n      attached thereto as noticed hereinbefore. Two specific instances  have\n      been taken note of in order to ascribe a meaning to the word “cruelty”\n      as is expressed by the legislatures: whereas Explanation (a)  involves\n      three specific situations viz.  (i)  to  drive  the  woman  to  commit\n      suicide or (ii) to cause grave injury or (iii) danger to life, limb or\n      health, both mental and -\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">      physical, and thus  involving  a  physical  torture  or  atrocity,  in\n      Explanation  (b)  there  is  absence  of  physical  injury   but   the\n      legislature thought it fit to include only coercive  harassment  which\n      obviously as the legislative intent expressed is  equally  heinous  to\n      match the physical injury: whereas one is patent,  the  other  one  is\n      latent but equally serious in terms of the provisions of  the  statute\n      since the same would also embrace the attributes of “cruelty” in terms\n      of Section 498A.”\n\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">21.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"301037\" id=\"span_2\">In <a href=\"/doc/301037/\" id=\"a_23\">Gananath Pattnaik Vs. State of  Orissa</a>,  (2002)  2  SCC  619,  this\nCourt held that the concept of  cruelty  under  <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_24\">Section  498A</a>  IPC  and  its\neffect under <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 306</a> IPC  varies  from  individual  to  individual  also\ndepending upon the social and economic status to which such person  belongs.</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">This Court held that cruelty  for  the  purpose  of  offence  and  the  said\nSection need not be physical.  Even mental torture or abnormal behavior  may\namount to cruelty or harassment in a given case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\">22.   We are of the view that the mere fact that the husband  has  developed\nsome intimacy with another, during the subsistence of  marriage  and  failed\nto  discharge  his  marital  obligations,  as  such  would  not  amount   to\n“cruelty”, but it must be of such a nature as is likely to drive the  spouse\nto commit suicide to fall  within  the  explanation  to  <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_26\">Section  498A</a>  IPC.\nHarassment, of course, need not be in the form of physical assault and  even\nmental harassment also would come within the purview of  <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_27\">Section  498A</a>  IPC.\nMental cruelty, of course, varies from person to person, depending upon  the\nintensity and the degree of endurance, some may meet with courage  and  some\nothers suffer in silence, to some it may be unbearable  and  a  weak  person\nmay think of ending one’s life.  We, on facts, found that the alleged  extra\nmarital relationship was not of such a  nature  as  to  drive  the  wife  to\ncommit suicide or that A-1 had ever intended  or  acted  in  such  a  manner\nwhich under normal circumstances, would drive the wife to commit suicide.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_27\">23.   We also notice in this case that the  wife  committed  suicide  within\nseven years of the  date  of  the  marriage.   Hence,  a  presumption  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 113A</a> of the Evidence Act could be drawn.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_28\">24.     Section  113A  which  was  inserted  by  the  Criminal  Law  (Second\nAmendment) Act, 1983, w.e.f. 26.12.1983, is given below for  easy  reference\n:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">    “113A.  Presumption as to abetment of suicide by a married woman.- When\n    the question is whether the commission of suicide by a woman  had  been\n    abetted by her husband or any relative of her husband and it  is  shown\n    that she had committed suicide within a period of seven years from  the\n    date of her marriage and that her  husband  or  such  relative  of  her\n    husband had subjected her to cruelty, the  court  may  presume,  having\n    regard to all the other circumstances of the case,  that  such  suicide\n    had been abetted by her husband or by such relative of her husband.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">    Explanation.-- For the purposes of this section, &quot;cruelty&quot;  shall  have\n    the same meaning as in <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_29\">section 498A</a> of the Indian  Penal  Code  (45  of\n    1860 ).\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_29\">25.   Section 113A only deals with a presumption which the Court  may  draw\nin a particular fact situation which may arise when  necessary  ingredients\nin order to attract that provision are established.  Criminal law amendment\nand the rule of procedure was   necessitated  so  as  to  meet  the  social\nchallenge of saving the married woman from being ill-treated or forcing  to\ncommit  suicide  by  the  husband  or  his  relatives,   demanding   dowry.\nLegislative mandate of the Section is that when  a  woman  commits  suicide\nwithin seven years of her marriage and it is shown that her husband or  any\nrelative of her husband had subjected her  to  cruelty  as  per  the  terms\ndefined in <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 498A</a> IPC, the Court may presume  having  regard  to  all\nother circumstances of the case that such suicide has been abetted  by  the\nhusband or such person.  Though a presumption could be drawn, the burden of\nproof of showing that such an offence has been  committed  by  the  accused\nunder <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 498A</a> IPC is on the prosecution.  On facts,  we  have  already\nfound that the prosecution has not  discharged  the  burden  that  A-1  had\ninstigated, conspired or intentionally aided so as to  drive  the  wife  to\ncommit suicide or that the alleged extra  marital  affair  was  of  such  a\ndegree which was likely to drive the wife to commit suicide.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_30\">26.   Section 306 refers to abetment  of  suicide.   It  says  that  if  any\nperson commits suicide, whoever abets the commission of such suicide,  shall\nbe punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to  10  years  and\nshall also be liable to fine.  The action for committing suicide is also  on\naccount of mental disturbance caused by mental  and  physical  cruelty.   To\nconstitute an offence under Section 306, the prosecution  has  to  establish\nthat a person has committed suicide and  the  suicide  was  abetted  by  the\naccused.  Prosecution has to establish  beyond  reasonable  doubt  that  the\ndeceased committed  suicide  and  the  accused  abetted  the  commission  of\nsuicide.   But for the alleged extra marital relationship, which if  proved,\ncould  be  illegal  and  immoral,  nothing  has  been  brought  out  by  the\nprosecution to show that the accused had provoked, incited  or  induced  the\nwife to commit suicide.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_31\">27.   We have on facts found that at best the relationship of  A-1  and  A-2\nwas a one-sided love affair, the accused might have developed  some  likings\ntowards A-2, his colleague, all the same, the facts disclose  that  A-1  had\ndischarged his  marital  obligations  towards  the  deceased.  There  is  no\nevidence of physical or mental  torture  demanding  dowry.   Deceased  might\nhave been under serious  “emotional  stress”  in  the  sense  that  she  had\nundergone an abortion in the year 1992, and the year following that,  though\na daughter was born to her, the daughter also died few days  of  its  birth.\nAfter one or two years, she committed suicide.  Evidence,  in  any  way,  is\nlacking in this case to hold, that due to the alleged  relationship  between\nA-1 and A-2, A-1 had  intended  or  intentionally  inflicted  any  emotional\nstress on the deceased wife, so as to drive  her  to  the  extreme  step  of\nending her life.  In the suicide note she had not made  any  accusations  as\nsuch against A-1 or A-2, on the other hand she stated that it  was  she  who\nwas selfish and egoist. Suicide note (Ex.44), which was  translated  by  the\nHigh Court, reads as under :-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">      “My husband Pinakin is a very good man and he is  not  responsible.  I\n      also love him.  However, I am extremely bad, selfish and  egoist  and,\n      therefore, not a match to him.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">      He is in love with Priti Bhakt, serving in LIC and wants to marry  her\n      and, therefore, for their happiness, I am taking this step.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">      No one of  my  house  is  responsible.  Therefore,  they  may  not  be\n      harassed. Kindly arrange their marriage with all pomp and  gaiety.   I\n      gift my dead body to the medical students and I donate my eyes to  the\n      blinds.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">                                                   Yours\n                                                     Jagruti\n\n\n      This is my last wish which be fulfilled for the peace of my soul.”\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_32\">28.   Suicide note completely exonerates A-1, which states that he  was  not\nresponsible for death of the deceased.  On  the  other  hand,  the  deceased\ndescribed herself as extremely selfish, egoist and, therefore, not  a  match\nfor A-1.   She entertained the belief that her husband A-1 was in love  with\nA-2 and wanted to marry A-2.  Note states it was  for  their  happiness  she\nhad decided to end her life.  She also wanted to have the  marriage  of  A-1\nand A-2 solemnized with pomp and gaiety.   On reading the suicide note,  one\ncan infer that the deceased was  so  possessive  of  her  husband,  and  was\nalways under an emotional stress that she might lose her husband.  Too  much\nof possessiveness could also lead to  serious  emotional  stress,  over  and\nabove the fact that she had one abortion and her  daughter  died  after  few\ndays of birth.  No evidence is forthcoming in this case  to  show  that  A-2\never evinced any interest to marry A-1.   On  the  other  hand,  during  the\nsubsistence of the alleged relationship, A-2 herself got married.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_33\">29.   We are, therefore, of the considered view that  the  relationship  A-1\nhad with A-2 was not of such  a  nature  which  under  normal  circumstances\nwould drive one to commit suicide or that A-1 by his  conduct  or  otherwise\never abetted or intended to abet the wife to commit suicide.  Courts  below,\nin our view, have committed serious error in holding that it was due to  the\nextra marital relationship A-1 had with A-2 that led the  deceased  to  take\nthe extreme step to commit suicide, and A-1 was instrumental  for  the  said\nact.   In the circumstances, we are inclined to allow this  appeal  and  set\naside the order of conviction and sentence imposed on the appellant, and  he\nis set at liberty.  Ordered as above.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_34\">                                                             ………..………………….J.\n                                                      (K.S.
