These  Appeals  raise  a  legal\nnodus of substantial public importance  pertaining  to  Court’s  territorial\njurisdiction concerning criminal complaints filed under <a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_1\">Chapter XVII of  the\nNegotiable Instruments Act, 1881</a> (for short, ‘the <a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_2\">NI Act</a>’).  This  is  amply\nadumbrated by the Orders dated 3.11.2009 in I.A.No.1  in  CC  15974/2009  of\nthe three-Judge Bench presided over by the then Hon’ble  the  Chief  Justice\nof India, Hon’ble Mr. Justice V.S. Sirpurkar  and  Hon’ble  Mr.  Justice  P.\nSathasivam which SLP is also concerned with the  interpretation  of  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_3\">Section\n138</a> of the NI Act, and  wherein  the  Bench  after  issuing  notice  on  the\npetition directed that it be posted before the three-Judge Bench.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_3\">                                 <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"529907\" id=\"span_1\">PRECEDENTS\n  The earliest and the most often quoted decision of this Court relevant  to\nthe present conundrum is <a href=\"/doc/529907/\" id=\"a_4\">K. Bhaskaran v. Sankaran Vaidhyan  Balan</a>  (1999)  7\nSCC 510 wherein a two-Judge Bench has, inter alia, interpreted  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_5\">Section  138</a>\nof the NI Act to indicate that,  “the  offence  under  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_6\">Section  138</a>  can  be\ncompleted only with the concatenation of a number of  acts.   Following  are\nthe acts which are components of  the  said  offence:  (1)  Drawing  of  the\ncheque, (2) Presentation of the  cheque  to  the  bank,  (3)  Returning  the\ncheque unpaid by the drawee bank,  (4)  Giving  notice  in  writing  to  the\ndrawer of the cheque demanding payment of the cheque amount, (5) Failure  of\nthe drawer to make payment within 15 days of the  receipt  of  the  notice.”\nThe provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1219882/\" id=\"a_7\">Sections 177</a> to <a href=\"/doc/1693935/\" id=\"a_8\">179</a> of the  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure,\n1973 (for short, ‘<a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_9\">CrPC</a>’) have also been dealt with in detail.   Furthermore,\nBhaskaran in terms draws  a  distinction  between  ‘giving  of  notice’  and\n‘receiving of notice’.  This is for the reason that clause  (b)  of  proviso\nto <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act postulates a demand being made by the payee  or\nthe holder in due course of the dishonoured cheque by  giving  a  notice  in\nwriting to the drawer thereof.  While doing so, the question of the  receipt\nof the notice has also been cogitated upon.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_4\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"463854\" id=\"span_2\">The issuance and the receipt of the  notice  is  significant  because  in  a\nsubsequent judgment of a Coordinate Bench, namely, <a href=\"/doc/463854/\" id=\"a_11\">Harman  Electronics  Pvt.\nLtd. v. National Panasonic India Pvt. Ltd.</a> (2009) 1  SCC  720  emphasis  has\nbeen laid on the receipt of the notice, inter alia, holding that  the  cause\nof action cannot arise by any act of omission or commission on the  part  of\nthe ‘accused’, which on a holistic reading has to be read as  ‘complainant’.\n It appears that Harman transacted business out of  Chandigarh  only,  where\nthe Complainant also maintained an office, although its Head Office  was  in\nDelhi.  Harman issued the cheque to the Complainant  at  Chandigarh;  Harman\nhad its  bank  account  in  Chandigarh  alone.   It  is  unclear  where  the\nComplainant presented the cheque for encashment but it  issued  the  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_12\">Section\n138</a> notice from Delhi.  In those  circumstances,  this  Court  had  observed\nthat the only question for consideration  was  “whether  sending  of  notice\nfrom Delhi  itself  would  give  rise  to  a  cause  of  action  for  taking\ncognizance under the <a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_13\">NI Act</a>.”  It then went on to opine that the proviso  to\nthis Section “imposes certain further conditions which are  required  to  be\nfulfilled before cognizance of the offence can be taken.”   We  respectfully\nagree  with  this  statement  of  law  and  underscore  that   in   criminal\njurisprudence there is  a  discernibly  demarcated  difference  between  the\ncommission of an offence and its  cognizance  leading  to  prosecution.  The\nHarman  approach  is  significant  and  sounds  a  discordant  note  to  the\nBhaskaran ratio.  Harman also highlights the reality  that  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_14\">Section  138</a>  of\nthe NI Act is being rampantly misused so  far  as  territorial  jurisdiction\nfor trial of the Complaint is concerned.  With the passage of time  equities\nhave therefore transferred from one end of the pendulum to  the  other.   It\nis now not uncommon for the Courts to encounter the issuance of a notice  in\ncompliance with clause (b) of the proviso to <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act  from\na situs which bears no connection with the Accused or with any facet of  the\ntransaction between the parties, leave aside the place where  the  dishonour\nof the cheque has taken place.  This is also the  position  as  regards  the\npresentation of the cheque, dishonour  of  which  is  then  pleaded  as  the\nterritorial platform of the Complaint under  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_16\">Section  138</a>  of  the  NI  Act.\nHarman, in fact,  duly  heeds  the  absurd  and  stressful  situation,  fast\nbecoming common-place where several cheques signed by the  same  drawer  are\npresented  for  encashment  and  requisite  notices  of  demand   are   also\ndespatched from different places.  It appears to us that justifiably  so  at\nthat time, the conclusion in Bhaskaran was influenced in  large  measure  by\ncurial compassion towards the unpaid payee/holder, whereas with the  passage\nof two decades  the  manipulative  abuse  of  territorial  jurisdiction  has\nbecome a recurring and piquant factor.  The liberal  approach  preferred  in\nBhaskaran now calls for a stricter interpretation of the statute,  precisely\nbecause of its  misemployment  so  far  as  choice  of  place  of  suing  is\nconcerned.  These are the circumstances which have propelled us to  minutely\nconsider the decisions rendered by two-Judge Benches of this Court.</span>\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"499876\" id=\"span_3\">It is noteworthy that the interpretation to be imparted to  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_17\">Section  138</a>  of\nthe NI Act also arose before a three-Judge Bench in <a href=\"/doc/499876/\" id=\"a_18\">Shri Ishar Alloy  Steels\nLtd. v. Jayaswals Neco  Ltd.</a>  (2001)  3  SCC  609  close  on  the  heels  of\nBhaskaran.  So far as the  factual  matrix  is  concerned,  the  dishonoured\ncheque had been presented for encashment by the  Complainant/holder  in  his\nbank within the statutory period of six months but by the  time  it  reached\nthe drawer’s bank the aforementioned period of limitation had expired.   The\nquestion before the Court was whether the bank  within  the  postulation  of\n<a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 138</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/1485731/\" id=\"a_20\">Sections 3</a> and <a href=\"/doc/829357/\" id=\"a_21\">72</a> of the NI Act was  the  drawee  bank\nor the collecting bank and this Court held that it was the former.   It  was\nobserved that “non-presentation of the cheque to the drawee bank within  the\nperiod specified in the Section would absolve the person issuing the  cheque\nof his criminal liability under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 138</a> of the  NI  Act,  who  otherwise\nmay be liable to pay the cheque amount  to  the  payee  in  a  civil  action\ninitiated under the law.  A combined reading of <a href=\"/doc/1485731/\" id=\"a_23\">Sections 3</a>, <a href=\"/doc/829357/\" id=\"a_24\">72</a>  and  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_25\">138</a>  of\nthe NI Act would leave no doubt in  our  mind  that  the  law  mandates  the\ncheque to be presented at the bank on which it is drawn if the drawer is  to\nbe  held  criminally  liable.”   Clearly,  and  in  our  considered  opinion\nrightly, the Section had been  rendered  &#x27;accused-centric’.   This  decision\nclarifies that the place where a complainant  may  present  the  cheque  for\nencashment would not confer or create territorial jurisdiction, and in  this\nrespect runs counter to the essence of  Bhaskaran  which  paradoxically,  in\nour opinion, makes actions  of  the  Complainant  an  integral  nay  nuclear\nconstituent of the crime itself.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_5\">The principle of precedence should promptly and  precisely  be  paraphrased.\nA co-ordinate Bench is bound to follow the previously published view; it  is\ncertainly competent to add  to  the  precedent  to  make  it  logically  and\ndialectically compelling.  However, once a decision of a  larger  Bench  has\nbeen delivered it is that decision which  mandatorily  has  to  be  applied;\nwhereas a Co-ordinate Bench, in the event that it  finds  itself  unable  to\nagree with an existing ratio, is competent to recommend  the  precedent  for\nreconsideration by referring the case to the Chief Justice for  constitution\nof a larger Bench.  Indubitably, there are a number  of  decisions  by  two-\nJudge Benches on <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act,  the  majority  of  which  apply\nBhaskaran without noting or distinguishing on facts  Ishar  Alloy.   In  our\nopinion, it is imperative for the  Court  to  diligently  distill  and  then\napply the ratio of a decision; and the view of a larger Bench ought  not  to\nbe disregarded.   Inasmuch as the  three-Judge  Bench  in  Ishar  Alloy  has\ncategorically stated that  for  criminal  liability  to  be  attracted,  the\nsubject cheque has to be presented to the bank on which it is  drawn  within\nthe prescribed period, Bhaskaran has been  significantly  whittled  down  if\nnot overruled.  Bhaskaran  has  also  been  drastically  diluted  by  Harman\ninasmuch as it has given primacy to the service of a notice on  the  Accused\ninstead of its mere issuance by the Complainant.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_6\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1654180\" id=\"span_4\">In <a href=\"/doc/1654180/\" id=\"a_27\">Prem Chand Vijay Kumar v. Yashpal Singh</a> (2005) 4 SCC  417,  another  two-\nJudge Bench held that upon a notice under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 138</a> of the  NI  Act  being\nissued, a subsequent presentation of a cheque and its  dishonour  would  not\ncreate another ‘cause of action’ which could set the <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_29\">Section  138</a>  machinery\nin motion.  In that view, if the period of limitation had run out,  a  fresh\nnotice of demand was bereft of any legal efficacy.</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"781024\" id=\"span_5\"><a href=\"/doc/781024/\" id=\"a_30\">SIL Import, USA v.  Exim\nAides  Silk  Exporters</a>  (1999)  4  SCC  567  was  applied   in   which   the\ndetermination was that since the requisite notice  had  been  despatched  by\nFAX on 26.6.1996  the  limitation  for  filing  the  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_31\">Section  138</a>  Complaint\nexpired on 26.7.1996.  What is interesting is  the  observation  that  “four\nconstituents of <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 138</a>  are  required  to  be  proved  to  successfully\nprosecute the drawer of  an  offence  under  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_33\">Section  138</a>  of  the  NI  Act”\n(emphasis supplied).  It  is  also  noteworthy  that  instead  of  the  five\nBhaskaran concomitants, only four have been  spelt  out  in  the  subsequent\njudgment in Prem Chand.  The commission of a crime  was  distinguished  from\nits  prosecution  which,  in  our  considered  opinion,   is   the   correct\ninterpretation of the law.  In other words, the four  or  five  concomitants\nof the Section have to be in existence for the initiation  as  well  as  the\nsuccessful prosecution of the offence,  which  offence  however  comes  into\nexistence as soon as subject cheque  is  dishonoured  by  the  drawee  bank.</span>\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"401594\" id=\"span_6\">Another two-Judge Bench in <a href=\"/doc/401594/\" id=\"a_34\">Shamshad Begum v. B. Mohammed</a> (2008)  13  SCC  77\nspeaking through Pasayat J this time around applied Bhaskaran and  concluded\nthat since the <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 138</a> notice was issued from and replied to  Mangalore,\nCourts in that city possessed territorial jurisdiction.   As  already  noted\nabove, this view is not reconcilable with the later decision of Harman.</span>\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1293509\" id=\"span_7\">The two-Judge Bench decision in <a href=\"/doc/1293509/\" id=\"a_36\">Mosaraf Hossain Khan v.  Bhagheeratha  Engg.\nLtd.</a> (2006) 3 SCC 658 requires to be discussed in some detail.  A  Complaint\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act was filed and cognizance was  taken  by  the\nChief Judicial Magistrate, Birbhum at Suri, West Bengal  for  the  dishonour\nof a  number  of  cheques  issued  by  the  accused-company  which  had  its\nheadquarters in Ernakulam, Kerala where significantly the  accused-company’s\nbank on whom the dishonoured cheques had been drawn  was  located.   Several\njudgments were referred to, but not  Bhaskaran.   The  third  ingredient  in\nBhaskaran, i.e. the returning of the cheque unpaid by the drawee  bank,  was\nnot reflected upon.  Inasmuch as Mosaraf Hossain  refers  copiously  to  the\ncause of action having arisen in West Bengal without  adverting  at  all  to\nBhaskaran, leave aside the three-Judge Bench decision in Ishar  Alloy,   the\ndecision may be seen as per incuriam.  Moreover, the concept  of  forum  non\nconveniens has no role to  play  under  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_38\">Section  138</a>  of  the  NI  Act,  and\nfurthermore that it can certainly be contended by the  accused-company  that\nit was justifiable/convenient for it to initiate  litigation  in  Ernakulam.\nIf Bhaskaran was followed,  Courts  in  Ernakulam  unquestionably  possessed\nterritorial jurisdiction.   It is,  however,  important  to  italicize  that\nthere was an unequivocal endorsement of the Bench of a previously  expressed\nview that, “where the territorial jurisdiction is concerned the main  factor\nto be considered is the place where the alleged offence was committed”.</span>   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"152281550\" id=\"span_8\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"125009484\" id=\"span_9\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1397958\" id=\"span_10\">In\nsimilar vein, this Court has opined in <a href=\"/doc/1397958/\" id=\"a_39\">Om Hemrajani v. State of U.P.</a>  (2005)\n1  SCC  617,  in  the  context  of  <a href=\"/doc/1219882/\" id=\"a_40\">Sections  177</a>  to  <a href=\"/doc/1226164/\" id=\"a_41\">180</a>  CrPC  that  “for\njurisdiction emphasis is on the place where the offence is committed.”\nThe territorial jurisdiction conundrum which, candidly is currently  in  the\ncauldron owing to varying if not  conflicting  ratios,  has  been  cogitated\nupon very recently by a two-Judge Bench in Criminal Appeal  No.808  of  2013\ntitled <a href=\"/doc/125009484/\" id=\"a_42\">Nishant Aggarwal v. Kailash Kumar  Sharma</a>  decided  on  1.7.2013  and\nagain by the same Bench in Criminal Appeal No.1457 of  2013  titled  <a href=\"/doc/152281550/\" id=\"a_43\">Escorts\nLimited v. Rama Mukherjee</a> decided on  17.09.2013.   Bhaskaran  was  followed\nand Ishar Alloy and Harman were explained.  In Nishant the Appellant  issued\na post-dated cheque drawn on Standard Chartered Bank, Guwahati in favour  of\ncomplainant-respondent.  It appears that the Appellant  had  endeavoured  to\ncreate a case or rather a defence by reporting to his bank  in  Guwahati  as\nwell as to the local police station that ‘one cheque (corresponding  to  the\ncheque in question) was missing and hence payment should be  stopped.’   The\nRespondent-drawer was a resident of District Bhiwani, Haryana; he  presented\nthe cheque for encashment at  Canara  Bank,  Bhiwani  but  it  was  returned\nunpaid.  The holder then issued a legal notice which failed  to  elicit  the\ndemanded sum of money corresponding  to  the  cheque  value,  and  thereupon\nfollowed it by the filing of a criminal complaint  under  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_44\">Sections  138</a>  and\n<a href=\"/doc/686130/\" id=\"a_45\">141</a> of the NI Act at Bhiwani.  The Judicial Magistrate, Bhiwani, vide  order\ndated 5.3.2011,  concluded  that  the  court  in  Bhiwani  did  not  possess\nterritorial jurisdiction and  he  accordingly  returned  the  complaint  for\npresentation before the proper Court. The five concomitants of  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_46\">Section  138</a>\nextracted in Bhaskaran, were reiterated and various paragraphs from it  were\nreproduced by this Court.  Nishant also did not follow  Ishar  Alloy  which,\nas already analysed, has concluded that the  second  Bhaskaran  concomitant,\nnamely, presentation of cheque to the bank refers to  the  drawee  bank  and\nnot the holder’s bank, is not primarily relevant for  the  determination  of\nterritorial  jurisdiction.   Nishant  distinguished  Ishar  Alloy   on   the\npredication that the question  of  territorial  jurisdiction  had  not  been\nraised <a href=\"/doc/152281550/\" id=\"a_47\">in that case</a>.  It is axiomatic  that  when  a  Court  interprets  any\nstatutory provision, its opinion must apply to and  be  determinate  in  all\nfactual and legal permutations and situations.  We think that the dictum  in\nIshar Alloy is very relevant and conclusive to the discussion in  hand.   It\nalso justifies emphasis that Ishar Alloy is the only case  before  us  which\nwas decided by a three-Judge  Bench  and,  therefore,  was  binding  on  all\nsmaller Benches.  We ingeminate that it is  the  drawee  Bank  and  not  the\nComplainant’s Bank which is postulated in the so-called  second  constituent\nof <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_48\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act,  and  it  is  this  postulate  that  spurs  us\ntowards the conclusion that we have  arrived  at  in  the  present  Appeals.\nThere is also a discussion of Harman to reiterate  that  the  offence  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_49\">Section 138</a> is complete only when the five factors are present.  It  is  our\nconsidered view, which we shall  expound  upon,  that  the  offence  in  the\ncontemplation of <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_50\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act is the dishonour  of  the  cheque\nalone, and it is the concatenation of the five concomitants of that  Section\nthat enable the prosecution of  the  offence  in  contradistinction  to  the\ncompletion/commission of the offence.</span></span></span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_7\">We have also painstakingly perused Escorts Limited which  was  also  decided\nby  the  Nishant  two-Judge  Bench.   Previous  decisions  were  considered,\neventually leading to the conclusion that since  the  concerned  cheque  had\nbeen presented for encashment at  New  Delhi,  its  Metropolitan  Magistrate\npossessed territorial jurisdiction  to  entertain  and  decide  the  subject\nComplaint under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act.   Importantly,  in  a  subsequent\norder, in FIL Industries Ltd. v. Imtiyaz Ahmed Bhat passed  on  12th  August\n2013, it was decided that the place from  where  the  statutory  notice  had\nemanated would not of its own have the consequence of  vesting  jurisdiction\nupon that place.   Accordingly,  it  bears  repetition  that  the  ratio  in\nBhaskaran has been drastically diluted in that the situs of the notice,  one\nof the so-called five ingredients of <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 138</a>, has now been held  not  to\nclothe  that  Court  with  territorial  competency.   The   conflicting   or\nincongruent opinions need to be resolved.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_8\">                      JUDICIAL APPROACH ON JURISDICTION\nWe shall take a short  digression  in  terms  of  brief  discussion  of  the\napproach preferred by this Court in the context of <a href=\"/doc/86911060/\" id=\"a_53\">Section 20</a>  of  the  Code\nof Civil Procedure, 1908 (hereinafter referred to as,  ‘<a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_54\">CPC</a>’),  which  inter\nalia, enjoins that a suit must be instituted in a  court  within  the  local\nlimits  of  whose  jurisdiction  the  Defendant  actually  and   voluntarily\nresides, or carries on business, or personally works for gain, or where  the\ncause of action wholly or in part arises.  The Explanation to  that  Section\nis important; it prescribes that a corporation shall be deemed to  carry  on\nbusiness at its sole or principal office, or, in respect  of  any  cause  of\naction arising at any place where it has also a subordinate office, at  such\nplace.  Since this provision primarily keeps the Defendant  in  perspective,\nthe corporation spoken of  in  the  Explanation,  obviously  refers  to  the\nDefendant.  A plain reading of <a href=\"/doc/86911060/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 20</a> of the  CPC  arguably  allows  the\nPlaintiff a multitude of choices in regard to where  it  may  institute  its\nlis, suit or action.  Corporations and  partnership  firms,  and  even  sole\nproprietorship concerns, could well be transacting  business  simultaneously\nin several cities.  If sub-sections (a) and (b) of  <a href=\"/doc/232831/\" id=\"a_56\">Section  20</a>  are  to  be\ninterpreted disjunctively from sub-section (c), as the use of the word  ‘or’\nappears to permit the Plaintiff to file the suit at any of the places  where\nthe cause of action may have arisen regardless of whether the Defendant  has\neven a subordinate office  at  that  place.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1695101\" id=\"span_11\">However,  if  the  Defendants’\nlocation is to form the fulcrum of jurisdiction, and it has an  office  also\nat the place where the cause of action has occurred, it has been  held  that\nthe  Plaintiff  is  precluded  from  instituting  the  suit  anywhere  else.\nObviously, this is also because every other place would constitute  a  forum\nnon  conveniens.   This  Court  has  harmonised  the  various  hues  of  the\nconundrum of the place of suing in several cases and has gone to the  extent\nof laying down that it should be courts endeavour to locate the place  where\nthe cause of action has substantially arisen and reject others where it  may\nhave incidentally arisen.  <a href=\"/doc/1695101/\" id=\"a_57\">Patel Roadways Limited, Bombay v.

State of  Maharashtra</a>  (2000)  7  SCC  640  this  Court  had  to\nconsider the powers of High Courts under <a href=\"/doc/618973/\" id=\"a_61\">Article 226(2)</a> of the  Constitution\nof India.  Noting the presence of the phrase “cause of  action”  therein  it\nwas clarified that since some events central to  the  investigation  of  the\nalleged crime asseverated in the Complaint had taken  place  in  Mumbai  and\nespecially  because  the  fundamental  grievance  was  the  falsity  of  the\nComplaint filed in Shillong, the writ jurisdiction of the Bombay High  Court\nwas unquestionably available.  The infusion of  the  concept  of  ‘cause  of\naction’ into the criminal  dispensation  has  led  to  subsequent  confusion\ncountenanced in High Courts.  It seems to us that Bhaskaran allows  multiple\nvenues to the Complainant which runs counter to this Court’s preference  for\nsimplifying the law.  Courts are enjoined to interpret  the  law  so  as  to\neradicate ambiguity or nebulousness, and to ensure  that  legal  proceedings\nare not used as a device for harassment, even of  an  apparent  transgressor\nof the law.  Law’s endeavour is to bring the culprit to book and to  provide\nsuccour for the aggrieved  party  but  not  to  harass  the  former  through\nvexatious proceedings.  Therefore, precision and  exactitude  are  necessary\nespecially where the location of a litigation is concerned.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">                             RELEVANT PROVISIONS\nThe provisions which will have to be examined and  analysed  are  reproduced\nfor facility of reference :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">                     1 <a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_62\">Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881</a>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">2</span>\n\n“138.

The  avowed  intendment\nof the amendment was to enhance the acceptability of cheques.  It was  based\non the Report of the Committee on Banking Laws by Dr. Rajamannar,  submitted\nin 1975, which suggested, inter alia,  penalizing  the  issuance  of  cheque\nwithout  sufficient  funds.   The   Minister   of   Finance   had   assuaged\napprehensions by  arguing  that  safeguards  for  honest  persons  had  been\nincorporated in the provisions, viz.,   (i)  the  cheque  should  have  been\nissued in discharge of  liability;  (ii)  the  cheque  should  be  presented\nwithin its validity period; (iii) a Notice had  to  be  sent  by  the  Payee\ndemanding payment within 15 days of receiving notice of dishonour; (iv)  the\ndrawer was allowed to make payment within 15 days from the date  of  receipt\nof notice; (v) Complaint was to be made within one month  of  the  cause  of\naction arising; (vi) no Court inferior to that of MM or JMFC was to try  the\noffence.   The  Finance  Minister  had  also  stated  that  the  Court   had\ndiscretion  whether  the  Drawer   would   be   imprisoned   or/and   fined.\nDetractors, however, pointed out that the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_71\">IPC</a>  already  envisioned  criminal\nliability for cheque-bouncing where dishonest  or  fraudulent  intention  or\nmens rea on part  of  the  Drawer  was  evident,  namely,  cheating,  fraud,\ncriminal breach of trust etc.  Therefore,  there  was  no  justification  to\nmake the dishonour of cheques a  criminal  offence,  ignoring  factors  like\nilliteracy,  indispensable  necessities,   honest/innocent   mistake,   bank\nfrauds, bona fide  belief,  and/or  unexpected  attachment  or  freezing  of\naccount in any judicial proceedings as it would bring  even  honest  persons\nwithin the ambit of <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_72\">Section 138</a> NI Act.   The  possibility  of  abusing  the\nprovision as a tool of harassment could also  not  be  ruled  out.   Critics\nalso decried the punishment for being harsh; that civil liability can  never\nbe converted into criminal liability; that singling out cheques out  of  all\nother  negotiable  instruments  would  be  violative  of   <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_73\">Article   14</a>   of\nConstitution of India.    Critics  contended  that  there  was  insufficient\nempirical enquiry into statutes  or  legislation  in  foreign  jurisdictions\ncriminalizing the dishonour of cheques and  statistics  had  not  been  made\navailable bearing out that criminalization would increase the  acceptability\nof cheque.  The Minister of Finance was  not  entirely  forthright  when  he\nstated  in  Parliament  that  the  drawer  was   also   allowed   sufficient\nopportunity to say whether the dishonour was by mistake.  It must  be  borne\nin mind that in the U.K. deception and dishonesty  are  key  elements  which\nrequire to be proved.   In  the  USA,  some  States  have  their  own  laws,\nrequiring fraudulent intent or knowledge of insufficient funds  to  be  made\ngood. France has criminalized and subsequently decriminalized the  dishonour\nexcept in limited circumstances.  Instead, it provides for  disqualification\nfrom issuing cheques, a practice which had been adopted in Italy  and  Spain\nalso.  We have undertaken this succinct  study  mindful  of  the  fact  that\nParliamentary debates have a limited  part  to  play  in  interpretation  of\nstatutes, the  presumption  being  that  Legislators  have  the  experience,\nexpertise and language skills  to  draft  laws  which  unambiguously  convey\ntheir intentions and expectations for  the  enactments.   What  is  palpably\nclear  is  that  Parliament  was  aware  that  they  were  converting  civil\nliability into criminal  content  inter  alia  by  the  deeming  fiction  of\nculpability  in  terms  of  the  pandect  comprising  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_74\">Section  138</a>  and  the\nsucceeding  Sections,  which  severely  curtail  defences  to   prosecution.\nParliament was also  aware  that  the  offence  of  cheating  etc.,  already\nenvisaged in the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_75\">IPC</a>, continued to be available.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_22\">                 CIVIL LAW CONCEPTS NOT STRICTLY APPLICABLE\nWe have already cautioned against the extrapolation of  civil  law  concepts\nsuch as “cause of action” onto  criminal  law.   <a href=\"/doc/1219882/\" id=\"a_76\">Section  177</a>  of  the  CrPC\nunambiguously states that every offence shall ordinarily  be  inquired  into\nand tried by a Court within  whose  local  jurisdiction  it  was  committed.\n“Offence”, by virtue of the definition ascribed to the word by <a href=\"/doc/1879701/\" id=\"a_77\">Section  2(n)</a>\nof the CrPC means any act or omission made punishable by any law.   Halsbury\nstates that the venue for the trial of a crime is confined to the  place  of\nits occurrence.  Blackstone opines that  crime  is  local  and  jurisdiction\nover it vests in the Court and Country where the crime is  committed.   This\nis obviously the raison d’etre for the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_78\">CrPC</a> making a departure from <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_79\">the  CPC</a>\nin  not  making  the  “cause  of  action”   routinely   relevant   for   the\ndetermination of territoriality of criminal courts.  The word  “action”  has\ntraditionally been understood to be synonymous to  “suit”,  or  as  ordinary\nproceedings in a Court of justice  for  enforcement  or  protection  of  the\nrights of the initiator of the  proceedings.   “Action,  generally  means  a\nlitigation in a civil Court for the recovery of individual right or  redress\nof individual wrong, inclusive, in its proper legal sense, of suits  by  the\nCrown” - [Bradlaugh v. Clarke 8  Appeal  Cases  354  p.361].   Unlike  civil\nactions, where the Plaintiff has the burden of filing and proving its  case,\nthe responsibility  of  investigating  a  crime,  marshalling  evidence  and\nwitnesses, rests with the State.  Therefore, while the  convenience  of  the\nDefendant in a civil action may be  relevant,  the  convenience  of  the  so\ncalled complainant/victim  has  little  or  no  role  to  play  in  criminal\nprosecution.  Keeping in perspective the presence of the  word  “ordinarily”\nin <a href=\"/doc/1219882/\" id=\"a_80\">Section 177</a> of CrPC, we hasten to adumbrate that  the  exceptions  to  it\nare contained  in  the  <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_81\">CrPC</a>  itself,  that  is,  in  the  contents  of  the\nsucceeding  Section  178.   The  <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_82\">CrPC</a>  also  contains  an   explication   of\n“complaint” as any allegation to a Magistrate with  a  view  to  his  taking\naction in respect of the commission of  an  offence;  not  being   a  police\nreport.  Prosecution ensues from  a  Complaint  or  police  report  for  the\npurpose  of  determining  the  culpability  of  a  person  accused  of   the\ncommission of a crime; and unlike a civil action or suit is carried out  (or\n‘prosecuted’)  by  the  State  or  its  nominated  agency.   The   principal\ndefinition of “prosecution” imparted by Black’s Law Dictionary  5th  Edition\nis “a criminal action; the proceeding  instituted  and  carried  on  by  due\nprocess of law, before a competent Tribunal, for the purpose of  determining\nthe guilt or innocence of a person charged with crime.”   These  reflections\nare necessary because <a href=\"/doc/595945/\" id=\"a_83\">Section 142(b)</a> of the NI Act contains the words,  “the\ncause of  action  arises  under  the  proviso  to  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_84\">Section  138</a>”,  resulting\narguably, but in  our  opinion  irrelevantly,  to  the  blind  borrowing  of\nessentially civil law attributes onto criminal  proceedings.   We  reiterate\nthat Section 178 admits of no  debate  that  in  criminal  prosecution,  the\nconcept of “cause of action”, being the  bundle  of  facts  required  to  be\nproved in a suit and accordingly  also  being  relevant  for  the  place  of\nsuing, is not pertinent or germane for determining territorial  jurisdiction\nof criminal Trials.  <a href=\"/doc/1220064/\" id=\"a_85\">Section 178</a>, CrPC explicitly states that every  offence\nshall ordinarily be inquired into and tried by a Court  within  whose  local\njurisdiction it was committed.  Section 179 is of  similar  tenor.   We  are\nalso unable to locate any  provision  of  the  <a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_86\">NI  Act</a>  which  indicates  or\nenumerates the extraordinary circumstances which would justify  a  departure\nfrom the stipulation that the place where the offence is committed is  where\nthe prosecution has to be conducted.   In  fact,  since  cognizance  of  the\noffence is subject to the five  Bhaskaran  components  or  concomitants  the\nconcatenation of which ripens the already committed  offence  under  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_87\">Section\n138</a> NI Act into a prosecutable offence, the employment of the phrase  “cause\nof action” in <a href=\"/doc/595945/\" id=\"a_88\">Section 142</a> of the NI Act is apposite for  taking  cognizance,\nbut inappropriate and irrelevant for determining commission of  the  subject\noffence.  There are myriad  examples  of  the  commission  of  a  crime  the\nprosecution of which  is  dependent  on  extraneous  contingencies  such  as\nobtainment of sanction for prosecution under <a href=\"/doc/97670/\" id=\"a_89\">Section 19</a>  of  the  Prevention\nof Corruption  Act  1988.   Similar  situation  is  statutorily  created  by\n<a href=\"/doc/188229543/\" id=\"a_90\">Section 19</a> of the Environmental Protection  Act  1986,  <a href=\"/doc/360038/\" id=\"a_91\">Section  11</a>  of  the\nCentral Sales Tax Act 1956, <a href=\"/doc/840737/\" id=\"a_92\">Section 279</a> of the Income Tax Act, <a href=\"/doc/295559/\" id=\"a_93\">Sections  132</a>\nand <a href=\"/doc/1417508/\" id=\"a_94\">308</a>, CrPC, <a href=\"/doc/983013/\" id=\"a_95\">Section 137</a> of the Customs Act etc.   It  would  be  idle  to\ncontend that  the  offence  comes  into  existence  only  on  the  grant  of\npermission for prosecution, or that this permission constitutes an  integral\npart of the offence itself.  It would also  be  futile  to  argue  that  the\nplace where the permission is  granted  would  provide  the  venue  for  the\ntrial.  If sanction is not granted the offence does  not  vanish.   Equally,\nif sanction  is  granted  from  a  place  other  than  where  the  crime  is\ncommitted,  it  is  the  latter  which  will  remain  the  place   for   its\nprosecution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_23\">                             <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1546702\" id=\"span_15\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"231567\" id=\"span_16\">SECTION 138 NI ACT\nThe marginal note of <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_96\">Section 138</a>  of  the  NI  Act  explicitly  defines  the\noffence as being the dishonour of cheques for insufficiency, etc., of  funds\nin the account.  Of course, the headings, captions or  opening  words  of  a\npiece  of  legislation  are  normally  not   strictly   or   comprehensively\ndeterminative of the sweep  of  the  actual  Section  itself,  but  it  does\npresage its intendment.  See: <a href=\"/doc/231567/\" id=\"a_97\">Frick India Ltd. v. Union of  India</a>  (<a href=\"/doc/1546702/\" id=\"a_98\">1990)  1\nSCC 400 and Forage &amp; Co. v. Municipal Corporation of Greater  Bombay</a>  (1999)\n8 SCC 577.  Accordingly, unless the provisions of the Section clearly  point\nto the contrary, the offence is concerned with the dishonour  of  a  cheque;\nand in the conundrum before us the body of  this  provision  speaks  in  the\nsame timbre since it  refers  to  a  cheque  being  “returned  by  the  bank\nunpaid”.  None of the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_99\">IPC</a> have been rendered  nugatory  by\n<a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_100\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act and both operate on their own.  It is  trite  that\nmens rea is the quintessential of every crime. The objective  of  Parliament\nwas to strengthen  the  use  of  cheques,  distinct  from  other  negotiable\ninstruments, as mercantile tender and therefore it became essential for  the\n<a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_101\">Section 138</a> NI Act offence to be freed from the requirement of proving  mens\nrea.  This has been achieved by deeming the  commission  of  an  offence  de\nhors mens rea not  only  under  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_102\">Section  138</a>  but  also  by  virtue  of  the\nsucceeding two Sections.  <a href=\"/doc/268919/\" id=\"a_103\">Section 139</a> carves out the  presumption  that  the\nholder of a cheque has received it  for  the  discharge  of  any  liability.\n<a href=\"/doc/1685033/\" id=\"a_104\">Section 140</a> clarifies that it will not be available  as  a  defence  to  the\ndrawer that he had no reason to believe, when he issued the cheque, that  it\nwould be dishonoured.  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_105\">Section 138</a> unequivocally states that the offence  is\ncommitted no sooner the drawee bank returns the cheque unpaid.\n<a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_106\">Section 138</a> NI Act is  structured  in  two  parts  –  the  primary  and  the\nprovisory.  It must be kept in mind that the  Legislature  does  not  ordain\nwith one hand and immediately negate it with the other.  The  proviso  often\ncarves out a minor detraction or diminution of the main provision  of  which\nit is an appendix or addendum or auxiliary.  Black Law Dictionary states  in\nthe context of a proviso that it is – “a limitation or exception to a  grant\nmade or authority conferred, the effect of which is to declare that the  one\nshall not operate, or the other be exercised, unless in the  case  provided.\n…. A clause or part of a clause in a statute, the office of which is  either\nto except something from the enacting clause, or to qualify or restrain  its\ngenerality, or to exclude some possible ground of misinterpretation  of  its\nextent.”  It should also  be  kept  in  perspective  that  a  proviso  or  a\ncondition are synonymous.   In our  perception  in  the  case  in  hand  the\ncontents of the proviso place  conditions  on  the  operation  of  the  main\nprovision, while it does  form  a  constituent  of   the  crime  itself,  it\nmodulates  or  regulates  the  crime  in  circumstances  where,  unless  its\nprovisions  are  complied  with,  the  already   committed   crime   remains\nimpervious to prosecution.  The  proviso  to  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_107\">Section  138</a>  of  the  NI  Act\nfeatures three factors which are additionally required  for  prosecution  to\nbe successful.  In this  aspect  <a href=\"/doc/595945/\" id=\"a_108\">Section  142</a>  correctly  employs  the  term\n“cause of action” as compliance with the  three  factors  contained  in  the\nproviso are essential for the cognizance of the offence,  even  though  they\nare not part of the action constituting  the  crime.    To  this  extent  we\nrespectfully concur with Bhaskaran in that the concatenation  of  all  these\nconcomitants,  constituents  or  ingredients  of  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_109\">Section  138</a>  NI  Act,  is\nessential for the successful initiation or launch of the  prosecution.   We,\nhowever, are of the view that so far as the offence itself the  proviso  has\nno  role  to  play.   Accordingly  a  reading  of  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_110\">Section  138</a>  NI  Act  in\nconjunction with <a href=\"/doc/1219882/\" id=\"a_111\">Section 177</a>, CrPC  leaves  no  manner  of  doubt  that  the\nreturn of the cheque by the drawee bank alone constitutes the commission  of\nthe offence and indicates the place where the offence is committed.\nIn this analysis we hold that the place, situs or venue of judicial  inquiry\nand trial of the offence must logically be restricted to  where  the  drawee\nbank, is located.  The law should not be warped for  commercial  exigencies.\nAs it is <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_112\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act  has  introduced  a  deeming  fiction  of\nculpability, even though, Section 420 is still available in case  the  payee\nfinds it advantageous or convenient to proceed  under  that  provision.   An\ninterpretation should not be imparted to <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_113\">Section 138</a> which  will  render  it\nas a device of harassment i.e. by sending notices from a place which has  no\ncasual connection with the transaction  itself,  and/or  by  presenting  the\ncheque(s) at any of the banks where the payee may have an account.   In  our\ndiscernment, it is also now  manifest  that  traders  and  businessmen  have\nbecome  reckless  and  incautious  in  extending  credit  where  they  would\nheretofore have been extremely hesitant, solely because of the  availability\nof redress by way of  criminal  proceedings.   It  is  always  open  to  the\ncreditor to insist that the cheques in question be made payable at  a  place\nof  the  creditor’s  convenience.   Today’s  reality  is  that   the   every\nMagistracy is inundated with prosecutions under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_114\">Section 138</a> NI Act, so  much\nso that the burden is becoming unbearable and detrimental  to  the  disposal\nof other  equally  pressing  litigation.   We  think  that  Courts  are  not\nrequired to twist  the  law  to  give  relief  to  incautious  or  impetuous\npersons; beyond <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_115\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act.</span></span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_24\">We feel compelled to reiterate our empathy with a payee who has  been  duped\nor deluded by a swindler  into  accepting  a  cheque  as  consideration  for\ndelivery of any of his property; or because of the receipt of a  cheque  has\ninduced the payee to omit to do anything resulting in  some  damage  to  the\npayee.  The relief introduced by <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_116\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act  is  in  addition\nto the contemplations in the  <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_117\">IPC</a>.   It  is  still  open  to  such  a  payee\nrecipient of a dishonoured cheque to lodge a First Information  Report  with\nthe Police or file a Complaint directly  before  the  concerned  Magistrate.\nIf the payee succeeds in establishing that the inducement  for  accepting  a\ncheque  which  subsequently  bounced  had  occurred  where  he  resides   or\nordinarily transacts business, he will not have to suffer  the  travails  of\njourneying to  the  place  where  the  cheque  has  been  dishonoured.   All\nremedies under the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_118\">IPC</a> and <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_119\">CrPC</a> are available to such a payee if he  chooses\nto pursue this course of action, rather than a Complaint under  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_120\">Section  138</a>\nof the NI Act.  And of course, he  can  always  file  a  suit  for  recovery\nwherever the cause of action arises dependent on his choosing.\nThe interpretation of <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_121\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act which commends itself to  us\nis that the offence contemplated therein stands committed on  the  dishonour\nof the cheque, and accordingly the JMFC at the place where  this  occurs  is\nordinarily where the Complaint must be filed, entertained  and  tried.   The\ncognizance of the crime by the JMFC at that  place  however,  can  be  taken\nonly when the concomitants  or  constituents  contemplated  by  the  Section\nconcatenate with each other.  We clarify that the place of the  issuance  or\ndelivery of the  statutory  notice  or  where  the  Complainant  chooses  to\npresent the cheque for encashment by his bank are not relevant for  purposes\nof territorial jurisdiction of the  Complaints  even  though  non-compliance\nthereof will inexorably lead to the dismissal of the complaint.   It  cannot\nbe contested that considerable confusion prevails on the  interpretation  of\n<a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_122\">Section 138</a> in particular and Chapter XVII in general of the  <a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_123\">NI  Act</a>.   The\nvindication of this view is duly manifested by the decisions and  conclusion\narrived at by the High Courts even in the few cases that we shall decide  by\nthis Judgment.  We clarify that the  Complainant  is  statutorily  bound  to\ncomply with Section 177 etc. of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_124\">CrPC</a> and therefore the  place  or  situs\nwhere the <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_125\">Section 138</a> Complaint is to be filed is not of his choosing.   The\nterritorial jurisdiction is restricted  to  the  Court  within  whose  local\njurisdiction the offence was committed, which  in  the  present  context  is\nwhere the cheque is dishonoured by the bank on which it is drawn.\nWe are quite alive to the magnitude of the impact that the present  decision\nshall have to possibly lakhs of cases pending  in  various  Courts  spanning\nacross the country.   One approach could be to declare  that  this  judgment\nwill have only prospective  pertinence,  i.e.  applicability  to  Complaints\nthat  may  be  filed  after  this  pronouncement.    However,   keeping   in\nperspective the  hardship  that  this  will  continue  to  bear  on  alleged\naccused/respondents who may have to  travel  long  distances  in  conducting\ntheir defence, and also mindful of the  legal  implications  of  proceedings\nbeing permitted  to  continue  in  a  Court  devoid  of  jurisdiction,  this\nrecourse  in  entirety  does  not  commend  itself  to  us.   Consequent  on\nconsiderable  consideration we think it expedient to direct that only  those\ncases where, post the summoning and appearance of the alleged  Accused,  the\nrecording of evidence has commenced as envisaged in <a href=\"/doc/109927775/\" id=\"a_126\">Section  145(2)</a>  of  the\nNegotiable Instruments Act, 1881, will proceeding continue  at  that  place.\nTo  clarify,  regardless  of  whether  evidence  has  been  led  before  the\nMagistrate at the pre-summoning  stage,  either  by  affidavit  or  by  oral\nstatement, the Complaint will be maintainable only at the  place  where  the\ncheque  stands  dishonoured.    To   obviate   and   eradicate   any   legal\ncomplications, the category of Complaint cases where proceedings  have  gone\nto the stage of <a href=\"/doc/109927775/\" id=\"a_127\">Section 145(2)</a> or  beyond  shall  be  deemed  to  have  been\ntransferred  by  us  from  the  Court  ordinarily   possessing   territorial\njurisdiction, as now clarified, to the Court where it is presently  pending.\n    All   other   Complaints   (obviously   including   those   where    the\naccused/respondent has not been properly served) shall be  returned  to  the\nComplainant  for  filing  in  the  proper  Court,  in  consonance  with  our\nexposition of the law.  If such Complaints are filed/refiled  within  thirty\ndays of their return, they shall be deemed to have  been  filed  within  the\ntime prescribed by law, unless the initial or prior filing was  itself  time\nbarred.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">                         DISPOSAL OF PRESENT APPEALS\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">Crl.

A learned Single Judge of the High  Court  of  Judicature  at  Bombay,\nNagpur  Bench  has,  pursuant  to  a  threadbare  discussion  of   Bhaskaran\nconcluded that since the concerned cheque was drawn on the  Bank  of  India,\nBhandara  Branch,  Maharashtra  where  it  was  dishonoured,  the   Judicial\nMagistrate First Class, Digras, District Yavatmal  had  no  jurisdiction  to\nentertain the Complaint.  It is pertinent to note that  the  subject  cheque\nwas presented at Digras, District Yavatmal where the Complainant had a  bank\naccount although he was a resident of  District  Washim,  Maharashtra.   The\nlearned Single Judge, in the impugned judgment,  had  rightly  rejected  the\nargument that the Complaint itself should be dismissed; instead  he  ordered\nthat it be returned to the complainant for filing in the appropriate  Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_27\">The Appeal is accordingly dismissed.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">Crl.

In this Appeal the  Respondent-accused,  having  purchased  electronic\nitems from the Appellant-company, issued the cheque  in  question  drawn  on\nUCO Bank, Tangi, Orissa which was presented by  the  Complainant-company  at\nState Bank of India, Ahmednagar Branch, Maharashtra  as  its  branch  office\nwas located at Ahmednagar.  The cheque was dishonoured by UCO  Bank,  Tangi,\nOrissa.  A Complaint was filed before JMFC, Ahmednagar.  An application  was\nfiled by the Respondent-accused  under  <a href=\"/doc/1219882/\" id=\"a_128\">Section  177</a>  CrPC  questioning  the\njurisdiction of the JMFC Ahmednagar, who held that since the  demand  notice\nwas issued from and the payment was  claimed  at  Ahmednagar,  he  possessed\njurisdiction to try the  Complaint.   The  High  Court  disagreed  with  the\nconclusion of the JMFC, Ahmednagar that  the  receipt  of  notice  and  non-\npayment of the demanded amount are factors which will have  prominence  over\nthe place wherefrom the notice of demand was  issued  and  held  that  JMFC,\nAhmednagar did not  have  the  territorial  jurisdiction  to  entertain  the\nComplaint.  In view of the foregoing discussion  on  the  issue  above,  the\nplace where the concerned cheque had been dishonoured, which in the case  in\nhand was Tangi, Orissa, the Appeal is allowed with the  direction  that  the\nComplaint be returned to the Complainant for further  action  in  accordance\nwith law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_30\">Crl.

The Appellant-complainant herein has its Registered  Office  in  Delhi\nfrom where the Respondents-accused are  also  carrying  on  their  business.\nThe cheques in question were issued by the Respondent No.2-accused drawn  on\nIndian Overseas Bank, Connaught Place, New Delhi.  However,  the  same  were\npresented and dishonoured  at  Nagpur,  Maharashtra  where  the  Complainant\nstates it also has an office. There is no clarification why the cheques  had\nnot been presented  in  Delhi  where  the  Complainant  had  its  Registered\nOffice, a choice which we think is capricious and  perfidious,  intended  to\ncause harassment.  Upon cheques having been  dishonoured  by  the  concerned\nbank at Delhi, five Complaints were filed before Judicial  Magistrate  First\nClass, Nagpur who heard the Complaints, and also recorded the  evidence  led\nby both the parties.  However, the JMFC,  Nagpur  acquitted  the  Respondent\nNo.2-accused on the ground  of  not  having  territorial  jurisdiction.   On\nappeals being filed before the High Court of Bombay,  the  judgment  of  the\nJMFC, Nagpur was partly set aside so far as the acquittal of the  Respondent\nNo.2-accused was concerned  and  it  was  ordered  that  the  Complaints  be\nreturned for filing before the proper Court.   In  view  of  the  conclusion\narrived at by us above, these Appeals are also dismissed.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">Crl. Appeal No. 1604   of 2014</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_34\">[Arising out of S.L.P.(Crl.)No.59 of 2013]\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_35\">25.   The cheque in question was drawn by the  Respondent-accused  on  State\nBank of Travancore, Delhi. However,  it  was  presented  by  the  Appellant-\ncomplainant at Aurangabad.  A Complaint was filed  before  JMFC,  Aurangabad\nwho issued process.  Respondent-accused filed an application  under  <a href=\"/doc/443138/\" id=\"a_129\">Section\n203</a> of CrPC  seeking  dismissal  of  the  Complaint.   The  application  was\ndismissed on the predication that  once  process  had  been  initiated,  the\nComplaint could not be dismissed.  On a writ  petition  being  filed  before\nthe High Court of  Bombay,  Aurangabad  Bench,  the  order  of  issuance  of\nprocess was set aside and the Complaint  was  ordered  to  be  returned  for\nbeing presented before a competent court having  jurisdiction  to  entertain\nthe same.  The High Court had correctly noted that the  objection  pertained\nto the territorial jurisdiction of the JMFC,  Aurangabad,  a  feature  which\nhad not been comprehensively grasped by the latter.  The  High  Court  noted\nthat the Registered Office of  the  Complainant  was  at  Chitegaon,  Tehsil\nPaithan, District Aurangabad whereas the Accused  was  transacting  business\nfrom Delhi.  The High Court pithily underscored that in paragraph 4  of  the\nComplaint it had been specifically contended that credit facility was  given\nto the Accused in Delhi, where the Complainant-company also had  its  branch\noffice.  The statutory notice had also emanated from Aurangabad, and it  had\nbeen demanded that payment should be made in that city within the  specified\ntime.  It was also the Complainant’s case  that  the  Invoice,  in  case  of\ndisputes, restricted jurisdiction to Aurangabad courts; that  intimation  of\nthe bouncing of the cheques was  received  at  Aurangabad.   It  is  however\nnecessary to underscore that the Accused  had  clarified  that  the  subject\ntransaction took place at Delhi  where  the  goods  were  supplied  and  the\noffending cheque was handed over to the  Complainant.   It  appears  that  a\nCivil Suit in respect of the recovery of the cheque amount has already  been\nfiled  in  Delhi.   We  may  immediately  reiterate  that   the   principles\npertaining to the cause  of  action  as  perceived  in  civil  law  are  not\nrelevant  in  criminal   prosecution.    Whilst   the   clause   restricting\njurisdiction  to  courts  at  Aurangabad  may  have   efficacy   for   civil\nproceedings, provided any  part  of  the  cause  of  action  had  arisen  in\nAurangabad, it has no bearing on the situs in criminal prosecutions.   Since\na Civil Suit is pending, we hasten to clarify that  we  are  not  expressing\nany  opinion  on  the  question  of  whether  the  courts  at  Delhi   enjoy\njurisdiction to try the Suit for recovery.  In the  impugned  judgment,  the\nHigh Court duly noted Bhaskaran   and  Harman.   However,  it  committed  an\nerror in analyzing the cause of action as well as the  covenant  restricting\njurisdiction to Aurangabad as these are relevant only  for  civil  disputes.\nHowever, the  impugned  judgment  is  beyond  interference  inasmuch  as  it\nconcludes that the JMFC, Aurangabad has no  jurisdiction  over  the  offence\ndescribed in the Complaint.  The Appeal is accordingly dismissed.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\">.......................................................J.\n                       [T.S.

I  entirely  agree   with   the\nconclusions which my  erudite  brother  has  drawn  based  on  a  remarkably\narticulate process of reasoning that illumines the draft  judgment  authored\nby him. I would all the same like to add a few lines of my own  not  because\nthe order as proposed leaves any rough edges  to  be  ironed  out  but  only\nbecause the question of law  that  arises  for  determination  is  not  only\nsubstantial but of considerable interest and importance for  the  commercial\nworld.  The fact that the view being taken by us strikes a  discordant  note\non certain aspects which have for long been considered  settled  by  earlier\ndecisions of this Court being     only  an  additional    reason  for    the\nmodest  addition     that  I     propose  to  make.  Of    these   decisions\nBhaskaran’s   case    stands  out  as  the  earliest  in  which  this  Court\nexamined the vexed question of territorial jurisdiction  of  the  Courts  to\ntry offences punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_130\">Section  138</a>  of  the  Negotiable  Instruments\nAct, 1881 (hereinafter called “<a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_131\">NI Act</a>”).  Bhaskaran’s case was  heard  by  a\ntwo-judge Bench of this Court who took the view  that  the  jurisdiction  to\ntry an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_132\">Section 138</a> could not be determined only  by  reference\nto the place where the cheque was dishonoured. That is because dishonour  of\nthe cheque was not by itself an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_133\">Section 138</a> of The  Negotiable\nInstruments Act, 1881, observed the Court.  The  offence  is  complete  only\nwhen the drawer fails to pay the cheque amount within the period of  fifteen\ndays stipulated under clause (c) of the proviso to <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_134\">Section 138</a> of  the  Act.\nHaving said that the Court recognised  the  difficulty  in  fixing  a  place\nwhere such failure could be said to have taken place.  It  could,  said  the\nCourt, be the place where the drawer resides or the place  where  the  payee\nresides or the place where either of them carries on  business.  To  resolve\nthis uncertainty the Court turned to <a href=\"/doc/1220064/\" id=\"a_135\">Sections 178</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1693935/\" id=\"a_136\">179</a> of the Cr.P.C.  to\nhold that since an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_137\">Section 138</a> can be completed only with  the\nconcatenation of five acts that constituted the components  of  the  offence\nany Court within whose jurisdiction any one  of  those  acts  was  committed\nwould have the jurisdiction to try the offence.  The Court held:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">“The offence under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_138\">Section 138</a> of the Act can be  completed  only  with  the\nconcatenation of a number of acts. The following  are  the  acts  which  are\ncomponents of the said offence: (1) drawing of the cheque, (2)  presentation\nof the cheque to the bank, (3) returning the cheque  unpaid  by  the  drawee\nbank, (4) giving notice in writing to the drawer  of  the  cheque  demanding\npayment of the cheque amount, (5) failure of  the  drawer  to  make  payment\nwithin 15 days of the receipt of the notice.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">It is  not  necessary  that  all  the  above  five  acts  should  have  been\nperpetrated at the same locality. It is possible that  each  of  those  five\nacts could be done at five different localities. But a concatenation of  all\nthe above five is a sine qua non for the completion  of  the  offence  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_139\">Section 138</a> of the Code. In this context a reference to  Section  178(d)  of\nthe Code is useful. It is extracted below:\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">“178. (a)-(c)    *     *    *\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">(d) where the offence consists of  several  acts  done  in  different  local\nareas, it may be enquired into or tried by a court having jurisdiction  over\nany of such local areas.”\n\n\nThus it is clear, if the five different acts were  done  in  five  different\nlocalities any one of the courts exercising jurisdiction in one of the  five\nlocal areas can become the place of trial for the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_140\">Section  138</a>\nof the Act. In other words, the complainant can  choose  any  one  of  those\ncourts having jurisdiction over any  one  of  the  local  areas  within  the\nterritorial limits of which any one of those five  acts  was  done.  As  the\namplitude stands so widened and so expansive  it  is  an  idle  exercise  to\nraise jurisdictional question regarding the offence  under  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_141\">Section  138</a>  of\nthe Act.”\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"499876\" id=\"span_20\">2.    Bhaskaran held the field for two years. The first  blow  to  the  view\ntaken by this Court in Bhaskaran’s case was dealt  by  a  three-Judge  Bench\ndecision in <a href=\"/doc/499876/\" id=\"a_142\">Shri Ishar Alloy Steels Ltd. v. Jayaswals  Neco  Ltd.</a>  (2001)  3\nSCC 609. The question that arose <a href=\"/doc/499876/\" id=\"a_143\">in that case</a> was whether the limitation  of\nsix months for presentation of a cheque for encashment was applicable viz-a-\nviz presentation to the bank of the  payee  or  that  of  the  drawer.  High\nCourts in this country had expressed conflicting opinions  on  the  subject.\nThis Court resolved the cleavage in those  pronouncements  by  holding  that\nthe cheque ought to be presented to the drawee bank  for  its  dishonour  to\nprovide a basis for prosecution under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_144\">Section 138</a>. The Court observed:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">“The use of the words “a  bank”  and  “the  bank”  in  the  section  are  an\nindicator of the intention of the legislature.  “The bank”  referred  to  in\nproviso (a) to the proviso to <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_145\">Section 138</a> of the Act would mean  the  drawee\nbank on which the cheque is drawn and not all  banks  where  the  cheque  is\npresented for collection including the bank of the payee,  in  whose  favour\nthe cheque is issued.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">It, however, does not mean that the cheque is always to be presented to  the\ndrawer’s bank on which the cheque is issued. However, a combined reading  of\n<a href=\"/doc/1485731/\" id=\"a_146\">Sections 3</a>, <a href=\"/doc/829357/\" id=\"a_147\">72</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_148\">138</a> of the Act would clearly show that the  law  mandates\nthe cheque to be presented at the bank on which it is drawn  if  the  drawer\nis to be held criminally liable. Such  presentation  is  necessarily  to  be\nmade within six months at the bank on which the  cheque  is  drawn,  whether\npresented personally or through another bank, namely,  the  collecting  bank\nof the payee.”\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">3.    Ishar  Alloy’s  case  (supra)  did  not  deal  with  the  question  of\njurisdiction of the Courts nor was Bhaskaran  noticed  by  the  Court  while\nholding that the presentation of the cheque ought to be  within  six  months\nto the drawee bank. But that does not, in our view,  materially  affect  the\nlogic underlying the pronouncement, which  pronouncement  coming  as  it  is\nfrom a bench of coordinate jurisdiction binds us.  When  logically  extended\nto the question of jurisdiction of the Court to take cognizance, we find  it\ndifficult to appreciate how a payee of the cheque  can  by  presentation  of\nthe cheque to his own bank confer jurisdiction upon  the  Court  where  such\nbank  is  situate.   If  presentation  referred  to  in  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_149\">Section  138</a>  means\npresentation to the “drawee bank”, there is  no  gainsaying  that  dishonour\nwould be localised and confined to the place where such  bank  is  situated.\nThe question is not whether or not the payee can deposit his cheque  in  any\nbank of his choice at any place.  The question is whether  by  such  deposit\ncan the payee confer jurisdiction on a Court of his choice?  Our  answer  is\nin the negative. The payee may and indeed can  present  the  cheque  to  any\nbank for collection from the drawee bank,  but  such  presentation  will  be\nvalid only if the drawee bank receives the cheque  for  payment  within  the\nperiod of six months from the date of issue.  Dishonour of the cheque  would\nbe localised at the place where the drawee bank  is  situated.  Presentation\nof the cheque at any place, we  have  no  manner  of  doubt,  cannot  confer\njurisdiction  upon  the  Court  within   whose   territorial   limits   such\npresentation may have taken place.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"463854\" id=\"span_21\">4.    Then came <a href=\"/doc/463854/\" id=\"a_150\">Harman Electronics (P) Ltd. v. National Panasonic India  (P)\nLtd.</a> (2009) 1 SCC 720. That was a case where  the  complaint  under  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_151\">Section\n138</a> was filed in a Delhi Court, only because the statutory  notice  required\nto be issued under the proviso to <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_152\">Section 138</a> was  issued  from  Delhi.   If\nBhaskaran was correctly decided, Harman should not have interfered with  the\nexercise of jurisdiction by the Delhi Court for issue of  a  notice  was  in\nterms of Bhaskaran, one of the factors that clothed the Court  in  Delhi  to\ntake cognizance and try the case. Harman did not do  so.  In  Harman’s  case\nthis Court, emphasized three distinct aspects.  Firstly, it said that  there\nwas a world of difference between issue of a notice, on the  one  hand,  and\nreceipt, thereof, on the other.  Issue of notice did  not  give  rise  to  a\ncause of action while receipt did, declared the Court.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\">5.    Secondly, the Court held  that  the  main  provision  of  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_153\">Section  138</a>\nstated what would  constitute  an  offence.  The  proviso  appended  thereto\nsimply imposed certain  further  conditions  which  must  be  fulfilled  for\ntaking cognizance of the offence. The  following  passage  deals  with  both\nthese aspects:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"463854\" id=\"span_22\">“It is one thing to say that sending of a notice is one of  the  ingredients\nfor maintaining the complaint but it is another thing to say that  dishonour\nof a cheque by itself constitutes an offence. For  the  purpose  of  proving\nits case that the accused had committed an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_154\">Section 138</a> of  the\nNegotiable Instruments Act, the  ingredients  thereof  are  required  to  be\nproved. What would constitute an offence is stated in  the  main  provision.\nThe proviso appended thereto, however, imposes  certain  further  conditions\nwhich are required to be fulfilled before cognizance of the offence  can  be\ntaken. If the ingredients for constitution  of  the  offence  <a href=\"/doc/463854/\" id=\"a_155\">laid  down  in</a>\nprovisos (a), (b)  and  (c)  appended  to  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_156\">Section  138</a>  of  the  Negotiable\nInstruments Act are intended to be applied in favour of the  accused,  there\ncannot be any doubt that receipt [pic]of  a  notice  would  ultimately  give\nrise to the cause of action for  filing  a  complaint.  As  it  is  only  on\nreceipt of the notice that the accused at his own peril may  refuse  to  pay\nthe amount. Clauses (b) and (c) of the  proviso  to  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_157\">Section  138</a>  therefore\nmust be read together. Issuance of notice would not by itself give  rise  to\na cause of action but communication of the notice would.”</span>\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\">6.    Thirdly, the Court held that if presentation of the  cheque  or  issue\nof  notice  was  to  constitute  a  good  reason  for  vesting  courts  with\njurisdiction to try offences under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_158\">Section 138</a>, it would lead to  harassment\nof the drawer of the cheques thereby  calling  for  the  need  to  strike  a\nbalance between the rights of the parties  to  the  transaction.  The  Court\nsaid:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">“We cannot, as things stand today, be oblivious of the fact that  a  banking\ninstitution holding several cheques signed by  the  same  borrower  can  not\nonly present the cheque for its encashment  at  four  different  places  but\nalso may serve notices from four different places so  as  to  enable  it  to\nfile four complaint cases at four different places. This only  causes  grave\nharassment to the accused. It is, therefore, necessary in  a  case  of  this\nnature to strike a balance between the right  of  the  complainant  and  the\nright of an accused  vis-à-vis  the  provisions  of  the  <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_159\">Code  of  Criminal\nProcedure</a>.”\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_43\">7.    Bhaskaran was, in the wake of the above, considerably diluted and  the\nlogic behind vesting of jurisdiction based  on  the  place  from  where  the\nnotice was issued questioned. Even presentation of the cheque  as  a  reason\nfor assumption  of  jurisdiction  to  take  cognizance  was  doubted  for  a\nunilateral act of the complainant/payee of  the  cheque  could  without  any\nfurther or supporting reason confer jurisdiction on  a  Court  within  whose\nterritorial limits  nothing  except  the  presentation  of  the  cheque  had\nhappened.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_44\">8.    Three recent decisions need be mentioned  at  this  stage  which  have\nfollowed Bhaskaran and attempted to reconcile the ratio of  that  case  with\nthe subsequent decisions in Ishar Alloy Steels and  Harman  Electronics.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"125009484\" id=\"span_23\">In\n<a href=\"/doc/125009484/\" id=\"a_160\">Nishant Aggarwal v. Kailash Kumar Sharma</a> (2013) 10 SCC  72  this  Court  was\nonce again dealing with a case where the complaint had been filed  in  Court\nat Bhiwani in Haryana within whose territorial jurisdiction the  complainant\nhad presented the cheque for encashment, although the cheque was drawn on  a\nbank at Gauhati in Assam. Relying upon the  view  taken  in  Bhaskaran  this\nCourt held that the Bhiwani Court had jurisdiction to deal with the  matter.</span>\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"529907\" id=\"span_24\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"463854\" id=\"span_25\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"499876\" id=\"span_26\">While saying so, the  Court  tried  to  distinguish  the  three-Judge  Bench\ndecision  in  <a href=\"/doc/499876/\" id=\"a_161\">Ishar  Alloy  Steels</a>  (supra)  and  that  rendered  in  <a href=\"/doc/463854/\" id=\"a_162\">Harman\nElectronics</a> case (supra) to hold that the ratio of those decisions  did  not\ndilute the principle stated in <a href=\"/doc/529907/\" id=\"a_163\">Bhaskaran</a> case.</span></span></span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"152281550\" id=\"span_27\">That  exercise  was  repeated\nby this Court in FIL Industries Ltd. v. Imtiyaz Ahmad Bhat (2014) 2 SCC  266\nand in <a href=\"/doc/152281550/\" id=\"a_164\">Escorts Ltd. v. Rama Mukherjee</a> (2014) 2 SCC 255  which  too  followed\nBhaskaran and held that complaint under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_165\">Section  138</a>  Negotiable  Instrument\nAct could be instituted at any  one  of  the  five  places  referred  to  in\nBhaskaran’s case.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_45\">9.    We have, with utmost respect to the Judges comprising the  Bench  that\nheard the above cases, found it difficult to follow suit  and  subscribe  to\nthe view stated in Bhasakaran.  The reasons are not far too seek and may  be\nstated right away.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_46\">10.   <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_166\">Section 138</a> is a penal provision  that  prescribes  imprisonment  upto\ntwo years and fine upto twice the cheque  amount.  It  must,  therefore,  be\ninterpreted strictly, for it is one of the accepted rules of  interpretation\nthat in a penal statute, the Courts would hesitate  to  ascribe  a  meaning,\nbroader than what the phrase would ordinarily bear.  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_167\">Section 138</a> is  in  two\nparts. The enacting part of the provision makes  it  abundantly  clear  that\nwhat constitutes an offence punishable with imprisonment and/or fine is  the\ndishonour of a cheque  for  insufficiency  of  funds  etc.  in  the  account\nmaintained by the drawer with a bank  for  discharge  of  a  debt  or  other\nliability whether in full or part. The language used  in  the  provision  is\nunambiguous and the ingredients of the offence clearly discernible viz.  (a)\nCheque is drawn by the accused on  an  account  maintained  by  him  with  a\nbanker. (b) The cheque amount is in discharge of a  debt  or  liability  and\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_47\">(c) The cheque is returned unpaid for insufficiency of  funds  or  that  the\namount exceeds the arrangement made with the bank. But for the proviso  that\ncomprises the second part of the provision,  any  dishonour  falling  within\nthe four corners of the enacting provision would be punishable without  much\nado. The proviso, however, draws an  exception  to  the  generality  of  the\nenacting part of the provision, by stipulating two steps that  ought  to  be\ntaken by the complainant holder of the cheque  before  the  failure  of  the\ndrawer gives to the former the cause of action to file a complaint  and  the\ncompetent Court to take cognizance of the offence. These steps are  distinct\nfrom the ingredients of the offence which  the  enacting  provision  creates\nand makes punishable. It follows that an offence  within  the  contemplation\nof <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_168\">Section 138</a> is complete with the  dishonour  of  the  cheque  but  taking\ncognizance of the same by any Court is forbidden so long as the  complainant\ndoes not have the cause of action to file a complaint  in  terms  of  clause\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_48\">(c) of the proviso read with <a href=\"/doc/595945/\" id=\"a_169\">Section 142</a> which runs as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">”<a href=\"/doc/595945/\" id=\"a_170\">Section 142</a>:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">Cognizance of offences. —Notwithstanding anything contained in the  <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_171\">Code  of\nCriminal Procedure</a>, 1973 (2 of 1974)—\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">(a) no court shall take cognizance of any offence punishable  under  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_172\">section\n138</a> except upon a complaint, in writing, made by the payee or, as  the  case\nmay be, the holder in due course of the cheque;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_49\">(b) such complaint is made within one month of the date on which  the  cause\nof action arises under clause (c) of the proviso to  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_173\">section  138</a>: [Provided\nthat the cognizance of a complaint may be  taken  by  the  Court  after  the\nprescribed period, if the  complainant  satisfies  the  Court  that  he  had\nsufficient cause for not making a complaint within such period.]\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_50\">(c) no court inferior to that of a Metropolitan  Magistrate  or  a  Judicial\nMagistrate of the  first  class  shall  try  any  offence  punishable  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_174\">section 138</a>.“\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_51\">11.   The following would constitute ‘cause of action’ referred  to  in  sub\nclause (b) above:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">The complainant has presented the cheque for payment within  the  period  of\nsix months from the date of the issue thereof.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">The complainant has demanded the payment  of  the  cheque  amount  from  the\ndrawer by issuing  a  written  notice  within  thirty  days  of  receipt  of\ninformation by him from the bank regarding the dishonour.\nThe drawer has failed to pay the cheque amount within fifteen  days  of  the\nreceipt of the notice.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_52\">12.   A proper understanding of the scheme underlying  the  provision  would\nthus make it abundantly clear  that  while  the  offence  is  complete  upon\ndishonour, prosecution for such offence is deferred till the time the  cause\nof action for such prosecution accrues to the complainant.  The  proviso  in\nthat sense, simply postpones the actual prosecution  of  the  offender  till\nsuch time he fails to pay the amount within the statutory period  prescribed\nfor such payment.  There is, in our opinion, a  plausible  reason  why  this\nwas done.  The Parliament in its wisdom considered it  just  and  proper  to\ngive to the drawer of a dishonoured cheque an  opportunity  to  pay  up  the\namount,  before  permitting  his  prosecution  no  matter  the  offence   is\ncomplete, the moment the cheque was dishonoured. The law has to that  extent\ngranted a concession and prescribed a scheme under which dishonour need  not\nnecessarily lead to penal consequence if the drawer makes amends  by  making\npayment within the time stipulated once the dishonour is  notified  to  him.\nPayment of the cheque amount within  the  stipulated  period  will  in  such\ncases diffuse the element of criminality  that  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_175\">Section  138</a>  attributes  to\ndishonour by way of a legal fiction implicit in the use of the words  “shall\nbe deemed to have committed an offence”.  The drawer would by  such  payment\nstand absolved by the penal consequences of dishonour.  This scheme  may  be\nunique to <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_176\">Section 138</a> NI Act,  but  there  is  hardly  any  doubt  that  the\nParliament is competent to  legislate so to provide for situations  where  a\ncheque is dishonoured even without any criminal intention  on  the  part  of\nthe drawer.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"272690\" id=\"span_28\">13.   The scheme of <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_177\">Section 138</a> thus not only saves the  honest  drawer  but\ngives a chance to  even  the  dishonest  ones  to  make  amends  and  escape\nprosecution.  Compliance with the provision is, in that  view,  a  mandatory\nrequirement. (See <a href=\"/doc/272690/\" id=\"a_178\">C.C. Alavi Haji v. Palapetty Muhammed and  Another</a>  (2007)\n6 SCC 555).</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_54\">14.   Harman in that view correctly held  that  “what  would  constitute  an\noffence is stated in the  main  provision.   The  proviso  appended  thereto\nhowever  imposes  certain  further  conditions  which  are  required  to  be\nfulfilled  before  cognizance  of  the  offence  can  be  taken.”   If   the\nParliament intended to make the conditions stipulated in the  proviso,  also\nas ingredients of the offence, the provision would  have  read  differently.\nIt would then have specifically added the words “and the drawer has  despite\nreceipt of a notice demanding the payment of the amount, failed to  pay  the\nsame within a period of fifteen days from the date of such  demand  made  in\nwriting by a notice”.  That, however, is not how the enacting  provision  of\n<a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_179\">Section 138</a> reads.  The  legislature  has,  it  is  obvious,  made  a  clear\ndistinction between what would constitute an offence and what would give  to\nthe complainant the cause of action  to  file  a  complaint  for  the  court\ncompetent to take cognizance.   That  a  proviso  is  an  exception  to  the\ngeneral rule is well settled.   A  proviso  is  added  to  an  enactment  to\nqualify or create an exception to what is contained in  the  enactment.   It\ndoes  not  by  itself  state  a  general  rule.

In conclusion, we may refer to Maxwell, “Interpretation  of  Statutes”\nEdn. 12, 1969, on P. 189-190 which states that  it is a general finding  and\npractice “that inconsistencies can be avoided by applying the  general  rule\nthat the words of a proviso are not to be taken “absolutely in their  strict\nliteral sense” [R v. Dimbdin (1910)] but that a  proviso  is  “of  necessity\n... limited  in  its  operation  to  the  ambit  of  the  section  which  it\nqualifies” [Lloyds and Scottish Finance Ltd  v.  Modern  Cars  and  Canavans\n(Kingston) Ltd.(1966)]. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"113938777\" id=\"span_45\">And, so far as that  section  itself  is  concerned,\nthe proviso receives a restricted construction: where  the  section  confers\npowers, “it would be contrary to the ordinary  operation  of  a  proviso  to\ngive it an effect which would cut down those powers beyond  what  compliance\nwith the  proviso  renders  necessary.”  [<a href=\"/doc/113938777/\" id=\"a_202\">Re  Tabrisky  v.

Bhaskaran,  in  our  view,  reads  the  proviso  as  prescribing  the\ningredients of the offence instead of treating it as  an  exception  to  the\ngenerality of the enacting part by stipulating further conditions  before  a\ncompetent Court may take cognizance of the same.  Seen in the light  of  the\nprovisions of <a href=\"/doc/595945/\" id=\"a_203\">Section 142</a> of the Act, the proviso simply defers  prosecution\nof the offender  till  the  conditions  prescribed  therein  are  satisfied.\nBhaskaran does not view the matter in that perspective while <a href=\"/doc/463854/\" id=\"a_204\">Harman</a>  (supra)\ndoes.  We find ourselves in respectful agreement with the view  in  Harman’s\ncase on this aspect.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_67\">27.   In  Bhaskaran,  this   Court   resolved the confusion as to the  place\nof commission of the offence by relying upon <a href=\"/doc/1219882/\" id=\"a_205\">Sections  177</a>  to  <a href=\"/doc/1693935/\" id=\"a_206\">179</a>  of  the\nCr.P.C.  But the confusion arises only if one were to treat the  proviso  as\nstipulating the ingredients of  the  offence.  Once  it  is  held  that  the\nconditions  precedent  for  taking  cognizance  are  not   the   ingredients\nconstituting the offence of dishonour of the cheque, there is  no  room  for\nany such confusion or  vagueness  about  the  place  where  the  offence  is\ncommitted.  Applying the general rule recognised under <a href=\"/doc/1219882/\" id=\"a_207\">Section  177</a>  of  the\nCr.P.C. that all offences are local, the place where  the  dishonour  occurs\nis the place for commission of the  offence  vesting  the  Court  exercising\nterritorial jurisdiction over the area with the power to try  the  offences.\nHaving said that we must hasten to add, that  in  cases  where  the  offence\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_208\">Section 138</a> is out of the offences committed in a  single  transaction\nwithin the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/187287/\" id=\"a_209\">Section 220 (1)</a> of the Cr.P.C. then the  offender  may\nbe charged with and tried at one trial for every such offence and  any  such\ninquiry or trial may be conducted by any Court competent to enquire into  or\ntry any of the offences as provided by Section 184 of the  Code.   So  also,\nif an offence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_210\">Section 138</a> of the  Act  is  committed  as  a\npart of single transaction with the  offence  of  cheating  and  dishonestly\ninducing delivery of property then in terms of Section  182  (1)  read  with\n<a href=\"/doc/1238664/\" id=\"a_211\">Sections 184</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1595114/\" id=\"a_212\">220</a> of the Cr.P.C. such offence may be tried either at  the\nplace where the inducement took place or where the cheque  forming  part  of\nthe same transaction was dishonoured or at  the  place  where  the  property\nwhich the person cheated was dishonestly induced to deliver or at the  place\nwhere the accused received such property.  These provisions  make  it  clear\nthat in the commercial world a party who is cheated and induced  to  deliver\nproperty on the basis of a cheque which is dishonoured  has  the  remedy  of\ninstituting  prosecution  not  only  at  the  place  where  the  cheque  was\ndishonoured which at times may be a place other than  the  place  where  the\ninducement or cheating takes place but also at the place where  the  offence\nof cheating was committed. To that extent the provisions of Chapter XIII  of\nthe Code will  bear  relevance  and  help  determine  the  place  where  the\noffences can be tried.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_68\">28.   We may at this stage refer to two other decisions of this Court  which\nbear some relevance to the question that falls  for  our  determination.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"372711\" id=\"span_47\">In\n<a href=\"/doc/372711/\" id=\"a_213\">Sadanandan Bhadran v.

On each such presentation of  the  cheque  and  its\ndishonour a fresh right - and not cause of action – accrues in  his  favour.\nHe may, therefore, without taking pre-emptory action  in  exercise  of  such\nright under clause (b) of <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_215\">Section 138</a> go on presenting the  cheque  so  long\nas the cheque is valid for payment.

This Court observed:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">“On a careful analysis of the above section, it is seen that its  main  part\ncreates an offence when a cheque is returned by the bank unpaid for  any  of\nthe reasons mentioned therein.

It is only when all the [pic]above  three  conditions\nare satisfied that a prosecution can  be  launched  for  the  offence  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_227\">Section 138</a>. So far as the first condition is concerned, clause (a)  of  the\nproviso to  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_228\">Section  138</a>  does  not  put  any  embargo  upon  the  payee  to\nsuccessively  present  a  dishonoured  cheque  during  the  period  of   its\nvalidity. This apart, in the course  of  business  transactions  it  is  not\nuncommon for a cheque being returned due to insufficient  funds  or  similar\nsuch reasons and being presented again by the payee after sometime,  on  his\nown volition or at the request of the drawer, in expectation that  it  would\nbe encashed. Needless to say, the primary interest of the payee  is  to  get\nhis money and not prosecution of the drawer, recourse  to  which,  normally,\nis taken out of compulsion and not choice. For the above reasons it must  be\nheld that a cheque can be presented any number of times  during  the  period\nof its validity. Indeed that is also the consistent view  of  all  the  High\nCourts except that of the  Division  Bench  of  the  Kerala  High  Court  in\nKumaresan1 which struck a discordant note with the observation that for  the\nfirst dishonour of the cheque, only a prosecution can be launched for  there\ncannot be more than one cause of action for prosecution.”\n                                                         (emphasis supplied)\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_71\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"132373854\" id=\"span_52\">30.   <a href=\"/doc/132373854/\" id=\"a_229\">MSR Leathers</a> (supra) also looked  at  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_230\">Section  138</a>  and  held  that  a\ncomplaint could be filed under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_231\">Section 138</a> after cause of action  to  do  so\nhad accrued in terms of clause (c) of  the  proviso  to  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_232\">Section  138</a>  which\nhappens no sooner the drawer of the cheque fails to make the payment of  the\ncheque amount to the payee within fifteen days in terms  of  clause  (b)  to\nproviso to <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_233\">Section 138</a>.  MSR Leathers was not so  much  concerned  with  the\nquestion whether the  proviso  stipulated  ingredients  of  the  offence  or\nconditions precedent for filing a  complaint.  It  was  primarily  concerned\nwith the question whether the second or  successive  dishonour  followed  by\nstatutory notices and failure of the drawer to make payment could be made  a\nbasis for launching prosecution  against  the  drawer.   That  question,  as\nnoticed above, was answered  in  the  affirmative  holding  that  successive\ncause of action could arise if there were successive dishonours followed  by\nstatutory notices as required under the law and successive  failure  of  the\ndrawer to make the payment. MSR Leathers cannot, therefore, be taken  as  an\nauthority  for  determining  whether  the  proviso   stipulates   conditions\nprecedent  for  launching  a  prosecution  or  ingredients  of  the  offence\npunishable under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_234\">Section 138</a>.  Sadanandan Bhadran may  have  been  overruled\nto the extent it held that successive causes of  action  cannot  be  made  a\nbasis for prosecution, but the distinction between  the  ingredient  of  the\noffence,  on  the  one  hand,  and  conditions   precedent   for   launching\nprosecution, on the  other,  drawn  in  the  said  judgement  has  not  been\nfaulted. That distinction permeates the  pronouncements  of  this  Court  in\nSadanandan Bhadran and MSR Leathers.</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1653208\" id=\"span_53\">High  Court  of  Kerala  has,  in  our\nview, correctly interpreted <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_235\">Section 138</a> of the Act in  <a href=\"/doc/1653208/\" id=\"a_236\">Kairali  Marketing  &amp;\nProcessing Cooperative Society Ltd. V. Pullengadi Service  Cooperative  Ltd.</a>\n(2007) 1 KLT 287 when it said:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">“It is evident from the language of <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_237\">Section 138</a> of the  N.I.  Act  that  the\ndrawer is deemed to have committed the offence when a cheque issued  by  him\nof  the  variety  contemplated  under  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_238\">Section 138</a> is  dishonoured  for  the\nreasons contemplated in the Section. The crucial words are &quot;is  returned  by\nthe bank unpaid&quot;. When that happens, such person shall  be  deemed  to  have\ncommitted the offence. With the deeming in  the  body  of  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_239\">Section 138</a>,  the\noffence is already committed or deemed to have  been  committed.  A  careful\nreading of the body of <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_240\">Section 138</a> cannot  lead  to  any  other  conclusion.\nProviso to <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_241\">Section138</a> according to me only  insists  on  certain  conditions\nprecedent which have to be satisfied if the person who  is  deemed  to  have\ncommitted the offence were to be prosecuted  successfully.  The  offence  is\nalready committed when the cheque is returned by the bank. But the cause  of\naction for prosecution will be available to the  complainant  not  when  the\noffence is committed but only after the conditions precedent  enumerated  in\nthe proviso are satisfied. After the  offence  is  committed,  only  if  the\noption given to avoid the prosecution under the proviso is  not  availed  of\nby the offender, can the aggrieved person get a right or  course  of  action\nto prosecute the offender. The offence is already deemed  and  declared  but\nthe offender can be prosecuted only when the  requirements  of  the  proviso\nare satisfied. The cause of action for prosecution will arise only when  the\nperiod stipulated in the proviso elapses  without  payment.  Ingredients  of\nthe offence have got to be distinguished from the conditions  precedent  for\nvalid initiation of prosecution.”\n\nThe stipulations in the proviso must also be  proved  certainly  before  the\noffender can be successfully prosecuted. But in the strict  sense  they  are\nnot ingredients of the deemed offence under the body of  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_242\">Section 138</a> of  the\nN.I. Act, though the said stipulations; must also be proved  to  ensure  and\nclaim conviction. It is in this sense that it is said that the proviso  does\nnot make or unmake the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_243\">Section 138</a> of the N.I.  Act.  That  is\nalready done by the body of the Sections. This dispute  as  to  whether  the\nstipulations    of    the    proviso    are    conditions    precedent    or\ningredients/components of the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_244\">Section 138</a> of the N.I. Act  may\nonly be academic in most cases. Undoubtedly the  ingredients  stricto  sensu\nas also the conditions precedent will have to be established  satisfactorily\nin all cases. Of course in an appropriate case it may have to be  considered\nwhether substantial compliance of the conditions precedent can  be  reckoned\nto  be  sufficient  to  justify  a  conviction.  Be  that  as  it  may,  the\ndistinction between the ingredients and conditions  precedent  is  certainly\nreal and existent. That distinction is certainly  vital  while  ascertaining\ncomplicity of an indictee  who  faces  indictment  in  a  prosecution  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_245\">Section 138</a> with the aid of <a href=\"/doc/686130/\" id=\"a_246\">Section 141</a> of the N.I. Act.  That  is  how  the\nquestion assumes such crucial significance here.”\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_72\">31.

Prosecution  in\nsuch cases can, therefore, be launched against  the  drawer  of  the  cheque\nonly before the Court within whose jurisdiction the  dishonour  takes  place\nexcept  in  situations  where  the  offence  of  dishonour  of  the   cheque\npunishable under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_254\">Section 138</a> is committed along with  other  offences  in  a\nsingle transaction within the meaning of Section 220(1)  read  with  <a href=\"/doc/1238664/\" id=\"a_255\">Section\n184</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure or is covered  by  the  provisions  of\nSection 182(1) read with Sections 184 and 220 thereof.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_73\">32.   Before parting with this aspect of  the  matter,  we  need  to  remind\nourselves that an avalanche of cases  involving  dishonour  of  cheques  has\ncome upon the Magistracy of this country. The number of  such  cases  as  of\nOctober 2008 were estimated to be more than 38 lakhs by the  Law  Commission\nof India in its 213th Report. The result is that cases  involving  dishonour\nof cheque is in all major cities choking the criminal justice system at  the\nMagistrate’s level.  Courts  in  the  four  metropolitan  cities  and  other\ncommercially important centres are particularly burdened as  the  filing  of\nsuch cases is in very large numbers. More than five  lakh  such  cases  were\npending in criminal courts  in  Delhi  alone  as  of  1st  June  2008.   The\nposition is no different in other cities where large  number  of  complaints\nare filed under<a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_256\"> S.138</a> not necessarily because the offence  is  committed  in\nsuch cities but because multinational and  other  companies  and  commercial\nentities and agencies choose these places for filing the complaints  for  no\nbetter reason than  the  fact  that  notices  demanding  payment  of  cheque\namounts were issued from such cities  or  the  cheques  were  deposited  for\ncollection in their banks in those  cities.  Reliance  is  often  placed  on\nBhaskaran’s case to justify institution of such cases far  away  from  where\nthe transaction forming basis of the dishonoured cheque had taken place.  It\nis not uncommon to find  complaints  filed  in  different  jurisdiction  for\ncheques dishonoured in the same transaction and  at  the  same  place.  This\nprocedure is more often than not intended to use such oppressive  litigation\nto achieve the collateral purpose of extracting money from  the  accused  by\ndenying him a fair opportunity to contest the claim by  dragging  him  to  a\ndistant place.  Bhaskaran’s case could never have intended to  give  to  the\ncomplainant/payee of the cheque such an advantage. Even so,  experience  has\nshown that the view taken in Bhaskaran’s case permitting prosecution at  any\none of the five different places indicated therein has failed  not  only  to\nmeet the approval of other  benches  dealing  with  the  question  but  also\nresulted in hardship, harassment and inconvenience to the  accused  persons.\nWhile anyone issuing a cheque is and ought to be  made  responsible  if  the\nsame is dishonoured despite compliance with  the  provisions  stipulated  in\nthe proviso, the Court ought to avoid an interpretation that can be used  as\nan instrument of oppression by one of the parties. The unilateral acts of  a\ncomplainant in presenting a cheque at a place of his  choice  or  issuing  a\nnotice for payment of the dishonoured amount cannot  in  our  view  arm  the\ncomplainant with the power to choose the place of trial. Suffice it to  say,\nthat not only on the Principles of Interpretation of Statutes but  also  the\npotential mischief which an erroneous interpretation can cause in  terms  of\ninjustice and harassment to the accused the view taken  in  the  Bhaskaran’s\ncase needs to be revisited as we have done in foregoing paragraphs.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_74\">33.
