The present appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated\n26.05.2014 passed by Sh. Vikram, MM-03, South-West District, Dwarka\nCourts, Delhi in CC No.1798/2014 under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 138</a> of Negotiable\nInstruments Act (NI Act). The respondent/accused was acquitted by the\nimpugned judgment and the complaint preferred by the appellant has been\ndismissed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">5.     The case of the complainant, as set out in the complaint is that the\ncomplainant is a member of the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India,\ndealing in capital market. Accused No. 1 is the name of a business\nenterprise of a Hindu Undivided Family (HUF), dealing in capital markets,\nthrough accused no. 2, its Karta. The complainant claims that at the request\nof accused no. 1 through accused no. 2, and in consideration of issuance of a\ncheque bearing No. 501416 dated 22.6.96 for Rs. 14 Lacs drawn on Oriental\nBank of Commerce, Tagore Garden Branch, New Delhi - 110 027, and\ndeposit of certain shares with the complainant as security, the accused were\nallowed to conduct the sale and purchase of shares on credit basis with the\ncomplainant, with the understanding that the aforesaid shares and cheque\ncan be encashed by the complainant, in case of failure of the accused to\nmeet its liability if and when it arises due to the share transactions\nundertaken by the accused through the complainant.             The accused\nconducted several transactions of shares with the complainant as per the\ndetailed bills and statement of Accounts placed on record, and more than\nRs. 14 Lacs were found payable and outstanding against the accused.\nHence as per the request of the Accused, the complainant presented the said\ncheque for encashment to its bank, i.e. the Bank of India, Rajouri Garden,\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">Crl.

On their failure to pay the outstanding amount, a statutory notice\ndated 08.08.1996 was served upon the accused. The accused failed to pay\nthe amount of the cheque within the prescribed statutory period.\nAccordingly, the complainant preferred the complaint under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 138</a> NI\nAct through Sh. Dilip Kumar Agarwal, a Director duly authorised by its\nBoard of Directors. The complainant had claimed that the security cheque\nof Rs.14 lacs was given to meet the liability which was likely to arise in\nfuture, and on the date of presentation there was a liability of more than\nRs.14 lacs. The complainant claimed that the cheque was presented with\nprior notice to the accused.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_8\">7.     Upon being summoned, the accused entered appearance.           The\naccused was served with the notice on 08.10.1998 under <a href=\"/doc/429078/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 251</a> CrPC\nfor the offence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 138</a> NI Act, to which the accused\npleaded not guilty, and claimed trial.   The parties led their respective\nevidence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">8.     Sh. Dilip Kumar Agarwal examined himself as CW-1 and Sita Ram\nPratap was examined as CW-2. The statement of accused no. 2 was\nrecorded under Section 313 Cr PC.        He denied all the incriminating\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">Crl. L.P. 558/2014                                             Page 3 of 31</span>\n evidence. He stated that the cheque was not issued to discharge any liability\nand that the complaint was false. He claimed that a blank cheque had been\nissued to the complainant. The accused opted to lead defence evidence.\nThe accused summoned Gautam Gupta, Asstt. Manager of NSE as DW-1\nand accused No.2 examined himself as DW-2.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">9.     The learned MM acquitted the accused on the premise that the cheque\nin question was given by the accused as security. Admittedly, on the date of\ncheque, i.e. 22.06.96 there was no transaction between the parties and,\nadmittedly, there was no debt or other liability existing on that date.\nTherefore, it was held that the cheque in question was not issued in\ndischarge of an existing debt or other liability. The learned MM relied on\nthe decision of the Supreme Court in M/s Indus Airways Pvt. Ltd. vs M/s\nMagnum Aviation Pvt. Ltd., IV (2014) SLT 321, wherein the Supreme\nCourt had observed:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">       &quot;....the fine distinction between civil liability and criminal\n       liability under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 138</a> of the N.I. Act. If at the time of\n       entering into a contract, it is one of the conditions of the\n       contract that the purchaser has to pay the amount in advance\n       and there is breach of such condition then purchaser may have\n       to make good the loss that might have occasioned to the seller\n       but that does not create a criminal liability under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 138</a>.\n       For a criminal liability to be made out under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 138</a>,\n       there should be legally enforceable debt or other liability\n       subsisting on the date of drawal of the cheque.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">                                                  (Emphasis supplied)\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_12\">10.    Learned Counsel for the Petitioner submits that the Trial Court has\nwrongly placed reliance on Indus Airways (supra), as the facts of that case\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">Crl. L.P. 558/2014                                                Page 4 of 31</span>\n were very different and the observations of the Supreme Court have to be\nviewed in the light of the background facts of the case. In that case, the\npurchase order had been cancelled by the drawer of the cheque given as\nadvance, who was also the purchaser. The supply of goods had not been\neffected by the seller/ holder of the cheque.       Therefore, there was no\nexisting ascertained liability or debt against the accused on the date the\ncheque was presented for encashment to the Bank. Learned counsel submits\nthat, in contrast, in the present case, on the date of presentation of the\naforesaid cheque, there was an ascertained legal liability existing against the\naccused no. 1/ HUF. The liability was for an amount which was more than\nRs. 14 Lakhs. Since the said liability was existing, the complainant was\nentitled to enforce the security furnished by the accused, on the strength of\nwhich the accused were permitted to transact the share purchase/ sale\nbusiness by the complainant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1623811\" id=\"span_6\">11.    Ld. Counsel for Petitioner relies on <a href=\"/doc/1623811/\" id=\"a_8\">I.C.D.S. Ltd. vs. Beena Shabeer</a>,\n2002 (2) SCC 426.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1623811\" id=\"span_7\">He submits that in <a href=\"/doc/1623811/\" id=\"a_9\">Beena Shabeer</a> (supra), the Supreme\nCourt held that security cheques would fall within the purview of <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_10\">Section\n138</a> NI Act, and a person cannot escape his liability. As such, when there is\nan existing liability on the date of presentation of the cheque, and the\n„security cheques‟ issued are be dishonoured, the accused will be liable\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 138</a> NI Act.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1623811\" id=\"span_8\">He submits that while making the above quoted\nobservations in Indus Airways (supra) - which are obiter dicta, as they were\nnot necessary for a decision of the case under consideration before the\nSupreme Court, the earlier decision in <a href=\"/doc/1623811/\" id=\"a_12\">Beena Shabeer</a> (supra) was not\nbrought to the notice of the Supreme Court.</span>\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">Crl. L.P. 558/2014                                                  Page 5 of 31</span>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_14\"> 12.    On the other hand, learned Counsel for the Respondent has placed\nreliance on Collage Culture vs. Apparel Export Promotion Council, 2007\n(99) DRJ 251to submit that Courts have recognised the distinction between\nthe two kinds of cheques - one, issued in discharge of a debt in presenti, but\npayable in future, and the other issued in respect of a debt which comes into\nexistence on occurrence of a contingent event, and is not in existence on the\ndate of issue of the cheque. The latter cheque would be by way of security\ncheque, and would not be covered by <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">13.    He further submits that in Collage Culture (supra), this Court defined\nthe word „due‟ as „outstanding on the relevant date‟. This court held that\ndebt has to be in „existence‟ as a crystallized demand akin to liquidated\ndamages, and not a demand which may, or may not, come into existence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_16\">14.    Ld. Counsel for Respondent submits that the cheque in the present\ncase is a security cheque as no liability existed on the date of its issuance,\nand the liability allegedly came into existence subsequently on account of\nalleged transactions undertaken by the accused. Since the liability depended\non a contingency, the aforesaid cheque - issued as security, will not be\ncovered under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 138</a> of NI Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">15.    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"144941788\" id=\"span_10\">In <a href=\"/doc/144941788/\" id=\"a_15\">Suresh Chandra Goyal Vs. Amit Singhal, Crl</a>. Appeal\nNos.601/2015 decided on 14.05.2015, this Court had occasion to consider\nthe defence of &quot;security cheque&quot;. In that case the complainant invested\nmonies, from time to time, in the business of the accused. A sum of Rs.3\nLakhs was outstanding after accounting for the monies returned by the\naccused.    The accused entered into a MOU for repayment of the said\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">Crl. L.P. 558/2014                                                 Page 6 of 31</span>\n outstanding amount in 6 monthly instalments of Rs.50,000/- each. The\naccused issued six security cheques of Rs.50,000/-, which were to be\nreturned upon payment of the corresponding instalment.          While three\ninstalments were admittedly received by the complainant, he claimed that\nthe remaining three were not paid. The corresponding security cheques\nwere banked; dishonoured upon presentation, and; after issuance of\nstatutory notice, the complaint under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 138</a> NI Act filed due to non-\npayment. This Court, inter alia, observed as follows:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">       &quot;28. There is no magic in the word &quot;security cheque&quot;, such\n       that, the moment the accused claims that the dishonoured\n       cheque (in respect whereof a complaint under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 138</a> of\n       the Act is preferred) was given as a &quot;security cheque&quot;, the\n       Magistrate would acquit the accused. The expression &quot;security\n       cheque&quot; is not a statutorily defined expression in the <a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_18\">NI Act</a>.\n       <a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_19\">The NI Act</a> does not per se carve out an exception in respect of\n       a „security cheque‟ to say that a complaint in respect of such a\n       cheque would not be maintainable.          There can be mirade\n       situations in which the cheque issued by the accused may be\n       called as security cheque, or may have been issued by way of a\n       security, i.e. to provide an assurance or comfort to the drawee,\n       that in case of failure of the primary consideration on the due\n       date, or on the happening (or not happening) of a contingency,\n       the security may be enforced. While in some situations, the\n       dishonor of such a cheque may attract the penal provisions\n       contained in <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 138</a> of the Act, in others it may not.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_18\">16.    This Court analysed the meaning of the word &quot;security&quot; and the\nquestion as to what does the issuance of a security cheque entail, and, if\nthere is no specific agreement touching upon the said aspect, what would\nthe rights and obligations of the parties qua a security cheque, in case the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">Crl.

The relevant extract reads as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">       &quot;57. ..... ..... ..... The Black‟s Law Dictionary (6th edition), inter\n       alia, defines &quot;security&quot; to mean:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">              &quot;Protection; assurance; Indemnification. The\n              term is usually applied to an obligation, pledge,\n              mortgage, deposit, lien, etc., given by a debtor in\n              order to assure the payment or performance of\n              his debt, by furnishing the creditor with a resource\n              to be used in case of failure in the principal\n              obligation. Collateral given by debtor to secure\n              loan.     Document that indicates evidence of\n              indebtedness. The name is also sometimes given to\n              one who becomes surety or guarantor for\n              another&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_19\">                                               (Emphasis supplied)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_20\">       58. Similarly, the word &quot;security&quot; is defined in the Shorter\n       Oxford English Dictionary (5th edition), inter alia, to mean:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">              &quot;Property etc. deposited or pledged by or on\n              behalf of a person as a guarantee of the\n              fulfillment of an obligation (as an appearance in\n              court or the payment of a debt) and liable to\n              forfeit in the event of default&quot;.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_21\">                                               (Emphasis supplied)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">       59. Thus, when one party gives a security to the other,\n       implicit in the said transaction is the understanding that in case\n       of failure of the principal obligation, the security may be\n       enforced.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\">       60. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1577621\" id=\"span_13\">In <a href=\"/doc/1577621/\" id=\"a_21\">V.K.

L.P. 558/2014                                                      Page 8 of 31</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">               &quot;The term &quot;security&quot; signifies that which makes\n              secure or certain. It makes the money more\n              assured in its payment or more readily recoverable\n              as distinguished from, as for example, a mere IOU,\n              which is only evidence of a debt, and the word is\n              not confined to a document which gives a charge\n              on specific property, but includes personal\n              securities for money. (See Chetumal Bulchand v.\n              Noorbhoy Jafeerji, AIR 1928 Sind 89). It is a word\n              of general import signifying an assurance&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_24\">       61. Thus, in my view, it makes no difference whether, or not,\n       there is an express understanding between the parties that the\n       security may be enforced in the event of failure of the debtor to\n       pay the debt or discharge other liability on the due date. Even\n       if there is no such express agreement, the mere fact that the\n       debtor has given a security in the form of a post dated cheque\n       or a current cheque with the agreement that it is a security for\n       fulfillment of an obligation to be discharged on a future date\n       itself, is sufficient to read into the arrangement, an agreement\n       that in case of failure of the debtor to make payment on the due\n       date, the security cheque may be presented for payment, i.e. for\n       recovery of the due debt. If that were not so, there would be no\n       purpose of obtaining a security cheque from the debtor. A\n       security cheque is issued by the debtor so that the same may be\n       presented for payment. Otherwise, it would not be a security\n       cheque.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">17.    This Court also analysed several decisions of the Supreme Court, of\nthis Court, and of other High Courts relevant for determination of the issue\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_26\">- whether a dishonoured security cheque could be the foundation of a\ncomplaint under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act.

The cheque in question\n       was issued by the guarantor towards part payment to the\n       appellant/complainant. The same was returned unpaid on\n       account of insufficient funds. The issue raised before the\n       Supreme Court was whether a complaint under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 138</a> of\n       the NI Act was maintainable in respect of the said cheque. The\n       High Court had come to the conclusion that when a cheque was\n       issued as security, no complaint would lie under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 138</a> of\n       the NI Act, since the cheque issued could not be said to be for\n       the purpose of discharging any debt or liability.

These three words were held to be significant.

The Supreme Court also emphasized that\n       the legislature had been careful enough to use not only the\n       expression &quot;discharge, in whole or in part, of any debt&quot;, but\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">Crl.

Any contra interpretation would\n              defeat the intent of the legislature.

However,\n       they were to be returned upon receipt of payment by the\n       respondent/seller. In case payment was not forthcoming, the\n       security cheques were considered as consideration towards\n       supply of goods, and the respondent would bank the cheques.\n       The cheques in question had similarly been banked since\n       payment was not otherwise made by the petitioner/accused on\n       the expiry of the credit period.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1623811\" id=\"span_29\">56.

The\n       appellants before the Supreme Court were the purchasers who\n       had placed purchase orders and issued post dated cheques in\n       favour of the respondent towards advance payment. One of the\n       terms and conditions of the contract was that the entire\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">Crl.

The\n       supplier claimed that the advance payment had to be made, as\n       it had to procure the parts from abroad. The cheques were\n       dishonoured upon presentation on the ground that the\n       purchasers had stopped payment. Thereafter, the purchasers\n       cancelled the purchase orders and requested for return of the\n       cheques. The respondent/seller insisted on collecting payment\n       and initiated a complaint under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_86\">Section 138</a> of NI Act after\n       sending a demand notice.</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"82687574\" id=\"span_56\">51.

It\n       was held that if the cheque is issued as an advance payment for\n       purchase of goods and, for any reason, purchase order is not\n       carried to its logical conclusion either because of its\n       cancellation or otherwise, and the material or goods for which\n       the purchase order was placed is not supplied, the cheque could\n       not be held to have been drawn for an existing debt or liability.\n       It was held that the payment made by a cheque in the nature of\n       advance payment indicates that at the time of drawal of cheque,\n       there was no existing liability.

As noticed above, in <a href=\"/doc/77590271/\" id=\"a_120\">Indus Airways</a> (supra) the Supreme Court was\nconsidering the fact situation wherein the purchase order was not executed\nwith supply of the contracted goods and, thus, the cheque issued by the\npurchaser towards advance payment was held as not covered by <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_121\">Section 138</a>\nof NI Act.     But what happens, where the purchaser while placing the\npurchase order issues in advance a post-dated cheque; goods/ services are\nsupplied in terms of the contract, and; the post-dated cheque upon\npresentation on the due date gets dishonoured. The Supreme Court was not\ndealing with such a fact situation. Could it be said that, because there was\nno pre-existing or pre-determined debt or other liability on the date of issue\nof the cheque by the purchaser (as the goods/ services were supplied only\nafter the issuance of the post-dated cheque), a complaint under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_122\">Section 138</a>\nNI Act would not lie?</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_55\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"77590271\" id=\"span_80\">25.    In my view, it would defeat the object of <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_123\">Section 138</a> NI Act to hold\nthat the seller/ service provider cannot enforce his right conferred by\n<a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_124\">Section 138</a> NI Act in such a situation, as it would encourage dishonest\nbuyers to evade their penal liability.    It would erode the efficacy and\ncredibility of commercial transactions undertaken on the basis of post-dated\ncheques, or cheques issued towards advance payment, with a credit period.\nThe view of the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/77590271/\" id=\"a_125\">Indus Airways</a> (supra) does not appear to\ntake out from the scope of <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_126\">Section 138</a> NI Act cases of this nature, as what\nfell for examination was a fact situation where the advance cheque had been\nissued along with the purchase order, and the supply of goods was not made\nfor whatever reason.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_56\">26.    The Explanation to <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_127\">Section 138</a> NI Act reads:\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_81\">Crl. L.P. 558/2014                                                Page 24 of 31</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">        &quot;Explanation -For the purposes of this section, &quot;debt or other\n       liability&quot; means a legally enforceable debt or other liability.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_57\">27.    Thus, the &quot;debt or other liability&quot; has to be a legally enforceable debt\nor other liability.   Neither the main provision of <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_128\">Section 138</a>, nor the\nexplanation suggest that the debt or other liability should be in existence on\nthe date of issuance of the cheque, i.e. on the date of its delivery to the\ndrawee or someone on his behalf or, on the date that the cheque bears. The\nonly reference to time in the Section, is the point of time when the cheque is\nreturned unpaid by the drawers bank.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_58\">28.    In my view, therefore, the scope of <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_129\">Section 138</a> NI Act would cover\ncases where the ascertained and crystallised debt or other liability exists on\nthe date that the cheque is presented, and not only to case where the debt or\nother liability exists on the date on which it was delivered to the seller as a\npost-dated cheque, or as a current cheque with credit period. The liability,\nthough, should be in relation to the transaction in respect whereof the\ncheque is given, and cannot relate to some other independent liability. If,\non the date that the cheque is presented, the ascertained and crystallised debt\nor other liability relatable to the dishonoured cheque exists, the dishonor of\nthe cheque would invite action under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_130\">Section 138</a> NI Act. There could be\nsituations where, for example, an issue may be raised with regard to the\nquality, quantity, deficiency, specifications, etc. of the goods/services\nsupplied, or accounting. It would have to be examined on a case to case\nbasis, whether an ascertained or crystallised debt or other liability exists,\nwhich could be enforced by resort to <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_131\">Section 138</a> NI Act, or not.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_82\">Crl. L.P. 558/2014                                                 Page 25 of 31</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_59\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"533881\" id=\"span_83\">29.    The decision in Collage Culture (supra) is premised entirely on the\ndecision of the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/533881/\" id=\"a_132\">M.S. Narayana Menon</a> (supra).</span>               <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1623811\" id=\"span_84\">It\nappears that the decision in <a href=\"/doc/1623811/\" id=\"a_133\">Beena Shabeer</a> (supra) was not cited before the\nCourt. In the light of the aforesaid discussion, I am of the view that this\ndecision does not come to the aid of the accused.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_60\">30.    Thus, I am of the considered view that there is no merit in the legal\nsubmission of the respondent accused that only on account of the fact that\nthe cheque in question was issued as security in respect of a contingent\nliability, the complaint under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_134\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act would not be\nmaintainable. At the same time, I may add that it would need examination\non a case to case basis as to whether, on the date of presentation of the\ndishonoured cheque the ascertained and crystallised debt or other liability\ndid not exist.       The onus to raise a probable defence would lie on the\naccused, as the law raises a presumption in favour of the holder of the\ncheque that the dishonoured cheque was issued in respect of a debt or other\nliability. As settled by the Supreme Court, the said onus obliges the accused\nto raise a defence - either by picking holes in the case of the complainant\nand/ or by positively leading defence evidence which leads the Court to\nbelieve that there is a probable defence raised by the accused to the claim of\nthe complainant with regard to the existence of the debt or other liability.\nThe said onus does not cast as stringent an obligation on the accused, as it\ncasts on the complainant, who has to prove beyond reasonable doubt the\nguilt of the accused.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_61\">31.    Therefore, I now turn to the facts of the present case to examine as to\nwhether, or not, the accused has been able to raise a probable defence to cast\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_85\">Crl. L.P. 558/2014                                                Page 26 of 31</span>\n a doubt on the claim made by the complainant with regard to the existence\nof an ascertained and crystallised debt or other liability in relation to the\ntransactions in respect whereof the cheque in question had been issued as\nsecurity.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_62\">32.    The complainant has produced the daily sauda confirmation (Ex.\nCW1/10 to 15) and the cash difference bills (Ex. CW-1/16) in respect of the\nshare transactions recorded in Ex.CW-1/10 to Ex.CW-1/15, on record to\nsubstantiate its claim. The cash difference bills (Ex. CW-1/16) are for the\nperiod of 02.07.1996 to 16.07.1996. CW-1, Dilip Kumar Aggarwal in his\nexamination-in-chief stated that &quot;He allowed the transaction on line and\ndetail of the transaction are Exhibited Ex CW1/10 to Ex CW1/15 and the\ndifference bills are collectly Exhibited Ex CW1/16 (Page 17 to 37)&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_63\">33.    CW-1 Dilip Kumar Agarwal also exhibited the letter dated\n24.07.1996 of the accused as Ex. CW-1/17 along with which the accused\ntendered a cheque of     Rs.50,000/- bearing no.412933 dated 24.07.1996\ndrawn on its Bank. In this letter, he inter alia, stated &quot;I am giving this\ncheque towards my liabilities&quot;. Pertinently, accused no.2 did not deny his\nsignatures on the said letter. He only claimed that the said document was\nsigned in blank and given as such to the complainant. This defence of the\naccused would be tested a little later. The aggregate of cash difference bills\n(Ex. CW-1/16) which consist of 21 pages, purports to project the liability of\nthe accused as on 24.07.1996 to the tune of Rs. 14,42,789.50.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_64\">34.    I may now turn to examine the defence of the accused. The accused\nproduced DW-2 Satish Kumar Chugh as its prime witness. In his statement\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_86\">Crl. L.P. 558/2014                                                Page 27 of 31</span>\n recorded under Section 313 Cr PC, the accused DW-2 admitted his\nsignatures on the cheque. He also admitted that he had filled the payee and\nthe date himself. However, he denied having filled the amount. He stated\nthat the rest of the particulars were not filled by him. He also admitted to\nhave given the cheque to the complainant. He denied the transactions\nrecorded in Ex CW-1/10 to CW-1/15. He claimed that the complainant was\ndealing with the said shares on its own. He claimed that he had given order\nto the complainant to purchase only 700 shares, i.e. 500 shares of English\nIndian Clays Limited and 200 shares of State Bank of India. He stated that\nhe had no concern with the difference bills Ex. CW-1/16. He stated that the\ncheque in question was without any legally enforceable liability. In his\nexamination in chief, DW-2 stated that the complainant Credential Leasing\n&amp; Credits Limited took the signatures on certain blank papers and told him\nthat the same were required as some formality with SEBI for making him as\ntheir sub-broker. He further deposed that Shruti Investments is in HUF\nbusiness of which he is a Karta and that Shruti Investments was dealing\nonly in secondary market of shares. He stated that Shruti Investement was\ndoing its business of sale and purchase of shares through two or three\nbrokers. DW-2 further deposed that:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">       &quot;It is correct that for becoming a sub-broker with a member of\n       National Stock Exchange, a margin money has to be deposited.\n       The said margin money has to be deposited by the interested\n       person who wants to become sub-broker to the member of\n       National Stock Exchange. No other security is required except\n       the margin money for the purpose of becoming a sub-broker\n       with the member of NSE. Margin money is kept by the member\n       of NSE to secure himself from the fluctuation in the share\n       prices. I did not pay any margin money to complainant\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_87\">Crl. L.P. 558/2014                                              Page 28 of 31</span>\n        company when I did formalities regarding the sub-brokership\n       with the complainant company&quot;.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_65\">35.    The defence set up by the respondent/accused that accused no.2 had\ngiven blank signed papers to the appellant/complainant is unbelievable.\nFirstly, there is no contemporaneous record produced by the accused to\nshow that the accused had delivered blank signed papers to the complainant\nfor any purpose, much less for the purpose of becoming a sub-broker of the\ncomplainant. Secondly, a perusal of Ex. CW-1/10, 1/11, 1/13, 1/15 and\n1/17 shows that the signatures of accused no.2 on the said documents are so\npositioned and placed as to rule out the possibility of the said documents\nbeing filled in later. Ex. CW-1/10, 1/11, 1/12, 1/13 and 1/15 are the daily\nsauda confirmation on a printed format. The signatures appear outside the\nprinted area and are so placed as to suggest that they have been consciously\nengrossed on these documents close to the printed area. Ex. CW-1/17 is a\nhand written communication, and there is nothing to suggest that the writing\nin the said document is different from the signatures of DW-2, which he has\nadmitted.    Pertinently, Ex. CW-1/17 records that the accused issued a\ncheque of Rs.50,000/- towards his liabilities. The said letters along with the\ncheque were issued on the 24.07.1996, i.e. the same day on which the last of\nthe cash difference bills were prepared. The cash difference bills, as noticed\nherein above, are premised on the daily sauda confirmation acknowledged\nby the accused.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_66\">36.    While claiming that the complainant took his signatures on certain\nblank papers and &quot;told me that the same were required as some formality\nwith SEBI for making me as sub-broker&quot;, the accused does not even disclose\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_88\">Crl. L.P. 558/2014                                                Page 29 of 31</span>\n as to who in the organisation of the complainant had held out such a\nrepresentation to him. While he admits that to become a sub-broker of a\nmember of the NSE margin money has to be deposited to secure the\nbroker/member of NSE, DW-2 states that he did not give any margin money\nto the appellant member of NSE to become a sub-broker. It is not explained\nby DW-2, as to why such a preferential treatment was meted out to the\nrespondents by the appellant, and why the appellant exposed itself to such a\nrisk qua the respondents share transactions. This information was within\nthe personal knowledge of DW-2, and his failure to disclose the same raises\nan adverse inference against the accused. The defence of the accused is\nmerely an ipsi dixi of the accused and appears to be too farfetched and\nsham. It cannot be construed as a probable defence. A defence would be\nconsidered to be probable if it appeals to the Court as probable and\nreasonable keeping in mind the natural course of conduct of a prudent\nhuman being of reasonable intelligence. Thus, the debt/other liability of the\naccused to the tune of Rs.14.42 lacs stood ascertained, crystallised and\nestablished from Ex. CW-1/16 - being the cash difference bills as on\n24.07.1996. The cheque in question when presented was in respect of a\ncrystallised outstanding debt owed by the accused.        Consequently, its\ndishonour coupled with the non payment of the cheque amount despite\nstatutory notice led to the commission of the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_135\">Section 138</a> of\nthe NI Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_67\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1623811\" id=\"span_89\">37.
