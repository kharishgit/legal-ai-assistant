By the same judgment and order, the appeal \nfiled by the appellant challenging his conviction under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 498-A</a> \nIPC and the sentence of two years RI and a fine of Rs.1,000/- and in \ndefault to undergo RI for three months was dismissed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">2.\tThe case of the prosecution, in brief, is that the deceased Revata \n@ Tai daughter of Dattarao resident of village Umatwadi was married \nto the appellant Trimukh Maroti Kirkan (for short &#x27;Trimukh&#x27;) nearly \nseven years before the incident which took place on 4.11.1996 in \nvillage Kikki.  Maroti Kamaji Kirkan (for short &#x27;Maroti&#x27;) is the father \nand Nilawatibai Maroti Kirkan (for short &#x27;Nilawati&#x27;) is the mother of \nthe appellant Trimukh and they are residents of village Kikki.   The \nappellant who is the husband and Maroti and Nilawati used to ill-treat \nthe deceased Revata and used to harass her on account of non-\npayment of Rs.25,000/- by her parents for the purpose of purchasing a \ntempo for the appellant.   Whenever, the deceased Revata came to her \nparental home, she used to disclose to her family members the ill-\ntreatment and harassment meted out to her.   She came to her parental \nhome at the time of Panchami festival in the year 1996 and stayed \nthere for about 15 days.   During this period also she disclosed that on \naccount of non-fulfilment of demand of Rs.25,000/- by her father, the \nappellant and her in-laws (Maroti and Nilawati) used to harass her.  \nShe was often beaten and was not provided food.   After the Panchami \nfestival, the father of Revata took her to the appellant&#x27;s house in \nvillage Kikki and requested the appellant and her in-laws not to ill-\ntreat her.  He, however, told them that he is not in a position to fulfil \ntheir demand of Rs.25,000/- on account of his weak financial \ncondition.   A few months thereafter, Dattarao received information \nfrom a person of village Kikki that Revata had died due to snake bite.  \nInformation was also given by the Police Patil of the village to P.S. \nNanded (Rural) that Revata had died due to snake bite and on the \nbasis of this information, a case as A.D. No.42 of 1996 was registered \nin accordance with <a href=\"/doc/411677/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 174</a> Cr.P.C. at the police station.  \nDevichand, ASI and some police personnel went to the village, held \ninquest over the dead body and after preparing the spot panchnama \nsent the same for post-mortem examination.  The appellant Trimukh \nhimself showed the place of incident where the victim had been \nallegedly bitten by snake and had died.  The post-mortem examination \nconducted on the body of Revata disclosed that she had died due to \nasphyxia as a result of compression of neck.   Dattarao, father of the \ndeceased then lodged an FIR of the incident at 4.30 p.m. on 5.11.1990 \nat the police station and a case was then registered under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 302</a> \nIPC.   During the course of investigation, the police recorded \nstatements of some witnesses.   The appellant was arrested and while \nin custody he made a disclosure statement on the basis of which some \nrecoveries were made.  After completion of investigation, chargesheet \nwas submitted against three persons, viz., the appellant Trimukh and \nhis parents, viz., Maroti and Nilawati.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">3.\tThe  learned Sessions Judge, Nanded framed charges under \n<a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 498-A</a> IPC against all the three accused and also under \n<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 302</a> IPC against appellant Trimukh.   The accused pleaded not \nguilty and claimed to be tried.   In order to establish its case the \nprosecution examined 14 witnesses and filed some documentary \nevidence.  The accused in their statement denied the prosecution case \nand stated that Revata had died on account of snake bite.  The learned \nSessions Judge convicted all the three accused under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 498-A</a> \nread with <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 34</a> IPC and sentenced them to two years RI and a \nfine of Rs.1,000/- and in default to undergo RI for three months.  The \nappellant was, however, acquitted of the charge under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 302</a> \nIPC.   All the three accused preferred Criminal Appeal No.158 of \n1997 before the High Court challenging their conviction and sentence \nunder <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 498-A</a> IPC read with <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 34</a> IPC while the State of \nMaharahstra preferred Criminal Appeal No.220 of 1997 challenging \nthe acquittal of Trimukh under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 302</a> IPC.   The High Court \nallowed the appeal preferred by Maroti and Nilawati accused and their \nconviction under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 498-A</a> IPC was set aside and the appeal \npreferred by the appellant was dismissed.   The appeal preferred by \nthe State of Maharashtra was allowed and the appellant was convicted \nunder <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 302</a> IPC and was sentenced to imprisonment for life \nand a fine of Rs.2,000/- and in default to further undergo six months \nRI.  Both the sentences were ordered to run concurrently.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_5\">4.\tSince the present appeal has been filed under Section 2(a) of the \nSupreme Court (Enlargement of Criminal Appellate Jurisdiction) Act, \n1970 and the High Court has reversed the order of acquittal and has \nconvicted the appellant under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 302</a> IPC, it will be appropriate \nto briefly consider the evidence on record.  PW1. Dattarao is the \nfather and PW.2 Rukmabai is the mother of the deceased Revata and \nthey are residents of village Umatwadi.  Both of them have deposed \nthat the marriage of the deceased with the appellant took place nearly \n7 years back in which they had given Rs.20,000/- in cash besides \nclothes and utensils.  Whenever deceased came to her parental home, \nshe used to complain that she was being harassed and ill-treated on \naccount of demand of money.  They have further deposed that last \ntime the deceased came to their house on the occasion of Panchami \nfestival when she told them that the appellant wanted to purchase a \ntempo and, therefore, her in-laws and also the appellant were asking \nher to get Rs.25,000/- from her parents.   The deceased also informed \nthat occasionally she was not provided food and was beaten on \naccount of non-fulfillment of the demand of Rs.25,000/-.   They have \nfurther deposed that the deceased stayed with them for about 15 days \nand thereafter PW.1 Dattarao escorted her to her matrimonial home \nand informed her in-laws that he was not in a position to give \nRs.25,000/- and further requested them not to ill-treat her.  A few days \nbefore the Diwali festival a person came from village Kikki and \ninformed that Revata had died on account of snake bite.   Thereafter, \nPW.1, PW.2 and their sons and two daughters-in-law went to village \nKikki which is about 25 kilometers from their village Umatwadi.  On \nreaching there they saw that the body of Revata had been placed in a \nsitting posture with her back resting on the wall and a strip of cloth \nhad been tied along her mouth.   PW.1 has further deposed that \nsubsequently he lodged an FIR on 5.11.1996 at the police station.  \nThough a suggestion was given to both the witnesses that the marriage \nof the deceased had taken place about 10 years back, but both of them \nspecifically denied and stated that the marriage had taken place 5-6 \nyears back.   PW.1 has further deposed that he removed the cloth \nwhich was tied along the mouth of the deceased and noticed marks of \ninjury around the neck and cheek and there were no bangles on her \nhands. PW.3 Balasaheb, who is cousin of PW.1 and is resident of \nvillage Umatwadi, has deposed that whenever Revata came to her \nparental home, she always came to his house as well.   She used to \nnarrate about the ill-treatment meted out to her by the appellant and \nher in-laws as they were demanding an amount of Rs.25,000/- for \npurchasing a tempo for the appellant.  He has further deposed that in \nthe evening of 4.11.1996 two persons from village Kikki came to his \nvillage and informed PW.1 and others that Revata had died on account \nof snake bite.   The witness has further deposed that next day in the \nmorning he went to village Kikki along with several other persons of \nhis village and saw the body of the deceased.  There were injury \nmarks around the neck, cheek, hand and other parts of the body.   \nPW.4 Chander is another cousin of PW.1 and is resident of the same \nvillage Umatwadi.   His statement is almost similar to that of PW.3 \nBalasaheb.  PW.5 Girjabai is a resident of village Kikki and her house \nis very close to the house of the accused in the same village.   She has \ndeposed that the deceased Revata used to visit her and she had often \ntold her that on account of non-fulfilment of demand of money by her \nparents, she was being ill-treated by her in-laws and husband \n(appellant).   She has further deposed that she used to console the \ndeceased and tell her that the ill-treatment being meted out to her \nwould gradually stop.  She has further stated that at about 3-3.15 p.m. \non the date of the incident she was informed that Maroti&#x27;s daughter-\nin-law had died due to snake bite.  She immediately rushed to the \nhouse of Maroti and saw the body of the deceased.   There were marks \nof injury on the neck and cheek and there were no bangles on her \nhands. This witness is no doubt distantly related to the deceased as her \nhusband&#x27;s mother is sister of PW.2 but nothing material has come out \nin her cross-examination which may discredit her testimony regarding \nthe demand of Rs.25,000/- by the appellant and his parents and also \nthe ill-treatment being meted out to the deceased.   It was suggested to \nher in her cross-examination that the deceased was suffering from \nT.B. and asthma and also that she used to have occasional chest pain \nbut it was emphatically denied by her.   \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\">5.\tPW.8 Madhvrao is the real brother of accused Maroti and the \nappellant is his nephew.   In his examination-in-chief he stated that he \ndid not know how Revata had died and he had not witnessed any \nincident. The witness was declared as hostile and in his cross-\nexamination by State counsel he admitted that the appellant Trimukh \nused to ply a tempo. PW.6 Maroti son of Ramrao Telange and PW.7 \nVenkat, both residents of village Kikki, have deposed that while in the \ncustody of the police the appellant said that he would show the spot \nwhere the incident had taken place.  Thereafter he had taken the police \nparty and the witnesses to the field of his father Maroti and on his \npointing out a pair of ladies chappal, broken pieces of bangles and a \nsickle lying there were recovered and the appellant had further said \nthat the ladies chappal belonged to his wife.  The aforesaid articles \nwere taken into possession by the Police Inspector and a panchnama \nwas prepared which was signed by them.   PW.7 has further deposed \nthat on the pointing out of the appellant his shoe was recovered which \nwas taken in possession by the police and panchnama was drawn on \nwhich he has put his signature.  PW.9 Digamber who was a witness of \ninquest turned hostile, but in his cross-examination he stated that he \nwent to the house of accused Maroti at about 9.00 a.m. and had seen \nthe body of the deceased with a piece of cloth tied around her mouth.  \nHe further admitted that when the police was recording the \npanchnama, he had said that there was no mark of snake bite on the \nbody of the deceased and that he had put his signature on the inquest \npanchnama.   PW.11 Vilas and PW.12 Nilawati whose agricultural \nland is situate near the agricultural land of Maroti accused turned \nhostile.  PW.13 Digamber son of Madhavrao who is also a resident of \nvillage Kikki, also turned hostile.  However, he admitted that he had \nheard that Revata had died due to snake bite and further that a tempo \nis owned by Maroti which is plied by the appellant Trimukh.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_7\">6.\tPW.14 Devichand, Assistant Sub Inspector of Police, P.S. \nNanded (Rural) has deposed that on the basis of the information given \nby the Police Patil, an Accidental Death Case was registered at 12.30 \np.m. on 5.11.1996 at the police station and he was entrusted with the \ninquiry of the same.  He came to the village Kikki, held inquest on the \nbody of the deceased and sent the same for post-mortem examination.  \nHe had prepared the panchnama which was signed by the witnesses.   \nAfter the report of the post-mortem examination had been received \nand the FIR had been lodged by PW.1 Dattarao at 4.30 p.m. on \n5.1.1996, a case was registered under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 302</a> IPC.  He had \narrested the appellant and while he was in custody some recoveries \nwere made regarding which a panchnama was prepared and was \nsigned by the witnesses.   He has further deposed that he asked the \nappellant Trimukh as to how the incident took place and then he had \nshown the scene of offence in a field and on his pointing out he had \nrecovered a pair of ladies chappal, pieces of bangles and a sickle from \nthe spot.   In his cross-examination PW.14 has stated that when he had \nreached the hose of accused Maroti in village Kikki after registration \nof an Accidental Death Case, he had found the body of the deceased \ninside a room in a sitting posture with her back taking support from \nthe wall. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\">7.\tPW.10 Dr. Hanumant Vasantrao Godbole conducted post-\nmortem examination on the body of the deceased Revata between \n2.00 p.m. to 2.30 p.m. on 5.11.1996 and found the following ante \nmortem injuries on her person :-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">1.\tSwelling of left cheek seen (contusion).

Thyroid \ncartilage and trachea showed reddish patches of \nhaemorrhage externally and on opening. \t\t\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_18\">\tThe witness has opined that the death was caused due to  \nasphyxia as a result of compression of neck.  He deposed that the \ngeneral and specific chemical testing did not reveal any poison and \nhad there been a snake bite then poison would have appeared in the \nblood.  He further deposed that the injuries present on the neck of the \ndeceased could be caused if the throat is pressed with a shoe with \nforce and the victim is pulled at the opposite direction by holding her \nhands.   \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_19\">8.\tThe accused did not examine any witness in their defence.  \nMaroti accused admitted in reply to question no.14 that the dead body \nwas kept resting in sitting position and a strip of cloth was tied to the \nmouth.   \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">9. \tFrom the evidence adduced by the prosecution the following \ncircumstances are clearly established. \n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">I.\tThe marriage of Revata with the appellant Trimukh had taken \nplace about 5-6 years back.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_22\">II.\tThe appellant Trimukh used to ply a tempo.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\">III.\tThere was a demand of Rs.25,000/- by the appellant and his \nparents from the parents of the deceased.  The deceased was \nbeing ill-treated and was occasionally not given food on \naccount of the fact that the demand of money had not been met.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_24\">IV.\tThe deceased had told her parents about the fact that she was \nbeing ill-treated and occasionally she was not given food, \nwhenever she visited her parental home and last time on the \noccasion of Panchami festival.  She had also told about the said \nfact to her neighbour PW.5 Girjabai of village Kikki.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_25\">V.\tAfter the death of Revata the appellant and his parents informed \nsome persons in the village as also the family members of the \ndeceased that she had died on account of snake bite.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\">VI.\tWhen PW.1, PW.2, PW.3 and PW.4 reached the house of the \naccused in village Kikki, they found the body of the deceased in \na sitting posture with her back taking support from the wall.   \nPW.14 Devichand, Assistant Sub-Inspector of Police also found \nthe body in the same position.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_27\">VII.\tThe post-mortem examination revealed that Revata had died  \ndue to asphyxia as a result of strangulation and not on account \nof snake bite. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">VIII.\tCertain recoveries like chappal of the deceased, broken pieces \nof bangles were made at the pointing out of the appellant.  A \nshoe was also recovered at his pointing out. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_29\">10.\tIn the case in hand there is no eye-witness of the occurrence \nand the case of the prosecution rests on circumstantial evidence.   The \nnormal principle in a case based on circumstantial evidence is that the \ncircumstances from which an inference of guilt is sought to be drawn \nmust be cogently and firmly established; that those circumstances \nshould be of a definite tendency unerringly pointing towards the guilt \nof the accused; that the circumstances taken cumulatively should form \na chain so complete that there is no escape from the conclusion that \nwithin all human probability the crime was committed by the accused \nand they should be incapable of explanation on any hypothesis other \nthan that of the guilt of the accused and inconsistent with his \ninnocence. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_30\">11.\tThe demand for dowry or money from the parents of the bride \nhas shown a phenomenal increase in last few years.  Cases are \nfrequently coming before the Courts, where the husband or in-laws \nhave gone to the extent of killing the bride if the demand is not met.  \nThese crimes are generally committed in complete secrecy inside the \nhouse and it becomes very difficult for the prosecution to lead \nevidence.  No member of the family, even if he is a witness of the \ncrime, would come forward to depose against another family member.   \nThe neighbours, whose evidence may be of some assistance, are \ngenerally reluctant to depose in Court as they want to keep aloof and \ndo not want to antagonize a neighbourhood family.   The parents or \nother family members of the bride being away from the scene of \ncommission of crime are not in a position to give direct evidence \nwhich may inculpate the real accused except regarding the demand of \nmoney or dowry and harassment caused to the bride.   But, it does not \nmean that a crime committed in secrecy or inside the house should go \nunpunished.   \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_31\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1009272\" id=\"span_1\">12.\tIf an offence takes place inside the privacy of a house and in \nsuch circumstances where the assailants have all the opportunity to \nplan and commit the offence at the time and in circumstances of their \nchoice, it will be extremely difficult for the prosecution to lead \nevidence to establish the guilt of the accused if the strict principle of \ncircumstantial evidence, as noticed above, is insisted upon by the \nCourts.  A Judge does not preside over a criminal trial merely to see \nthat no innocent man is punished.  A Judge also presides to see that a \nguilty man does not escape.  Both are public duties. (See Stirland v. \nDirector of Public Prosecution 1944 AC 315 \u0016 quoted with approval \nby Arijit Pasayat, J. in <a href=\"/doc/1009272/\" id=\"a_17\">State of Punjab vs. Karnail Singh</a> (2003) 11 \nSCC 271).  The law does not enjoin a duty on the prosecution to lead \nevidence of such character which is almost impossible to be led or at \nany rate extremely difficult to be led. The duty on the prosecution is to \nlead such evidence which it is capable of leading, having regard to the \nfacts and circumstances of the case.  Here it is necessary to keep in \nmind <a href=\"/doc/697566/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 106</a> of the Evidence Act which says that when any fact \nis especially within the knowledge of any person, the burden of \nproving that fact is upon him.  Illustration (b) appended to this section \nthrows some light on the content and scope of this provision and it \nreads:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">(b)\tA is charged with traveling on a railway without \nticket.  The burden of proving that he had a ticket is on \nhim.&quot; \n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\">\tWhere an offence like murder is committed in secrecy inside a \nhouse, the initial burden to establish the case would undoubtedly be  \nupon the prosecution, but the nature and amount of evidence to be led \nby it to establish the charge cannot be of the same degree as is \nrequired in other cases of circumstantial evidence. The burden would \nbe of a comparatively lighter character.   In view of <a href=\"/doc/697566/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 106</a> of the \nEvidence Act there will be a corresponding burden on the inmates of \nthe house to give a cogent explanation as to how the crime was \ncommitted.   The inmates of the house cannot get away by simply \nkeeping quiet and offering no explanation on the supposed premise \nthat the burden to establish its case lies entirely upon the prosecution \nand there is no duty at all on an accused to offer any explanation.   \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_33\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"827880\" id=\"span_2\">13.\tA somewhat similar question was examined by this Court in \nconnection with Section 167 and 178-A of the Sea Customs Act in \n<a href=\"/doc/827880/\" id=\"a_20\">Collector of Customs, Madras &amp; Ors. v. D. Bhoormull</a> AIR 1974 SC \n859 and it will be apt to reproduce paras 30 to 32 of the reports which \nare as under :</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">30. It cannot be disputed that in proceedings for imposing \npenalties under Clause (8) of <a href=\"/doc/593844/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 167</a> to which \nSection 178-A does not apply, the burden of proving that \nthe goods are smuggled goods, is on the Department. \n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_34\">This is a fundamental rule relating to proof in all criminal \nor quasi-criminal proceedings, where there is no statutory \nprovision to the contrary. But in appreciating its scope \nand the nature of the onus cast by it, we must pay due \nregard to other kindred principles, no less fundamental, \nof universal application. One of them is that the \nprosecution or the Department is not required to prove its \ncase with mathematical precision to a demonstrable \ndegree; for, in all human affairs absolute certainty is a \nmyth, and as Prof. Brett felicitously puts it - &#x27;&#x27;all \nexactness is a fake&quot;. El Dorado of absolute proof being \nunattainable, the law, accepts for it, probability as a \nworking substitute in this work-a-day world. The law \ndoes not require the prosecution to prove the impossible. \nAll that it requires is the establishment of such a degree \nof probability that a prudent man may, on its basis, \nbelieve in the existence of the fact in issue. Thus, legal \nproof is not necessarily perfect proof; often it is nothing \nmore than a prudent man&#x27;s estimate as to the probabilities \nof the case.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_35\">31.  The other cardinal principle having an important \nbearing on the incidence of burden of proof is that \nsufficiency and weight of the evidence is to be \nconsidered - to use the words of Lord Mansfield in \nBlatch v. Archer (1774) 1 Cowp. 63 at p.65 &quot;according to \nthe proof which it was in the power of one side to prove, \nand in the power of the other to have contradicted&quot;. Since \nit is exceedingly difficult, if not absolutely impossible for \nthe prosecution to prove facts which are especially within \nthe knowledge of the opponent or the accused, it is not \nobliged to prove them as part of its primary burden.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_36\">32.  Smuggling is clandestine conveying of goods to \navoid legal duties. Secrecy and stealth being its covering \nguards, it is impossible for the Preventive Department to \nunravel every link of the process. Many facts relating to \nthis illicit business remain in the special or peculiar \nknowledge of the person concerned in it. On the principle \nunderlying <a href=\"/doc/697566/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 106</a>, Evidence Act, the burden to \nestablish those facts is cast on the person concerned; and \nif he falls to establish or explain those facts, an adverse \ninference of facts may arise against him, which coupled \nwith the presumptive evidence adduced by the \nprosecution or the Department would rebut the initial \npresumption of innocence in favour of that person, and in \nthe result prove him guilty. As pointed out by Best in \n&#x27;Law of Evidence&#x27;, (12th Edn. <a href=\"/doc/1723820/\" id=\"a_23\">Article 320</a>, page 291), the \n&quot;presumption of innocence is, no doubt, presumptio juris; \nbut every day&#x27;s practice shows that it may be successfully \nencountered by the presumption of guilt arising from the \nrecent (unexplained) possession of stolen property&quot;, \nthough the latter is only a presumption of fact. Thus the \nburden on the prosecution or the Department may be \nconsiderably lightened even by such presumption of fact \narising in their favour. However, this does not mean that \nthe special or peculiar knowledge of the person \nproceeded against will relieve the prosecution or the \nDepartment altogether of the burden of producing some \nevidence in respect of that fact in issue.  It will only \nalleviate that burden to discharge which very slight \nevidence may suffice.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"8165\" id=\"span_3\">(Emphasis supplied)\n\tThe aforesaid principle has been approved and followed in \n<a href=\"/doc/8165/\" id=\"a_24\">Balram Prasad Agrawal v. State of Bihar &amp; Ors.</a> AIR 1997 SC 1830 \nwhere a married woman had committed suicide on account of ill-\ntreatment meted out to her by her husband and in-laws on account of \ndemand of dowry and being issueless.</span>  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"575647\" id=\"span_4\">14.\tThe question of burden of proof where some facts are within \nthe personal knowledge of the accused was examined in <a href=\"/doc/575647/\" id=\"a_25\">State of West \nBengal v. Mir Mohammad Omar &amp; Ors.</a> (2000) 8 SCC 382.   In this \ncase the assailants forcibly dragged the deceased Mahesh from the \nhouse where he was taking shelter on account of the fear of the \naccused and took him away at about 2.30 in the night.  Next day in the \nmorning his mangled body was found lying in the hospital.   The trial \nCourt convicted the accused under Section 364 read with <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 34</a> \nIPC and sentenced them to 10 years RI.  The accused preferred an \nappeal against their conviction before the High Court and the State \nalso filed an appeal challenging the acquittal of the accused for \nmurder charge.  The accused had not given any explanation as to what \nhappened to Mahesh after he was abducted by them.  The learned \nSessions Judge after referring to the law on circumstantial evidence \nhad observed that there was a missing link in the chain of evidence \nafter the deceased was last seen together with the accused persons and \nthe discovery of the dead body in the hospital and had concluded that \nthe prosecution had failed to establish the charge of murder against \nthe accused persons beyond any reasonable doubt.  This Court took \nnote of the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/697566/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 106</a> of the Evidence Act and laid \ndown the following principle in paras 31 to 34 of the reports :</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">&quot;31.   The pristine rule that the burden of proof is on the \nprosecution to prove the guilt of the accused should not \nbe taken as a fossilised doctrine as though it admits no \nprocess of intelligent reasoning. The doctrine of \npresumption is not alien to the above rule, nor would it \nimpair the temper of the rule. On the other hand, if the \ntraditional rule relating to burden of proof of the \nprosecution is allowed to be wrapped in pedantic \ncoverage, the offenders in serious offences would be the \nmajor beneficiaries and the society would be the casualty.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">32.  In this case, when the prosecution succeeded in \nestablishing the afore-narrated circumstances, the court \nhas to presume the existence of certain facts. \nPresumption is a course recognised by the law for the \ncourt to rely on in conditions such as this.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">33.  Presumption of fact is an inference as to the \nexistence of one fact from the existence of some other \nfacts, unless the truth of such inference is disproved. \nPresumption of fact is a rule in law of evidence that a fact \notherwise doubtful may be inferred from certain other \nproved facts. When inferring the existence of a fact from \nother set of proved facts, the court exercises a process of \nreasoning and reaches a logical conclusion as the most \nprobable position. The above principle has gained \nlegislative recognition in India when <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 114</a> is \nincorporated in the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_29\">Evidence Act</a>. It empowers the court \nto presume the existence of any fact which it thinks likely \nto have happened. In that process the court shall have \nregard to the common course of natural events, human \nconduct etc. in relation to the facts of the case.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">34.   When it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that \nMahesh was abducted by the accused and they took him \nout of that area, the accused alone knew what happened \nto him until he was with them. If he was found murdered \nwithin a short time after the abduction the permitted \nreasoning process would enable the court to draw the \npresumption that the accused have murdered him. Such \ninference can be disrupted if the accused would tell the \ncourt what else happened to Mahesh at least until he was \nin their custody.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_39\">\tApplying the aforesaid principle, this Court while maintaining \nthe conviction under Section 364 read with <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 34</a> IPC reversed \nthe order of acquittal under Section 302 read with <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 34</a> IPC and \nconvicted the accused under the said provision and sentenced them to \nimprisonment for life. \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\">15.\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1750636\" id=\"span_5\">In <a href=\"/doc/1750636/\" id=\"a_32\">Ram Gulam Chaudhary &amp; Ors. v.

The \naccused, however, offered no explanation as to what they did after \nthey took away the boy. It was held that for the absence of any \nexplanation from the side of the accused about the boy, there was \nevery justification for drawing an inference that they have murdered \nthe boy.   It was further observed that even though <a href=\"/doc/697566/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 106</a> of the \nEvidence Act may not be intended to relieve the prosecution of its  \nburden to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt, but \nthe section would apply to cases like the present, where the \nprosecution has succeeded in proving facts from which a reasonable \ninference can be drawn regarding death.

The principle is that when an incriminating \ncircumstance is put to the accused and the said accused either offers \nno explanation or offers an explanation which is found to be untrue, \nthen the same becomes an additional link in the chain of \ncircumstances to make it complete.

The appellant was plying a \ntempo in order to earn his livelihood.  It is fully established that the \ndeceased Revata was being ill-treated and harassed on account of non-\nfulfilment of demand of Rs.25,000/- which the appellant wanted for \npurchasing a tempo.   The deceased Revata was often beaten and was \nsometimes not given food.  After Revata had been murdered, \ninformation was sent to her parents that she had died on account of \nsnake bite, which was reiterated when they reached the house of the \nappellant in village Kikki. In fact, everyone in the village had been \ntold that Revata had died on account of snake bite and the Police Patil, \nbelieving the said information to be true, had lodged an Accidental \nDeath Report at the police station.   The medical evidence, however, \nshowed that she had  died on account of asphyxia due to strangulation.  \nThe body of the deceased was purposely placed in a sitting posture \nwith her back taking support of the wall so that no one may suspect \nthat she had actually been killed as a result of strangulation and may \nbelieve the version of snake bite given by the appellant and his \nparents.   The appellant in his statement under <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C. did \nnot offer any explanation as to how she received the injuries which \nwere found on her body.  Recovery of some articles of the deceased \nwas made at the pointing out of the appellant. The circumstances \nenumerated above unerringly point to the guilt of the accused and they \nare inconsistent with his innocence.   \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_44\">19.\tThe High Court was, therefore, perfectly right in allowing the \nappeal filed by the State and in convicting the appellant under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_45\">Section \n302</a> IPC and sentencing him thereunder. We, therefore, do not find \nany merit in the appeal, which is hereby dismissed. \n</p>",
