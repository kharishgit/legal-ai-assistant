She also complained that she\n\n    was not provided with clothes and shoes to wear and whenever she\n\n    asked        her husband for such things, he did not behave properly.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">    Complainant further reported to the police that petitioner repeatedly\n\n    teased her that she had not brought any money at the time of her\n\n\n\n\n    marriage and she replied that since her parents are poor, she was not\n\n\n\n\n\n    able to give them anything. Complainant further reported that\n\n    whenever, accused accompanied her to her parents&#x27; house in village\n\n\n\n\n\n    Dhali Dibber, Tehsil Rajgarh, he did not stay with her, rather visited\n\n    other ladies in the village. She further alleged that with the passage of\n\n    time, petitioner started proclaiming that he would not keep her at his\n\n    house. His beatings increased with the passage of time. Finally, after\n\n    becoming totally helpless, she narrated entire facts to her parents and\n\n    sister, who repeatedly counseled petitioner to behave properly with the\n\n    complainant but to no avail. Complainant specifically complained that\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                               ::: Downloaded on - 18/04/2017 00:09:21 :::HCHP</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                       -3-</span>\n\n\n\n\n    her mother-in-law, father-in-law and sister-in-law, also misbehaved\n\n    with her and she was not provided meals etc. As per complainant, she\n\n\n\n\n                                                               .\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">    became pregnant but despite that petitioner kept on committing\n\n\n\n\n\n    atrocities upon her and finally in August, 2004, she with her two\n\n    months old pregnancy, was left in the house of her parents, by the\n\n\n\n\n\n    mother-in-law, Smt. Kaulan Devi. Complainant while lodging report on\n\n    9.4.2015, also proclaimed that she was pregnant for the last nine\n\n\n\n\n\n    months and during this period, nobody from her in-laws bothered to\n\n    maintain her and as such sought action against her in-laws including\n\n    her husband, in terms of <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 498A</a> IPC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">          3.    Subsequently, on the basis of investigation carried out by\n\n    the police, pursuant to registration of FIR, as referred above, and on\n\n\n    the conclusion thereof, police presented challan in the competent court\n\n    of law. Learned trial Court being satisfied that prima facie case exists\n\n\n\n\n    against petitioner, proceeded to frame charge under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 498A</a> IPC\n\n\n\n\n\n    against the petitioner as well as other family members of the petitioner,\n\n    to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.

However, the fact remains\n\n    that the learned trial Court below, on the basis of material adduced on\n\n    record by the prosecution held petitioner guilty of having committed\n\n    offence punishable under Section 498A IPC and acquitted other co-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">    accused.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                            ::: Downloaded on - 18/04/2017 00:09:21 :::HCHP</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                       -4-</span>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">          4.    Being aggrieved with the aforesaid judgment passed by\n\n    learned trial Court, petitioner preferred an appeal before the learned\n\n\n\n\n                                                               .\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">    Sessions Judge, Sirmaur at Nahan, who also dismissed the same while\n\n\n\n\n\n    upholding the judgment of conviction passed by learned trial Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">    Hence, this petition by the petitioner praying therein for his acquittal\n\n\n\n\n\n    after setting aside judgments of conviction passed by the learned\n\n    Courts below.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_14\">          5.    Mr. Vinay Thakur, learned counsel representing the\n\n    petitioner, vehemently argued that impugned judgments of conviction\n\n    recorded by the Courts below are not sustainable as the same are not\n\n    based upon correct appreciation of evidence adduced on record by the\n\n    respective parties, hence deserve to be set aside. Mr. Thakur, while\n\n\n    inviting attention of this Court to the impugned judgments passed by\n\n    the learned Courts below, strenuously argued that bare perusal of\n\n\n\n\n    same suggests that the courts below have not appreciated evidence in\n\n\n\n\n\n    its right perspective, as a result of which, erroneous findings have come\n\n    on record to the detriment of the petitioner, who is an innocent person.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_15\">    Mr. Vinay Thakur specifically invited attention of this Court to <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_5\">Section\n\n    498A</a> IPC, to state that cruelty, if any, was required to be proved by the\n\n    prosecution within the ambit of explanation as provided to <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_6\">Section\n\n    498A</a> IPC, but in the instant case, bare perusal of evidence available on\n\n    record nowhere suggests that prosecution was able to prove beyond\n\n    reasonable doubt that cruelty, if any, was meted out to the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                            ::: Downloaded on - 18/04/2017 00:09:21 :::HCHP</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                       -5-</span>\n\n\n\n\n    complainant by the petitioner, as defined under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 498A</a> IPC, and,\n\n    as such, no conviction, if any, could be recoded by the learned Courts\n\n\n\n\n                                                               .\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_16\">    below. Mr. Thakur, while advancing arguments fairly conceded that\n\n\n\n\n\n    though defence was taken by the petitioner that complainant was not\n\n    his legally wedded wife, but it stands duly proved on record that\n\n\n\n\n\n    complainant is/was legally wedded wife of the petitioner and as such\n\n    that aspect of the matter need not be looked into by this Court.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_17\">          6.    While concluding his arguments, Mr. Thakur made this\n\n    Court to travel through the evidence adduced on record by the\n\n    prosecution to demonstrate that there is no iota of evidence suggestive\n\n    of the fact that complainant was maltreated and dowry, if any, was ever\n\n    demanded, which could compel her to cause grave injury or danger to\n\n\n    her life. Mr. Vinay Thakur, also contended that approach adopted by\n\n    the learned Courts below also can not be accepted because, on the\n\n\n\n\n    same set of evidence, other co-accused have been acquitted whereas,\n\n\n\n\n\n    petitioner has been held guilty of having committed offence punishable\n\n    under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 498A</a> IPC, as such judgments passed by learned Courts\n\n\n\n\n\n    below deserve to be set aside. Mr. Vinay Thakur, also stated that both\n\n    the learned Courts below failed to take note of the fact that as per own\n\n    statement of the complainant, she had left house of petitioner in the\n\n    month of August, 2004, whereas, FIR in question was lodged in the\n\n    month of April, 2005 i.e. approximately after nine months of leaving the\n\n    house by the complainant. Mr. Thakur, further contended that there is\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                            ::: Downloaded on - 18/04/2017 00:09:21 :::HCHP</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                       -6-</span>\n\n\n\n\n    no explanation worth the name that why complainant kept mum for\n\n    nearly nine months, if cruelty, if any, was meted to her by the\n\n\n\n\n                                                               .\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_18\">    petitioner and his family members.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_19\">          7.    Mr. Ramesh Thakur, Deputy Advocate General, supported\n\n\n\n\n\n    the impugned judgments passed by the courts below. Mr. Ramesh\n\n    Thakur vehemently argued that bare perusal of the impugned\n\n    judgments of conviction recorded by courts below suggests that same\n\n\n\n\n\n    are based upon correct appreciation of evidence adduced on record by\n\n    the respective parties and there is no scope of interference by his\n\n    Court, especially in view of the concurrent findings of fact and law\n\n    recoded by the courts below. Mr. Thakur, with a view to refute\n\n    aforesaid contentions having been made by the learned counsel\n\n\n    representing the petitioner, also invited attention of this Court to the\n\n    judgments passed by the courts below to demonstrate that each and\n\n\n\n\n    every aspect of the matter has been dealt with meticulously by the\n\n\n\n\n\n    Courts below while holding petitioner guilty of having committed\n\n    offence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 498-A</a> IPC and as such there is no\n\n\n\n\n\n    illegality or infirmity in the impugned judgments and same deserve to\n\n    be upheld. While concluding his arguments,\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">          8.    Mr. Ramesh Thakur, Deputy Advocate General, reminded\n\n    this Court of its limited jurisdiction under Section 397 as far as re-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"655566\" id=\"span_11\">appreciation of evidence is concerned. He has placed reliance upon the\n\n    judgment passed by Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court in case <a href=\"/doc/655566/\" id=\"a_10\">State of Kerala versus\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                            ::: Downloaded on - 18/04/2017 00:09:21 :::HCHP</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                             -7-</span>\n\n\n\n\n    Puttumana Illath Jathavedan Namboodiri</a> (1999)2 Supreme Court\n\n    Cases 452, wherein it has been held as under:-</span>\n</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">                                                                     .\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">          &quot; In its revisional jurisdiction, the High Court can call for and examine the\n          record of any proceedings for the purpose of satisfying itself as to the\n          correctness, legality or propriety of any finding, sentence or order. In other\n          words, the jurisdiction is one of supervisory jurisdiction exercised by the High\n          Court for correcting miscarriage of justice. But the said revisional power\n\n\n\n\n\n          cannot be equated with the power of an appellate court nor can it be treated\n          even as a second appellate jurisdiction. Ordinarily, therefore, it would not be\n          appropriate for the High Court to re-appreciate the evidence and come to its\n          own conclusion on the same when the evidence has already been appreciated\n          by the Magistrate as well as Sessions Judge in appeal, unless any glaring\n          feature is brought to the notice of the High Court which would otherwise\n\n\n\n\n\n          tantamount to gross miscarriage of justice.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_22\">          9.

True, it is that while exercising the power under <a href=\"/doc/1457888/\" id=\"a_11\">Section\n\n\n    397</a> of Criminal Procedure Code, this Court has very limited power to\n\n    re-appreciate the evidence available on record. But in the present case,\n\n\n\n\n    where accused has been convicted and sentenced under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_12\">Sections 498-\n\n\n\n\n\n    A </a>IPC, this Court solely with a view to ascertain that the judgments\n\n    passed by both the Courts below are not perverse and the same are\n\n\n\n\n\n    based upon correct appreciation of evidence available on record,\n\n    undertook an exercise to critically examine the evidence available on\n\n    record to reach fair and just decision in the case.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">          11.    As far as scope of power of this Court while exercising\n\n    revisionary jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1865117/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 397</a> is concerned, the Hon&#x27;ble\n\n    Apex Court in Krishnan and another Versus                         Krishnaveni and\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                                  ::: Downloaded on - 18/04/2017 00:09:21 :::HCHP</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                              -8-</span>\n\n\n\n\n    another, (1997) 4 Supreme Court Case 241; has held that in case\n\n    Court notices that there is a failure of justice or misuse of judicial\n\n\n\n\n                                                                      .\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_25\">    mechanism or procedure, sentence or order is                       not correct, it is\n\n\n\n\n\n    salutary duty of the High Court to prevent the abuse of the process or\n\n    miscarriage    of   justice    or   to   correct       irregularities/incorrectness\n\n\n\n\n\n    committed by inferior criminal court in its judicial process or illegality\n\n    or sentence or order.

The object of <a href=\"/doc/1207578/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 483</a> and the purpose behind conferring the\n          revisional power under <a href=\"/doc/1865117/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 397</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/986100/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 401</a>, upon the High\n\n          Court is to invest continuous supervisory jurisdiction so as to prevent\n          miscarriage of justice or to correct irregularity of the procedure or to mete out\n\n          justice. In addition, the inherent power of the High Court is preserved by\n          <a href=\"/doc/903398/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 482</a>. The power of the High Court, therefore, is very wide.

This Court, solely with a view to find answer to the arguments\n\n\n\n\n\n    having been made by the learned counsel representing the petitioner,\n\n    carefully perused <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 498-A</a> IPC, perusal whereof certainly\n\n    suggests that &#x27;cruelty&#x27;, if any, is to be construed strictly in terms of\n\n    explanation given to aforesaid Section.

For the purpose of this Section,\n\n    &#x27;cruelty&#x27;    has been specifically defined.

This Court, after carefully examining\n\n\n\n\n\n    the evidence led on record by prosecution, sees substantial force in the\n\n    arguments having been made by the learned counsel representing the\n\n\n\n\n\n    petitioner that the prosecution was unable to prove on record that\n\n    complainant was meted cruelty as defined under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 498A</a> IPC and\n\n\n\n\n\n    as such no conviction, if any, could be recorded against the petitioner\n\n    under Section   r 498A <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_25\">IPC</a>. This Court, after carefully examining\n\n    evidence is also of the view that complainant made general allegations\n\n    and there is no specific allegation, if any, of demand of dowry either by\n\n    the petitioner or by his family members. There is nothing in the\n\n\n    statement of the complainant suggestive of the fact that demand was\n\n    ever made by petitioner or his family members, directly or indirectly,\n\n\n\n\n    from the complainant or from her parents, rather, complainant herself\n\n\n\n\n\n    stated that when she asked for maintenance from her husband,\n\n    petitioner told her that she had not brought anything from her house.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_32\">    Complainant has also stated that since her parents were poor, she had\n\n    not brought anything. But definitely, she stated nothing with regard to\n\n    demand of dowry made by the petitioner or family members of the\n\n    accused.   Similarly,   there   is   nothing        in    the    statement        of   the\n\n    complainant as well as other material prosecution witnesses suggestive\n\n    of the fact that conduct, if any, of the petitioner caused stress, if any,\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                                  ::: Downloaded on - 18/04/2017 00:09:21 :::HCHP</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_33\">                                        - 11 -\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_34\">    to the complainant, which could drive the complainant to either to\n\n    commit suicide or cause grave injury.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_35\">                                                                   .\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_36\">           14.   Interestingly,   apart from above, there is no explanation\n\n\n\n\n\n    worth the name on record that what prevented the complainant from\n\n    making complaint either to the police or Gram Panchayat from August,\n\n\n\n\n\n    2004 to 9.4.2005, which inaction on the part of the complainant\n\n    certainly compels this Court to draw an adverse inference against the\n\n\n\n\n\n    complainant, who, admittedly, kept mum for approximately for nine\n\n    months. If she was actually maltreated or meted cruelty, strictly in\n\n    terms of explanations (a) and (b) to <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 498A</a> IPC, she would have\n\n    lodged complaint with the Gram Panchayat or to the police immediately\n\n    in the month of August, 2004 but, neither complainant nor her family\n\n\n    members with whom she admittedly started living in August, 2004,\n\n    bothered to lodge complaint against petitioner as well as his family\n\n\n\n\n    members.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_37\">           15.   In the instant case, this Court was unable to lay its hand\n\n    on any evidence, be it ocular or documentary, suggestive of the fact\n\n\n\n\n\n    that   petitioner   had   ever   proclaimed        publically      or    teased      the\n\n    complainant that she was not his legally wedded wife and similarly,\n\n    this Court was unable to see any evidence on record that the petitioner\n\n    ever proclaimed publically that he was not the father of the child born\n\n    to the complainant.

At the cost of repetition, it may be\n\n    stated that there is/was no allegation as such, made by the\n\n\n\n\n\n    complainant rather, allegations, if any, were of misbehaviour by the\n\n    petitioner and his family members. Though complainant made an\n\n\n\n\n\n    attempt to state before police that she was given repeated beatings but,\n\n    unfortunately, there is no evidence available on record to support the\n\n    contention, if any, with regard to beatings.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_41\">          16.   This Court, after carefully examining the record is of the\n\n    view that the petitioner solely with a view to defend himself in the\n\n\n    proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 498A</a> IPC, initiated at the behest of the\n\n    complainant, took the defence, whereby he claimed that complainant\n\n\n\n\n    was not his legally wedded wife but, certainly, aforesaid defence taken\n\n\n\n\n\n    by the petitioner before the court below in the proceedings under\n\n    <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 498A</a> IPC nowhere amounts to &#x27;cruelty&#x27;, as defined under\n\n\n\n\n\n    <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 498A</a> IPC. Had the complainant alleged in the complaint and\n\n    stated before the Court that petitioner proclaimed publically that the\n\n    complainant was not his legally wedded wife and had the petitioner\n\n    disputed paternity of the child born to the complainant, Courts below\n\n    would have been right in concluding that complainant successfully\n\n    proved &#x27;cruelty&#x27; in terms of <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 498-A</a> IPC.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                                               ::: Downloaded on - 18/04/2017 00:09:21 :::HCHP</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\">                                           - 13 -\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_43\">          17.   Further, there are no specific allegations against petitioner\n\n    and all the allegations, if any, are/were against the whole of the family,\n\n\n\n\n                                                                      .\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_44\">    that too general and vague.

It is the conduct in relation to or                  in    respect\n                      of matrimonial duties and            obligations. It     is a    course of\n                      conduct of one which is adversely affecting the other. The\n                    r cruelty may be mental or                 physical, intentional             or\n\n                      unintentional.

First, the enquiry must begin as to the nature\n\n\n\n                      of the cruel treatment. Second, the impact of such\n                      treatment in the mind             of the spouse.          Whether          it\n                      caused reasonable apprehension that it would be harmful\n\n\n\n\n                      or injurious to live with the other. Ultimately, it is a matter\n\n\n\n\n\n                      of inference to be drawn by taking into account the nature\n                      of the conduct and its effect on the complaining spouse.\n                      There    may,     however,      be     cases     where    the        conduct\n\n\n\n\n\n                      complained of itself is bad enough and per                  se unlawful\n                      or illegal. Then the impact          or the injurious effect on the\n                      other spouse need not be enquired into or considered. In\n                      such cases, the cruelty will be established if the conduct\n                      itself is proved or admitted.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">                      5.

This is no longer the required standard. Now it would\n\n\n\n\n\n                      be sufficient to show that the conduct of one of the spouses\n                      is so abnormal and below the accepted norm that the other\n                      spouse could not reasonable be expected to put up with it.\n                      The conduct is no         longer required to be so atrociously\n\n\n\n\n\n                      abominable which would cause a reasonable apprehension\n                      that would be harmful or injurious to continue the\n                      cohabitation with the other spouse. Therefore, to establish\n                    r cruelty it is not necessary that physical violence should be\n\n                      used. However, continued ill-treatment cessation of marital\n                      intercourse, studied neglect, indifference of one spouse to\n                      the other may lead to an inference of cruelty.

It may be true that there is no definition of cruelty\n                      under the said Act. Actually such a definition is not\n                      possible.    In    matrimonial       relationship,          cruelty    would\n                      obviously      mean      absence       of        mutual      respect     and\n                      understanding between the spouses which embitters the\n                      relationship      and   often leads         to    various    outbursts    of\n                      behaviour which can be termed as cruelty. Sometime\n                      cruelty in a matrimonial relationship may take the form of\n                      violence, sometime it may take a different form.

Therefore, cruelty in matrimonial behaviour defies\n\n\n\n\n                                                        .\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_60\">        any definition and its categories can never be closed.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_61\">        Whether the husband is cruel to his wife or the wife is cruel\n        to her husband has to be ascertained and judged by taking\n        into account the entire facts and circumstances of the\n\n\n\n\n\n        given case and not by any predetermined rigid formula.\n        Cruelty in matrimonial case can be of infinite variety - it\n        may be subtle or even brutal and may be by gestures and\n        word. That possible explains why Lord Denning in Sheldon\n\n\n\n\n\n        v.

This Court is reminded of what was said by Lord Reid in\n        Gollins v. Gollins about judging cruelty in matrimonial\n\n        cases. The pertinent observations are (AC p.660)\n\n                  &quot;.. In matrimonial cases we are not concerned with\n                  the reasonable man as we are in cases of negligence.\n                  We are dealing with this man and this woman and\n                  the fewer a priori assumptions we make about them\n\n\n\n                  the better. In cruelty cases one can hardly ever even\n                  start with a presumption that the parties are\n                  reasonable people, because it is hard to imagine any\n\n\n\n\n                  cruelty case ever arising if both the spouses think\n\n\n\n\n\n                  and behave as reasonable people.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_95\">        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1100461\" id=\"span_48\">22.   &quot;    About   the   changing       perception      of   cruelty    in\n\n\n\n\n\n        matrimonial cases, this Court observed in <a href=\"/doc/1100461/\" id=\"a_71\">Shobha Rani v.\n        Madhukar Reddi</a> at AIR p. 123, para 5 of the report: (SCC\n        p.108, para 5)\n                  &quot;5.
