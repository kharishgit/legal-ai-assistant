The appellant herein challenges the order passed by the High\n\nCourt whereby the petition filed by her was dismissed.      The said\n\npetition was filed under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_1\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India read\n\nwith <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 482</a> of the Criminal Procedure Code for quashing the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">\f                                  2</span>\n\n\nFIR No. 138/08 dated 07.08.2008 for offences under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 498A</a>\n\nand <a href=\"/doc/988620/\" id=\"a_4\">406</a>, Indian Penal Code in the Chitranjan Park Police Station.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">3.   This FIR was lodged by one Gunjan Sujanani, wife of one Rohit\n\nSujanani.   It is a long document wherein the complainant Gunjan\n\nSujanani stated about her marriage with Rohit on 08.07.2003 and he\n\nbeing a resident of Nigeria. It was claimed that before the marriage,\n\nRohit had introduced Gunjan to one Mr. Sham and Mrs. Lavina\n\nDaswani as his foster parents and also said that he had two foster\n\nsisters, namely, Vijeta Daswani (Vijeta Gajra-the appellant herein)\n\nwho is a resident of Indore, Madhya Pradesh and the other being one\n\nMs. Ritika Daswani, who resided with her mother in London. There\n\nare allegations made about the demand of dowry against the\n\nhusband as also Mrs. Lavina Daswani. The demand included\n\ndiamond neckless for Vijeta Daswani/Gajra. There was reference to\n\nsubsequent behaviour of troubling the complainant on account of the\n\ndowry demands.      The First Information Report also made some\n\nallegations regarding the relations of her husband Rohit Sujanani with\n\nMrs. Lavina Daswani and Vijeta Daswani/Gajra, the present\n\nappellant. It was then contended that in December, 2003, when the\n\ncomplainant had gone to Sierra Leone, Vijeta Dasawani/Gajra took\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">\f                                   3</span>\n\n\naway her diamond encrusted heavy gold pendant and chain and\n\nearring set on the pretext that she wanted to wear them once and she\n\nwould keep them at a safe place in her father&#x27;s house. The\n\ncomplainant also stated that she did not return these ornaments.\n\nFurther, it was stated that in May, 2004, Mr. Rohit Sujanani and Mrs.\n\nLavina Daswani insisted that the complainant should keep her\n\njewellery in London and claimed that she was slapped by her\n\nhusband on her refusal. It was further claimed that in November,\n\n2004, the present appellant, Vijeta Gajra got married during which the\n\ncomplainant had to beg for her ornaments for attending the marriage.\n\nThere was a reference in the FIR to the misbehaviour on the part of\n\nMrs. Lavina Daswani towards her and again the name of the present\n\nappellant figured therein. At this time, the complainant claimed that\n\nshe was pregnant for the first time and yet she was given physical\n\nand mental ill treatment because of which she had a mis-carriage.\n\nThere is a reference to the sexual behaviour of her husband with\n\nreference to a pornographic website.        It was claimed that the\n\ncomplainant delivered a baby on 08.03.2007. Then there is reference\n\nto the appellant visiting and staying with the complainant&#x27;s parents for\n\nthree days and the allegation that her husband was having sexual\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">\f                                  4</span>\n\n\nrelations with Vijeta Gajra, the appellant herein and Mrs.Lavina\n\nDaswani. There was a reference that during her stay the appellant\n\nwas wearing the diamond encrusted pendant and gold chain and\n\nearring set which she had taken (practically stolen) in Sierra Leone.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_7\">4.   In the last part of this lengthy FIR, there was a reference to the\n\ndemand of two crores of rupees having been made by Vijeta and her\n\nmother over the phone to the complainant as a cost of peace and\n\nmarital happiness.      There was a reference to a telephonic\n\nconversation with Mrs. Lavina Daswani in this regard.     There was a\n\nfurther reference to an ugly scene on account of arguments.\n\nHowever, there was also a reference to the presence of the brother of\n\nthe complainant on account of which further ugly scenes were\n\navoided. It was complained that, thereafter, the complainant and her\n\nparents tried to contact Rohit Sujanani and the Daswanis who were\n\navoiding them and not returning jewellery which was with Vijeta\n\nGajra, Lavina Daswani and Rohit Sujanani.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_8\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">5.   This complaint dated 15.04.2008 seems to have been\n\nregistered as an FIR. It seems that on the basis of this FIR, the\n\nappellant was sent a summons under <a href=\"/doc/518086/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 160</a>, Cr. P.C. and she\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">\f                                   5</span>\n\n\nmoved the Court of Additional Sessions Judge, New Delhi under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1783708/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 438</a> Cr.P.C. for grant of anticipatory bail. In that application,\n\nshe had made a reference to the summons asking her to appear on\n\n05.06.2008. It was claimed in the application that the complainant&#x27;s\n\nhusband Rohit Sujanani was an employee of appellant&#x27;s father who\n\nhas business in Sierra Leone and that he was employed on contract\n\nbasis for the period of three years in 1994. It was claimed in that\n\napplication that the appellant had met the complainant last in 2007. It\n\nwas also stated that the allegations made in the FIR were concocted,\n\nfalse and baseless and she had no connection whatsoever with the\n\nfamily of the complainant or her parents. She complained that her\n\nown marriage was being tried to be destroyed by wild allegations.\n\nThere was a reference made in this application by the appellant for\n\nquashing the summons arising out of the complaint dated 15.04.2008\n\nand also to a Criminal Miscellaneous Petition No. 2153 of 2008. The\n\nHigh Court had passed the order disposing it of since the State&#x27;s\n\nCounsel had agreed to provide copy of the complaint and had further\n\nstated that in the event the FIR was registered, the applicant would\n\nbe informed of this fact and no coercive action would be taken\n\nagainst her till then. In her application there was a statement that she\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">\f                                   6</span>\n\n\ndid not even belong to the family of the complainant, her husband or\n\nany of their relatives and that all the allegations were palpably false.\n\nIt was then stated that the writ petition was filed which came to be\n\ndisposed of by the High Court. It seems that the complainant sought\n\nthe direction to implead herself in the writ petition-cum-<a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 482</a>\n\nCr.P.C application filed by the appellant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_11\">6.    Following are the prayers in the said writ petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_8\">Article\n\n226</a> of the Constitution of India read with <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 482</a>, Cr.P.C.:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">                &quot;a) Quash the FIR NO. 138/2008 dated\n         07.08.2008 under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_10\">Sections 498A</a>/<a href=\"/doc/988620/\" id=\"a_11\">406</a>, IPC at Police\n         Station Chitranjan Park registered against the\n         petitioner;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">               b) Direct the police not to take any coercive\n         action against the petitioner in respect of the above\n         said complaint:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">               c) Pass such other and further orders which\n         may be deemed fit and proper in the facts and\n         circumstances of the case.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_12\">      It is on this backdrop that we have to see as to whether it would\n\nbe expedient to continue the criminal prosecution against the\n\nappellant.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">\f                                  7</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"953117\" id=\"span_7\">7.   Shri U.U. Lalit, Learned Senior Counsel, appearing on behalf of\n\nthe appellant argued that in <a href=\"/doc/953117/\" id=\"a_12\">U. Suvetha v. State By Inspector of\n\nPolice &amp; Anr.</a> [(2009) 6 SCC 757], it was specifically held that in\n\norder to be covered under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 498A</a>, IPC one has to be a\n\n`relative&#x27; of the husband by blood, marriage or adoption. He pointed\n\nout that the present appellant was not in any manner a `relative&#x27; as\n\nreferred to in <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 498A</a>, IPC and, therefore, there is no question\n\nof any allegation against her in respect of the ill-treatment of the\n\ncomplainant.   The Court in this case examined the ingredients of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 498A</a>, IPC and noting the specific language of the Section\n\nand the Explanation thereof came to the conclusion that the word\n\n`relative&#x27; would not include a paramour or concubine or so. Relying\n\non the dictionary meaning of the word `relative&#x27; and further relying on\n\nR. Ramanatha Aiyar&#x27;s Advance Law Lexicon, Volume 4, 3rd Edition,\n\nthe Court went on to hold that <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 498A</a>, IPC being a penal\n\nprovision would deserve strict construction and unless a contextual\n\nmeaning is required to be given to the statute, the said statute has to\n\nbe construed strictly.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"830364\" id=\"span_8\">On that behalf the Court relied on the judgment\n\nin <a href=\"/doc/830364/\" id=\"a_17\">T. Ashok Pai v. CIT</a> [(2007) 7 SCC 162].</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"145448\" id=\"span_9\">A reference was made\n\nto the decision in <a href=\"/doc/145448/\" id=\"a_18\">Shivcharan Lal Verma &amp; Anr. v. State of M.P.</a>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">\f                                  8</span>\n\n\n[(2007) 15 SCC 369]. After quoting from various decisions of this\n\nCourt, it was held that reference to the word `relative&#x27; in <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_19\">Section\n\n498A</a>, IPC would be limited only to the blood relations or the relations\n\nby marriage.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_15\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_16\">8.     Relying heavily on this, Shri Lalit contended that there is no\n\nquestion of any trial of the appellant for the offence under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_20\">Section\n\n498A</a>, IPC. The argument is undoubtedly correct, though opposed by\n\nthe Learned Counsel appearing for the State. We are of the opinion\n\nthat there will be no question of her prosecution under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 498A</a>,\n\nIPC.     Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the\n\ncomplainant, Shri Soli J. Sorabjee, also did not seriously dispute this\n\nproposition. Therefore, we hold that the FIR insofar as it concerned\n\n<a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 498A</a>, IPC, would be of no consequence and the appellant\n\nshall not be tried for the offence under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 498A</a>, IPC.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">9.     That leaves us with the allegation under <a href=\"/doc/988620/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 406</a>, IPC for\n\nthe offence of criminal breach of trust as there are allegations in\n\nrespect of the jewellery.   We desist from saying anything at this\n\njuncture. We also desist from going into the correctness or otherwise\n\nof these allegations as they will have to be proved by evidence. Shri\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">\f                                   9</span>\n\n\nLalit pointed out that on the face of it the allegations are wild and\n\nbaseless as the appellant herself comes from a wealthy background\n\nand is a married lady having settled down in Indore and is also\n\nmother of a child. He pointed that the FIR is calculated to destroy her\n\nmarital life with the wildest possible allegations and, therefore, we\n\nshould quash the entire FIR as not being bona fide and actuated by\n\nmalice.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_18\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_19\">10.   There can be no doubt that the allegations made are extremely\n\nwild and disgusting. However, how far those allegations can be used\n\nto meet the requirements for the offence under <a href=\"/doc/988620/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 406</a>, IPC is a\n\nmoot question. For obvious reasons, we will not go into that exercise.\n\nWhatever the form in which the allegations under <a href=\"/doc/988620/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 406</a>, IPC\n\nare made, the fact of the matter is that there is an FIR and the Court\n\nconcerned    has    taken    cognizance     thereof.     Under     these\n\ncircumstances, we would only protect the interest of the appellant by\n\ndirecting that she would not be required to attend the proceedings\n\nunless specifically directed by the Court to do so and that too in the\n\ncase of extreme necessity. Similarly, no coercive step shall be taken\n\nagainst her. She shall be granted bail by the Court trying the case if it\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">\f                                  1</span>\n\n\ndecides to try the offence by framing the charge. We expect the\n\nCourt to be careful while considering the framing of charge.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_20\">11.   We, therefore, hold that the appellant shall not be tried for\n\noffence under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 498A</a>, IPC. However, we desist from quashing\n\nthe FIR altogether in view of the allegations made under <a href=\"/doc/988620/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 406</a>,\n\nIPC with the protection that we have granted to the appellant. With\n\nthese observations, the appeals are disposed of.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">                                            ...............................J.\n                                            [V.S.
