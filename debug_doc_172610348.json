These appeals have been put up before this Bench of three\n\nJudges in pursuance of order of Bench of two Judges dated 9th\n\nSeptember, 2013 as follows:\n\n          “Leave granted.\n\n          Learned counsel for the parties are agreed that\n          there is considerable difference of opinion\n          amongst different Benches of this Court as well\n          as all the High Courts. Mr. Ram Jethmalani,\n          learned Senior Counsel appearing for petitioner\n          in Criminal Appeal arising out of Special Leave\n          Petition (Criminal)No.6470 of 2012 submits that\n          the subsequent decisions rendered by the two-\n          judge Benches are per incuriam, and in conflict\n          with the ratio of law laid down in the\n          Constitution Bench decision in Mohanlal\n          Maganlal Thacker v. State of Gujarat [(1968) 2\n          SCR 685].\n\n          In this view of the matter, we are of the opinion\n          that it would be appropriate if the matters are\n          referred to and heard by a larger Bench.\n          Office is directed to place the matters before\n          the Hon’ble the Chief Justice of India for\n          appropriate orders.\n\n          In the meantime, further proceedings before\n          the trial Court shall remain stayed.”\n\n                                  2\n\f2.   Since the question of law to be determined is identical in all\n\ncases, we have taken up for consideration this matter. In the light of\n\nanswer to the referred question this as well as all other matters may\n\nbe considered for disposal on merits by the appropriate Bench.\n\n\n3.   Brief facts first. F.I.R. dated 7th March, 2001 has been recorded\n\nwith the Delhi Special Police Establishment: CBI/SIU-VIII/New Delhi\n\nBranch under Section 120B read with <a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_1\">Sections 420</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1985627/\" id=\"a_2\">467</a>, <a href=\"/doc/556166/\" id=\"a_3\">468</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1466184/\" id=\"a_4\">471</a> and\n\n<a href=\"/doc/896188/\" id=\"a_5\">477A</a> of IPC and <a href=\"/doc/86648814/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 13(2)</a> read with 13(1)(d) of the <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_7\">Prevention of\n\nCorruption Act, 1988</a> (the <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_8\">PC Act</a>)      at the instance of Municipal\n\nCorporation of Delhi (MCD) against the appellant         and certain\n\nofficers of MCD alleging causing of wrongful loss to the MCD by\n\nusing fake invoices of Oil Companies relating to transportation of\n\nBitumen for use in “Dense Carpeting Works” of roads in Delhi during\n\nthe year 1997 and 1998.\n\n\n4.   After investigation, charge sheet was filed against the\n\nappellant and certain employees of MCD by the respondent-CBI\n\nbefore the Special Judge, CBI, New Delhi on 28th November, 2002.\n\n                                  3\n\fThe appellants filed an application for discharge with the Special\n\nJudge, CBI.   On 1st February, 2007, the Special Judge, CBI directed\n\nframing of the charges after considering the material before the\n\nCourt. It was held that there was a prima facie case against the\n\nappellant and the other accused.         The appellants filed Criminal\n\nRevision No. 321 of 2007 before the Delhi High Court against the\n\norder framing charge. The Revision Petition was converted into Writ\n\nPetition (Criminal)No.352 of 2010.\n\n\n5.   Learned Single Judge referred the following question of law for\n\nconsideration by the Division Bench:\n\n          “Whether an order on charge framed by a\n          Special Judge under the provisions of\n          <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_9\">Prevention of Corruption Act</a>, being an\n          interlocutory order, and when no revision\n          against the order or a petition under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_10\">Section\n          482</a> of Cr.P.C. lies, can be assailed under Article\n          226/227 of the Constitution of India, whether or\n          not the offences committed include the\n          offences under <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_11\">Indian Penal Code</a> apart from\n          offences under <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_12\">Prevention of Corruption Act</a>?”\n\n\n6.   The learned Single Judge referred to the conflicting views taken\n\nin earlier two single Bench decisions of the High Court in Dharambir\n\n\n                                     4\n\fKhattar versus Central Bureau of Investigation1and R.C. Sabharwal\n\nversus Central Bureau of Investigation 2. It was observed :\n\n            “However, since there are two views, one\n            expressed by the Bench of Justice Jain in R.C.\n            Sabharwal&#x27;s (supra) case and one held by the\n            Bench of Justice Muralidhar in Dharamvir\n            Khattar&#x27;s case (supra) and by this Bench, I\n            consider that it was a fit case where a Larger\n            Bench should set the controversy at rest.”\n\n\n7.    In Dharambir Khattar (supra), the view of learned Single Judge\n\nis as follows :\n\n            “32. To conclude this part of the discussion it is\n            held that in the context of <a href=\"/doc/1457437/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 19(3)(c)</a> the\n            words &quot;no Court shall exercise the powers of\n            revision in relation to any interlocutory order\n            passed in any inquiry, trial...&quot; includes an\n            interlocutory order in the form of an order on\n            charge or an order framing charge. On a\n            collective reading of the decisions in V.C.\n            Shukla and Satya Narayan Sharma, it is held\n            that in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1457437/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 19(3)(c)</a> PCA, no\n            revision petition would be maintainable in the\n            High Court against order on charge or an order\n            framing charge passed by the Special Court.\n\n            33. Therefore, in the considered view of this\n            Court, the preliminary objection of the CBI to\n\n\n\n1\n                       159 (2009) DLT 636\n2\n                       166(2010) DLT 362\n\n                                            5\n\f            the maintainability of the present petitions is\n            required to be upheld....”\n\n\n8.   In R.C. Sabharwal (supra), another learned Single Judge held\n\nthat even though no revision may lie against an interlocutory order,\n\nthere was no bar to the constitutional remedy under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_15\">Articles 226</a> and\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1331149/\" id=\"a_16\">227</a> of the Constitution. At the same time, power under Section 482\n\ncould not be exercised in derogation of express bar in the statute in\n\nview of decisions of this Court in CBI          versus   Ravi Shankar\n\nSrivastava3, Dharimal Tobacco Products Ltd. and Ors. versus State of\n\nMaharashtra and Anr. 4 , Madhu Limaye           versus    The State of\n\nMaharashtra 5, Krishnan versus Krishnaveni6 and State versus Navjot\n\nSandhu 7.\n\n9.   It was observed :\n\n            “37.     In    view     of    the   authoritative\n            pronouncement of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court\n            in the case of Navjot Sandhu (supra), coupled\n            with its earlier decisions in the case of Madhu\n            Limaye (supra), it cannot be disputed that\n            inherent powers of the High Court, recognized\n\n\n3\n                       (2006)7 SCC 188\n4\n                       AIR 2009 SC 1032\n5\n                       (1977) 4 SCC 551\n6\n                       (1997) 4 SCC 241\n7\n                       (2003) 6 SCC 641\n\n                                          6\n\fin <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 482</a> of the Code of Criminal\nProcedure, cannot be used when exercise of\nsuch powers would be in derogation of an\nexpress bar contained in a statutory\nenactment, other than the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_18\">Code of Criminal\nProcedure</a>. The inherent powers of the High\nCourt have not been limited by any other\nprovisions contained in the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_19\">Code of Criminal\nProcedure</a>, as is evident from the use of the\nwords ?Nothing in this Code? in <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 482</a> of\nthe Code of Criminal Procedure, but, the\npowers under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 482</a> of the Code of\nCriminal Procedure cannot be exercised when\nexercise of such powers would be against the\nlegislative mandate contained in some other\nstatutory enactment such as <a href=\"/doc/1457437/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 19(3)(c)</a> of\nPrevention of Corruption Act.”\n\n&quot;29. The fact that the procedural aspect as\nregards the hearing of the parties has been\nincorporated in <a href=\"/doc/889478/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 22</a> does not really\nthrow light on whether an order on charge\nwould be an interlocutory order for the\npurposes of <a href=\"/doc/1457437/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 19(3)(c)</a> PCA. A collective\nreading of the two provisions indicates that in\nthe context of order on charge an order\ndischarging the accused may be an order that\nwould be subject-matter of a revision petition\nat the instance perhaps of the prosecution.\nSince all provisions of the statute have to be\ngiven meaning, a harmonious construction of\nthe three provisions indicates that the kinds of\norders which can be challenged by way of a\nrevision petition in the High Court is narrowed\ndown to a considerable extent as explained in\nthe case of Satya Narayan Sharma.”\n\n\n                       7\n\f     Further, after referring to Nagendra Nath Bora v. Commissioner\n\nof Hills Division and Appeals, Assam, AIR 1958 SC 398; Nihandra Bag\n\nv. Mahendra Nath Ghughu, AIR 1963 SC 1895; Sarpanch, Lonand\n\nGrampanchayat v. Ramgiri Gosavi and Anr., AIR 1968 SC 222; Maruti\n\nBala Raut v. Dashrath Babu Wathare and Ors., (1974) 2 SCC 615;\n\nBabhutmal Raichand Oswal v. Laxmibai R. Tarte and Anr., AIR 1975\n\nSC 1297; Jagir Singh v. Ranbir Singh and Anr., AIR 1979 SC 381;\n\nVishesh Kumar v. Shanti Prasad, AIR       1980 SC 892; Khalil Ahmed\n\nBashir Ahmed v. Tufelhussein Samasbhai Sarangpurwala, AIR 1988 SC\n\n184; M.C. Mehta v. Kamal Nath and Ors., AIR 2000 SC 1997 and\n\nRanjeet Singh v. Ravi Prakash, AIR 2004 SC 3892, it was observed :\n\n          “25. It is well known fact that trials of corruption\n          cases are not permitted to proceed further\n          easily and a trial of corruption case takes\n          anything upto 20 years in completion. One\n          major reason for this state of affairs is that the\n          moment charge is framed, every trial lands into\n          High Court and order on charge is invariably\n          assailed by the litigants and the High Court\n          having flooded itself with such revision petitions,\n          would take any number of years in deciding\n          the revision petitions on charge and the trials\n          would remain stayed. Legislature looking at this\n          state of affairs, enacted provision that\n          interlocutory orders cannot be the subject\n          matter of revision petitions. This Court for\n\n                                   8\n\freasons as stated above, in para No. 3 &amp; 4 had\nconsidered the state of affairs prevalent and\ncame to conclusion that no revision against the\norder of framing of charge or order directing\nframing of charge would lie. Similarly, a petition\nunder Section 482 of Cr. P.C. would also not lie.\nI am of the opinion that once this Court holds\nthat a petition under <a href=\"/doc/1331149/\" id=\"a_25\">Article 227</a> would lie, the\nresult would be as is evident from the above\npetitions that every order on charge which\nearlier used to be assailed by way of revision\nwould be assailed in a camouflaged manner\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1331149/\" id=\"a_26\">Article 227</a> of the Constitution and the\nresult would be same that proceedings before\nthe trial court shall not proceed.\n\n26. The decisions on a petition assailing charge\nrequires going through the voluminous\nevidence collected by the CBI, analyzing the\nevidence against each accused and then\ncoming to conclusion whether the accused\nwas liable to be charged or not. This exercise is\ndone by Special Judge invariably vide a\ndetailed speaking order. Each order on charge\nof the Special Judge, under Prevention of\nCorruption cases, normally runs into 40 to 50\npages where evidence is discussed in detail\nand thereafter the order for framing of charge\nis made. If this Court entertains petitions under\n<a href=\"/doc/1331149/\" id=\"a_27\">Article 227</a> of the Constitution to re-appreciate\nthe evidence collected by CBI to see if charge\nwas liable to be framed or, in fact, the Court\nwould be doing so contrary to the legislative\nintent. No court can appreciate arguments\nadvanced in a case on charge without going\nthrough the entire record. The issues of\njurisdiction and perversity are raised in such\n\n                        9\n\f           petitions only to get the petition admitted. The\n           issue of jurisdiction is rarely involved. The\n           perversity of an order can be argued in respect\n           of any well written judgment because\n           perversity is such a term which has a vast\n           meaning and an order which is not considered\n           by a litigant in its favour is always considered\n           perverse by him and his counsel. Therefore,\n           entertaining a petition under <a href=\"/doc/1331149/\" id=\"a_28\">Article 227</a> of the\n           Constitution against an order on charge would\n           amount to doing indirectly the same thing\n           which cannot be done directly, I consider that\n           no petition under <a href=\"/doc/1331149/\" id=\"a_29\">Article 227</a> can be\n           entertained.”\n                                           (Emphasis added)\n\n10.   The Division Bench in the impugned judgment8 reframed the\n\nquestions as follows:\n\n           “(a) Whether an order framing charge under\n                the 1988 Act would be treated as an\n                interlocutory order thereby barring the\n                exercise of revisional power of this Court?\n\n           (b)   Whether the language employed in\n                 <a href=\"/doc/97670/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 19</a> of the 1988 Act which bars the\n                 revision would also bar the exercise of\n                 power under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 482</a> of the Cr.P.C. for\n                 all purposes?\n\n           (c)   Whether the order framing charge can be\n                 assailed under <a href=\"/doc/1331149/\" id=\"a_32\">Article 227</a> of the\n                 Constitution of India?”\n\n\n\n8\n                        Anur Kumar Jain versus CBI 178(2011) DLT 501\n\n                                           10\n\f11.   After discussing the law on the point, the Bench concluded:\n\n           “(a) An order framing charge under the\n           <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_33\">Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988</a> is an\n           interlocutory order.\n\n           (b) As <a href=\"/doc/1457437/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 19(3)(c)</a> clearly bars revision\n           against an interlocutory order and framing of\n           charge being an interlocutory order a revision\n           will not be maintainable.\n\n           (c) A petition under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 482</a> of the Code of\n           Criminal Procedure and a writ petition\n           preferred under <a href=\"/doc/1331149/\" id=\"a_36\">Article 227</a> of the Constitution\n           of India are maintainable.\n\n           (d) Even if a petition under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 482</a> of the\n           Code of Criminal Procedure or a writ petition\n           under <a href=\"/doc/1331149/\" id=\"a_38\">Article 227</a> of the Constitution of India is\n           entertained by the High Court under no\n           circumstances an order of stay should be\n           passed regard being had to the prohibition\n           contained in <a href=\"/doc/1457437/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 19(3)(c)</a> of the 1988 Act.\n\n           (e) The exercise of power either under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_40\">Section\n           482</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure or under\n           <a href=\"/doc/1331149/\" id=\"a_41\">Article 227</a> of the Constitution of India should be\n           sparingly and in exceptional circumstances be\n           exercised keeping in view the law laid down in\n           Siya Ram Singh [(1979) 3 SCC 118], Vishesh\n           Kumar [AIR 1980 SC 892], Khalil Ahmed Bashir\n           Ahmed [AIR 1988 SC 184, Kamal Nath and Ors.\n           [AIR 2000 SC 1997 Ranjeet Singh [AIR 2004 SC\n           3892] and similar line of decisions in the field.\n\n           (f) It is settled law that jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_42\">Section\n           482</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure or under\n\n                                    11\n\f               <a href=\"/doc/1331149/\" id=\"a_43\">Article 227</a> of the Constitution of India cannot\n               be exercised as a &quot;cloak of an appeal in\n               disguise&quot; or to re-appreciate evidence. The\n               aforesaid proceedings should be used\n               sparingly    with     great    care,    caution,\n               circumspection and only to prevent grave\n               miscarriage of justice.”\n\n\n12.       It was held that order framing charge was an interlocutory\n\norder and no Revision Petition under Section 401 read with <a href=\"/doc/1846048/\" id=\"a_44\">Section\n\n397(2)</a> Cr.P.C. would lie to the High Court against such order.\n\nReliance was mainly placed on V.C. Shukla versus State through\n\nCBI 9 .     Therein, <a href=\"/doc/701797/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 11A</a> of the Special Courts Act, 1979 was\n\ninterpreted by a Bench of four Judges of this Court. The Bench\n\napplied the test in S. Kuppuswami Rao versus the King 10. Reliance\n\nwas also placed on Satya Narayan Sharma versus State of\n\nRajasthan 11, wherein <a href=\"/doc/1457437/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 19 (3)(c)</a> of the Prevention of Corruption\n\nAct, 1988 was the subject matter of consideration.\n\n13.       It was, however, held that a petition under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C.\n\nwill lie to the High Court even when there is a bar under Section 397\n\nor some other provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_48\">Cr.P.C</a>. However, inherent power\n\n9\n                          (1980) Suppl. SCC 92\n10\n                          (1947) 2 SCR 685\n11\n                          (2001) 8 SCC 607\n\n                                             12\n\fcould be exercised only when there is abuse of the process of Court\n\nor where interference is absolutely necessary for securing the ends of\n\njustice. It must be exercised very sparingly where proceedings have\n\nbeen initiated illegally, vexatiously or without jurisdiction. The power\n\nshould not be exercised against express provision of law.          Even\n\nwhere inherent power is exercised in a rare case, there could be no\n\nstay of trial in a corruption case. Reliance in this regard was mainly\n\nplaced on judgments of this Court in Satya Narayan Sharma (supra)\n\nand Navjot Sandhu (supra).\n\n14.   As regards a petition under <a href=\"/doc/1331149/\" id=\"a_49\">Article 227</a> of the Constitution, it was\n\nheld that the said power was part of basic structure of the\n\nConstitution as held in L. Chandra Kumar versus Union of India and\n\nOrs. 12 and could not be barred. But the Court would refrain from\n\npassing an order which would run counter to and conflict with an\n\nexpress intendment contained in <a href=\"/doc/1457437/\" id=\"a_50\">Section 19(3)(c)</a> of the PC Act.\n\nReliance was also placed on Chander Shekhar Singh versus Siya\n\nRam Singh13.\n\n\n\n12\n                      (1997) 3 SCC 261\n13\n                       (1979) 3 SCC 118\n\n                                          13\n\f15.   Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the High\n\nCourt was in error in holding that the order framing charge was an\n\ninterlocutory order. In any case, since petition under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 482</a>\n\nCr.P.C. and under <a href=\"/doc/1331149/\" id=\"a_52\">Article 227</a> of the Constitution has been held to be\n\nmaintainable, there could be no prohibition against interference by\n\nthe High Court or the power of the High Court to grant stay in spite of\n\nprohibition under <a href=\"/doc/1457437/\" id=\"a_53\">Section 19(3)(c)</a> of the PC Act.\n\n16.   Learned counsel for the CBI, however, supported the view of\n\nthe High Court.\n\n17.   We have given due considerations to the rival submissions and\n\nperused the decisions of this Court. Though the question referred\n\nrelates to the issue whether order framing charges is an interlocutory\n\norder, we have considered further question as to the approach to\n\nbe adopted by the High Court in dealing with the challenge to the\n\norder framing charge. As already noted in para 10, the impugned\n\norder also considered the said question. Learned counsel for the\n\nparties have also addressed the Court on this question.\n\n\n\n\n                                  14\n\f18.   It is not necessary to refer to all the decisions cited at the Bar.\n\nSuffice it to say that a Bench of three Judges in Madhu Limaye\n\n(supra) held that legislature has sought to check delay in final\n\ndisposal of proceedings in criminal cases by way of a bar to\n\nrevisional jurisdiction against an interlocutory order under sub-<a href=\"/doc/62140/\" id=\"a_54\">Section\n\n2</a> of <a href=\"/doc/1457888/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 397</a> Cr.P.C. At the same time, inherent power of the\n\nHigh Court is not limited or affected by any other provision. It could\n\nnot mean that limitation on exercise of revisional power is to be set\n\nat naught.     Inherent power could be used for securing ends of\n\njustice or to check abuse of the process of the Court. This power has\n\nto be exercised very sparingly against a proceeding initiated illegally\n\nor vexatiously or without jurisdiction.        The label of the petition is\n\nimmaterial. This Court modified the view taken in Amarnath versus\n\nState of Haryana14 and also deviated from the test for interlocutory\n\norder laid down in S. Kuppuswami Rao (supra). We may quote the\n\nfollowing observations in this regard:\n\n           “6. The point which falls for determination in this\n           appeal is squarely covered by a decision of this\n           Court, to which one of us (Untwalia, J.) was a\n\n\n14\n                       (1977) 4 SCC 137\n\n                                          15\n\fparty in Amar Nath v. State of Haryana. But on\na careful consideration of the matter and on\nhearing learned Counsel for the parties in this\nappeal we thought it advisable to enunciate\nand reiterate the view taken by two learned\nJudges of this Court in Amar Nath case but in a\nsomewhat modified and modulated form. …..\n\nxxxx            xxxx             xxxx       xxxx\n\n10. As pointed out in Amar Nath case the\npurpose of putting a bar on the power of\nrevision in relation to any interlocutory order\npassed in an appeal, inquiry, trial or other\nproceeding, is to bring about expeditious\ndisposal of the cases finally. More often than\nnot, the revisional power of the High Court was\nresorted to in relation to interlocutory orders\ndelaying the final disposal of the proceedings.\nThe Legislature in its wisdom decided to check\nthis delay by introducing sub-section (2) in\nSection 397. On the one hand, a bar has been\nput in the way of the High Court (as also of the\nSessions Judge) for exercise of the revisional\npower in relation to any interlocutory order, on\nthe other, the power has been conferred in\nalmost the same terms as it was in the 1898\nCode. On a plain reading of Section 482,\nhowever, it would follow that nothing in the\nCode, which would include sub-section (2) of\nSection 397 also, “shall be deemed to limit or\naffect the inherent powers of the High Court”,\nBut, if we were to say that the said bar is not to\noperate in the exercise of the inherent power\nat all, it will be setting at naught one of the\nlimitations imposed upon the exercise of the\nrevisional powers. In such a situation, what is\n\n                        16\n\fthe harmonious way out? In our opinion, a\nhappy solution of this problem would be to say\nthat the bar provided in sub-section (2) of\nSection 397 operates only in exercise of the\nrevisional power of the High Court, meaning\nthereby that the High Court will have no power\nof revision in relation to any interlocutory order.\nThen in accordance with one of the other\nprinciples enunciated above, the inherent\npower will come into play, there being no other\nprovision in the Code for the redress of the\ngrievance of the aggrieved party. But then, if\nthe order assailed is purely of an interlocutory\ncharacter which could be corrected in\nexercise of the revisional power of the High\nCourt under the 1898 Code, the High Court will\nrefuse to exercise its inherent power. But in case\nthe impugned order clearly brings about a\nsituation which is an abuse of the process of the\nCourt or for the purpose of securing the ends of\njustice interference by the High Court is\nabsolutely necessary, then nothing contained\nin section 397(2) can limit or affect the exercise\nof the inherent power by the High Court. But\nsuch cases would be few and far between. The\nHigh Court must exercise the inherent power\nvery sparingly. One such case would be the\ndesirability of the quashing of, a criminal\nproceeding initiated illegally, vexatiously or as\nbeing without jurisdiction. Take for example a\ncase where a prosecution is launched under\nthe <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_56\">Prevention of Corruption Act</a> without a\nsanction. then the trial of the accused will be\nwithout jurisdiction and even after his acquittal\na second trial after proper sanction will not be\nbarred on the doctrine of Autrefois Acquit.\nEven assuming, although we shall presently\n\n                        17\n\fshow that it is not so, that in such a case an\norder of the Court taking cognizance or issuing\nprocesses is an interlocutory order. does it stand\nto reason to say that inherent power of the\nHigh Court cannot be exercised for stopping\nthe criminal proceeding as early as possible,\ninstead of harassing the accused upto the end\n? The answer is obvious that the bar will not\noperate to prevent the abuse of the process of\nthe Court and/or to secure, the ends of justice.\nThe label of the petition filed by an aggrieved\nparty is immaterial. The High Court can\nexamine the matter in an appropriate case\nunder its inherent powers. The present case\nundoubtedly falls for exercise of the power of\nthe High Court in accordance with section\n482 of the 1973 Code, even assuming, although\nnot accepting, that invoking the revisional\npower of the High Court is impermissible.\n\nxxxx            xxxx             xxxx       xxxx\n\n13. …..But in our judgment such an\ninterpretation and the universal application of\nthe principle that what is not a final order must\nbe an interlocutory order is neither warranted\nnor justified. If it were so it will render almost\nnugatory the revisional power of the Sessions\nCourt or the High Court conferred on it by\nSection 397(1). On such a strict interpretation,\nonly those orders would be revisable which are\norders passed on the final determination of the\naction but are not appealable under Chapter\nXXIX of the Code. This does not seem to be the\nintention of the Legislature when it retained the\nrevisional power of the High Court in terms\nidentical to the one in the 1898 Code. In what\n\n                        18\n\f          cases then the High Court will examine the\n          legality or the propriety of an order or the\n          legality of any proceeding of an inferior criminal\n          court? Is it circumscribed to examine only such\n          proceeding which is brought for its examination\n          after the final determination and wherein no\n          appeal lies? Such cases will be very few and far\n          between.         …………….\n\n          …There may be an order passed during the\n          course of a proceeding which may not be final\n          in the sense noticed in Kuppuswami case, but,\n          yet it may not be an interlocutory order — pure\n          or simple. Some kinds of order may fall in\n          between the two. By a rule of harmonious\n          construction, we think that the bar in sub-\n          section (2) of Section 397 is not meant to be\n          attracted to such kinds of intermediate\n          orders……”\n\n18.   Referring to the judgment in Mohanlal Maganlal Thacker        v.\n\nState of Gujarat 15, it was held that the test adopted therein that if\n\nreversal of impugned order results in conclusion of proceedings, such\n\norder may not be interlocutory but final order. It was observed :\n\n          “15. …….In the majority decision four tests were\n          culled out from some English decisions. They are\n          found enumerated at p. 688. One of the tests is\n          “if the order in question is reversed would the\n          action have to go on?” Applying that test to the\n          facts of the instant case it would be noticed\n          that if the plea of the appellant succeeds and\n\n15\n                      (1968) 2 SCR 685 = AIR 1968 SC 733\n\n                                         19\n\f            the order of the Sessions Judge is reversed, the\n            criminal proceeding as initiated and instituted\n            against him cannot go on. If, however, he loses\n            on the merits of the preliminary point the\n            proceeding will go on. Applying the test of\n            Kuppuswami case such an order will not be a\n            final order. But applying the fourth test noted at\n            p. 688 in Mohan Lal case it would be a final\n            order. The real point of distinction, however, is to\n            be found at p. 693 in the judgment of Shelat, J.\n            The passage runs thus:\n                 “As observed in Ramesh v. Gendalal\n                 Motilal Patni[(1966) 3 SCR 198 : AIR 1966\n                 SC 1445] the finality of that order was\n                 not to be judged by co-relating that\n                 order with the controversy in the\n                 complaint viz. whether the appellant\n                 had committed the offence charged\n                 against him therein. The fact that that\n                 controversy still remained alive is\n                 irrelevant.”\n\n19.   The principles laid down in Madhu Limaye (supra) still hold the\n\nfield and have not been in any manner diluted by decision of four\n\nJudges in V.C. Shukla versus State through CBI16 or by recent three\n\nJudge Bench decision in Girish Kumar Suneja versus Central Bureau\n\nof Investigation 17 .   Though in V.C. Shukla (supra), order framing\n\ncharge was held to be interlocutory order, judgment in Madhu\n\n\n\n16\n                        (1980) Supp. SCC 92\n17\n                        (2017) 14 SCC 809\n\n                                              20\n\fLimaye      (supra) taking a contrary view was distinguished in the\n\ncontext of the statute considered therein.                     The view in S.\n\nKuppuswami Rao (supra), was held to have been endorsed in\n\nMohanlal Maganlal Thacker               (supra) though factually in       Madhu\n\nLimaye (supra), the said view was explained differently, as already\n\nnoted.      Thus, in spite of the fact that V.C. Shukla (supra) is a\n\njudgment by Bench of            four Judges, it cannot be held that the\n\nprinciple of Madhu Limaye              (supra) does not hold the field.        As\n\nregards Girish Kumar Suneja (supra), which is by a Bench of three\n\nJudges, the issue considered was whether order of this Court\n\ndirecting    that   no     Court       other     than   this   Court   will   stay\n\ninvestigation/trial in Manohar Lal Sharma versus Principal Secretary\n\nand ors. 18 [Coal Block allocation cases] violated right or remedies of\n\nthe affected parties against an order framing charge. It was\n\nobserved that the order framing charge being interlocutory order,\n\nthe same could not be interfered with under Section 397(2) nor\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_57\">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. 19                It was further held that stay of\n\n\n\n18\n                         (2014) 9 SCC 516\n19\n                         Paras 24,25, 27\n\n                                            21\n\fproceedings could not be granted in <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_58\">PC Act</a> cases even under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_59\">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. 20   It was further observed that though power\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1331149/\" id=\"a_60\">Article 227</a> is extremely vast, the same cannot be exercised on\n\nthe drop of a hat as held in Shalini Shyam Shetty versus Rajendra\n\nShankar Patil21 as under :\n\n\n            “37. … This reserve and exceptional power of\n           judicial intervention is not to be exercised just for\n           grant of relief in individual cases but should be\n           directed for promotion of public confidence in\n           the administration of justice in the larger public\n           interest whereas <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_61\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution is\n           meant for protection of individual grievance.\n           Therefore, the power under <a href=\"/doc/1331149/\" id=\"a_62\">Article 227</a> may be\n           unfettered but its exercise is subject to high\n           degree of judicial discipline pointed out\n           above.”\n\n20.   It was observed that power under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_63\">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. could be\n\nexercised only in rarest of rare cases and not otherwise.\n\n           38. The <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_64\">Criminal Procedure Code</a> is undoubtedly\n           a complete code in itself. As has already been\n           discussed by us, the discretionary jurisdiction\n           under <a href=\"/doc/1846048/\" id=\"a_65\">Section 397(2)</a> CrPC is to be exercised\n           only in respect of final orders and intermediate\n           orders. The power under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_66\">Section 482</a> CrPC is to\n           be exercised only in respect of interlocutory\n\n\n20\n                      Para 32\n21\n                      (2010) 8 SCC 329\n\n                                         22\n\f           orders to give effect to an order passed under\n           the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_67\">Criminal Procedure Code</a> or to prevent\n           abuse of the process of any court or otherwise\n           to serve the ends of justice. As indicated above,\n           this power has to be exercised only in the rarest\n           of rare cases and not otherwise. If that is the\n           position, and we are of the view that it is so,\n           resort to <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_68\">Articles 226</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1331149/\" id=\"a_69\">227</a> of the Constitution\n           would be permissible perhaps only in the most\n           extraordinary case. To invoke the constitutional\n           jurisdiction of the High Court when the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_70\">Criminal\n           Procedure Code</a> restricts it in the interest of a\n           fair and expeditious trial for the benefit of the\n           accused person, we find it difficult to accept the\n           proposition that since <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_71\">Articles 226</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1331149/\" id=\"a_72\">227</a> of the\n           Constitution are available to an accused\n           person, these provisions should be resorted to in\n           cases that are not the rarest of rare but for trifling\n           issues.\n\n21.   Reliance was also placed on judgment by seven Judge Bench\n\nin Kartar Singh versus State of Punjab 22 laying down as follows :\n\n           “40. …If the High Courts entertain bail\n           applications    invoking    their   extraordinary\n           jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_73\">Article 226</a> and pass orders,\n           then the very scheme and object of the Act and\n           the intendment of Parliament would be\n           completely defeated and frustrated. But at the\n           same time it cannot be said that the High\n           Courts have no jurisdiction. Therefore, we totally\n           agree with the view taken by this Court in Abdul\n           Hamid Haji Mohammed [(1994) 2 SCC 664] that\n           if the High Court is inclined to entertain any\n\n22\n                       (1994) 3 SCC 569\n\n                                          23\n\f           application under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_74\">Article 226</a>, that power should\n           be exercised most sparingly and only in rare\n           and      appropriate    cases        in   extreme\n           circumstances. What those rare cases are and\n           what would be the circumstances that would\n           justify the entertaining of applications under\n           <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_75\">Article 226</a> cannot be put in straitjacket.”\n\n\n22.   It was further observed that no stay could be granted in <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_76\">PC Act</a>\n\ncases in view of bar contained in <a href=\"/doc/1457437/\" id=\"a_77\">Section 19(3)(c)</a>.        The relevant\n\nobservations are :\n\n           “64. A reading of <a href=\"/doc/181/\" id=\"a_78\">Section 19(3)</a> of the PC Act\n           indicates that it deals with three situations: (i)\n           Clause (a) deals a situation where a final\n           judgment and sentence has been delivered by\n           the Special Judge. We are not concerned with\n           this situation. (ii) Clause (b) deals with a stay of\n           proceedings under the <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_79\">PC Act</a> in the event of\n           any error, omission or irregularity in the grant of\n           sanction by the authority concerned to\n           prosecute the accused person. It is made clear\n           that no court shall grant a stay of proceedings\n           on such a ground except if the court is satisfied\n           that the error, omission or irregularity has\n           resulted in a failure of justice—then and only\n           then can the court grant a stay of proceedings\n           under the <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_80\">PC Act</a>. (iii) Clause (c) provides for a\n           blanket prohibition against a stay of\n           proceedings under the <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_81\">PC Act</a> even if there is a\n           failure of justice [subject of course to Clause\n           (b)]. It mandates that no court shall stay\n           proceedings “on any other ground” that is to\n           say any ground other than a ground relatable\n\n                                   24\n\f           to the error, omission or irregularity in the\n           sanction resulting in a failure of justice.\n\n           65. A conjoint reading of clause (b) and clause\n           (c) of <a href=\"/doc/181/\" id=\"a_82\">Section 19(3)</a> of the PC Act makes it is\n           clear that a stay of proceedings could be\n           granted only and only if there is an error,\n           omission or irregularity in the sanction granted\n           for a prosecution and that error, omission or\n           irregularity has resulted in a failure of justice.\n           There is no other situation that is contemplated\n           for the grant of a stay of proceedings under the\n           <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_83\">PC Act</a> on any other ground whatsoever, even if\n           there is a failure of justice. Clause (c)\n           additionally mandates a prohibition on the\n           exercise of revision jurisdiction in respect of any\n           interlocutory order passed in any trial such as\n           those that we have already referred to. In our\n           opinion, the provisions of clauses (b) and (c) of\n           <a href=\"/doc/181/\" id=\"a_84\">Section 19(3)</a> of the PC Act read together are\n           quite clear and do not admit of any ambiguity\n           or the need for any further interpretation.”\n\n\n23.   We may also refer to the observations of the Constitution Bench\n\nin Ratilal Bhanji Mithani versus Asstt. Collector of Customs, Bombay\n\nand Anr.23 about the nature of inherent power of the High Court:\n\n          “The inherent powers of the High Court preserved\n          by <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_85\">Section 561-A</a> of the Code of Criminal\n          Procedure are thus vested in it by &quot;law&quot; within the\n          meaning of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_86\">Art. 21.</a> The procedure for invoking the\n          inherent powers is regulated by rules framed by\n\n23\n                      [1967] 3 SCR 926\n\n                                         25\n\f          the High Court. The power to make such rules is\n          conferred on the High Court by the Constitution.\n          The rules previously in force were contained in\n          force by <a href=\"/doc/74529/\" id=\"a_87\">Article 372</a> of the Constitution.”\n\n\n24.   As rightly noted in the impugned judgment, a Bench of seven\n\nJudges in L.Chandra Kumar (supra) held that power of the High\n\nCourt to exercise jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1331149/\" id=\"a_88\">Article 227</a> was part of the basic\n\nstructure of the Constitution.\n\n25.   Thus, even though in dealing with different situations, seemingly\n\nconflicting observations may have been made while holding that\n\nthe order framing charge was interlocutory order and was not liable\n\nto be interfered with under Section 397(2) or even under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_89\">Section 482</a>\n\nCr.P.C., the principle laid down in Madhu Limaye (supra) still holds\n\nthe field. Order framing charge may not be held to be purely a\n\ninterlocutory order and can in a given situation be interfered with\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1846048/\" id=\"a_90\">Section 397(2)</a> Cr.P.C. or 482 <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_91\">Cr.P.C</a>. or <a href=\"/doc/1331149/\" id=\"a_92\">Article 227</a> of the\n\nConstitution which is a constitutional provision but the power of the\n\nHigh Court to interfere with an order framing charge and to grant\n\nstay is to be exercised only in an exceptional situation.\n\n\n\n                                   26\n\f26.   We have thus no hesitation in concluding that the High Court\n\nhas jurisdiction in appropriate case to consider the challenge\n\nagainst an order framing charge and also to grant stay but how\n\nsuch power is to be exercised and when stay ought to be granted\n\nneeds to be considered further.\n\n27.   As observed in Girish Kumar Suneja (supra) in the <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_93\">PC Act</a> cases,\n\nthe intention of legislature is expeditious conclusion of trial on day-to-\n\nday basis without any impediment through the stay of proceedings\n\nand this concern must be respected.          This Court also noted the\n\nproviso to <a href=\"/doc/1632932/\" id=\"a_94\">Section 397(1)</a> Cr.P.C. added by <a href=\"/doc/889478/\" id=\"a_95\">Section 22(d)</a> of the PC\n\nAct that a revisional court shall not ordinarily call for the record of\n\nproceedings. If record is called, the Special Judge may not be able\n\nto proceed with the trial which will stand indirectly stayed. The right\n\nof the accused has to be considered vis-à-vis the interest of the\n\nsociety.   As already noted, the bench of seven Judges in Kartar\n\nSingh (supra) held that even constitutional power of the High Court\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_96\">Article 226</a> which was very wide ought to be used with\n\ncircumspection in accordance with judicial consideration and well\n\n\n\n                                    27\n\festablished principles. The power should be exercised sparingly in\n\nrare and extreme circumstances.\n\n\n28.     It is well accepted that delay in a criminal trial, particularly in\n\nthe <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_97\">PC Act</a> cases, has deleterious effect on the administration of\n\njustice in which the society has a vital interest. Delay in trials affects\n\nthe faith in Rule of Law and efficacy of the legal system. It affects\n\nsocial welfare and development. Even in civil or tax cases it has\n\nbeen laid down that power to grant stay has to be exercised with\n\nrestraint. Mere prima facie case is not enough. Party seeking stay\n\nmust be put to terms and stay should not be incentive to delay. The\n\norder granting stay must show application of mind. The power to\n\ngrant stay is coupled with accountability 24.\n\n30.     Wherever stay is granted, a speaking order must be passed\n\nshowing that the case was of exceptional nature and delay on\n\naccount of stay will not prejudice the interest of speedy trial in a\n\n\n\n\n24\n                                    Siliguri Municipality vs. Amalendu Das (1984) 2 SCC 436 para 4; Assistant\nCollector of Central Excise, Chandan Nagar, West Bengal vs. Dunlop India Ltd. and Ors. (1985) 1 SCC 260 para 5;\nUnion Territory of Pondicherry and Ors. vs. P.V. Suresh and Ors. (1994) 2 SCC 70 para 15; and State of West\nBengal and Ors. vs. Calcutta Hardware Stores and Ors. (1986) 2 SCC 203 para 5\n\n                                                      28\n\fcorruption case. Once stay is granted, proceedings should not be\n\nadjourned and concluded within two-three months.\n\n31.   The wisdom of legislature and the object of final and\n\nexpeditious disposal of a criminal proceeding cannot be ignored. In\n\nexercise of its power the High Court is to balance the freedom of an\n\nindividual on the one hand and security of the society on the other.\n\nOnly in case of patent illegality or want of jurisdiction the High Court\n\nmay exercise its jurisdiction. The acknowledged experience is that\n\nwhere challenge to an order framing charge is entertained, the\n\nmatter remains pending for long time which defeats the interest of\n\njustice.\n\n\n\n32.   We have already quoted the judicial experience as noted in\n\nthe earlier judgments in Para 9 above that trial of corruption cases is\n\nnot permitted to proceed on account of challenge to the order of\n\ncharge before the High Courts. Once stay is granted, disposal of a\n\npetition before the High Court takes long time. Consideration of the\n\nchallenge against an order of framing charge may not require\n\nmeticulous examination of voluminous material which may be in the\n\n                                   29\n\fnature of a mini trial. Still, the Court is at times called upon to do so\n\ninspite of law being clear that at the stage of charge the Court has\n\nonly to see as to whether material on record reasonably connects\n\nthe accused with the crime.              Constitution Bench of this Court in\n\nHardeep Singh versus State of Punjab 25 observed :\n\n\n\n\n         100. However, there is a series of cases wherein\n         this Court while dealing with the provisions of\n         <a href=\"/doc/1056165/\" id=\"a_98\">Sections 227</a>, <a href=\"/doc/411062/\" id=\"a_99\">228</a>, <a href=\"/doc/897083/\" id=\"a_100\">239</a>, <a href=\"/doc/150946/\" id=\"a_101\">240</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1770169/\" id=\"a_102\">241</a>, <a href=\"/doc/542711/\" id=\"a_103\">242</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1568411/\" id=\"a_104\">245</a>\n         CrPC, has consistently held that the court at the\n         stage of framing of the charge has to apply its mind\n         to the question whether or not there is any ground\n         for presuming the commission of an offence by the\n         accused. The court has to see as to whether the\n         material brought on record reasonably connect the\n         accused with the offence. Nothing more is required\n         to be enquired into. While dealing with the\n         aforesaid provisions, the test of prima facie case is\n         to be applied. The court has to find out whether the\n         materials offered by the prosecution to be adduced\n         as evidence are sufficient for the court to proceed\n         against the accused further. (Vide State of\n         Karnataka v. L. Muniswamy[(1977) 2 SCC 699], All\n         India Bank Officers’ Confederation v. Union of\n         India[(1989) 4 SCC 90] Stree Atyachar Virodhi\n         Parishad v. Dilip Nathumal Chordia [(1989) 1 SCC\n         715] State of M.P. v.

State of\nMaharashtra [(2002) 2 SCC 135] this Court while\ndealing with the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1056165/\" id=\"a_105\">Sections 227</a> and <a href=\"/doc/411062/\" id=\"a_106\">228</a>\nCrPC, placed a very heavy reliance on the earlier\njudgment of this Court in Union of India v. Prafulla\nKumar Samal [(1979) 3 SCC 4] and held that while\nconsidering the question of framing the charges,\nthe court may weigh the evidence for the limited\npurpose of finding out whether or not a prima facie\ncase against the accused has been made out and\nwhether the materials placed before the court\ndisclose grave suspicion against the accused which\nhas not been properly explained. In such an\neventuality, the court is justified in framing the\ncharges and proceeding with the trial. The court\nhas to consider the broad probabilities of the case,\nthe total effect of the evidence and the documents\nproduced before the court but the court should not\nmake a roving enquiry into the pros and cons of the\nmatter and weigh evidence as if it is conducting a\ntrial.\n102. In Suresh v. State of Maharashtra[(2001) 3\nSCC 703], this Court after taking note of the earlier\njudgments in Niranjan Singh Karam Singh Punjabi\nv. Jitendra Bhimraj Bijjaya[(1990) 4 SCC 76] and\nState    of    Maharashtra     v.    Priya   Sharan\nMaharaj[(1997) 4 SCC 393], held as under:\n(Suresh case, SCC p. 707, para 9)\n\n      “9. … at the stage of Sections 227 and\n      228 the court is required to evaluate the\n      material and documents on record with\n      a view to finding out if the facts\n      emerging therefrom taken at their face\n      value disclose the existence of all the\n      ingredients constituting the alleged\n      offence. The court may, for this limited\n      purpose, sift the evidence as it cannot\n      be expected even at that initial stage to\n      accept all that the prosecution states as\n      the gospel truth even if it is opposed to\n      common sense or the broad probabilities\n      of the case. Therefore, at the stage of\n      framing of the charge the court has to\n                           31\n\f                  consider the material with a view to find\n                  out if there is ground **for presuming\n                  that the accused has committed the\n                  offence** or that there is not sufficient\n                  ground for proceeding against him\n                  and** not for the purpose of arriving at\n                  the conclusion that it is not likely to lead\n                  to a conviction**. (Priya Sharan case,\n                  SCC p. 397, para 8)”\n                                    (emphasis in original)\n            103. Similarly in State of Bihar v. Ramesh\n            Singh[(1997) 4 SCC 39], while dealing with the\n            issue, this Court held: (SCC p. 42, para 4)\n\n                 “4. … If the evidence which the\n                 prosecutor proposes to adduce to prove\n                 the guilt of the accused even if fully\n                 accepted before it is challenged in cross-\n                 examination or rebutted by the defence\n                 evidence, if any, cannot show that the\n                 accused committed the offence, then\n                 there will be no sufficient ground for\n                 proceeding with the trial.”\n\n33.   If contrary to the above law, at the stage of charge, the High\n\nCourt adopts the approach of weighing probabilities and re-\n\nappreciate the material,        it may be certainly a time consuming\n\nexercise.      The legislative policy of expeditious final disposal of the\n\ntrial is thus, hampered. Thus, even while reiterating the view that\n\nthere is no bar to jurisdiction of the High Court to consider a\n\nchallenge against an order of framing charge in exceptional\n\nsituation for correcting a patent error of lack of jurisdiction, exercise\n\n                                      32\n\fof such jurisdiction has to be limited to rarest of rare cases.     Even if\n\na challenge to order framing         charge is entertained, decision of\n\nsuch a petition should not be delayed. Though no mandatory time\n\nlimit can be fixed, normally it should not exceed two-three months.\n\nIf stay is granted, it should not normally be unconditional or of\n\nindefinite duration. Appropriate conditions may be imposed so that\n\nthe party in whose favour stay is granted is accountable if court\n\nfinally finds no merit in the matter and the other side suffers loss and\n\ninjustice. To give effect to the legislative policy and the mandate of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_107\">Article 21</a> for speedy justice in criminal cases,       if stay is granted,\n\nmatter should be taken on day-to-day basis and concluded within\n\ntwo-three months. Where the matter remains pending for longer\n\nperiod, the order of stay will stand vacated on expiry of six months,\n\nunless   extension   is   granted   by    a   speaking    order   showing\n\nextraordinary situation where continuing stay was to be preferred to\n\nthe final disposal of trial by the trial Court. This timeline is being fixed\n\nin view of the fact that such trials are expected to be concluded\n\nnormally in one to two years.\n\n\n\n                                     33\n\f34.   In Imtiaz Ahmad        versus       State of U.P. 26 this Court after\n\nconsidering a report noted:\n\n             “(a) As high as 9% of the cases have\n             completed more than twenty years since the\n             date of stay order.\n             (b) Roughly 21% of the cases have completed\n             more than ten years.\n             (c) Average pendency per case (counted\n             from the date of stay order till 26-7-2010) works\n             out to be around 7.4 years.\n             (d) Charge-sheet was found to be the most\n             prominent stage where the cases were stayed\n             with almost 32% of the cases falling under this\n             category. The next two prominent stages are\n             found to be ‘appearance’ and ‘summons’,\n             with each comprising 19% of the total number\n             of cases. If ‘appearance’ and ‘summons’ are\n             considered interchangeable, then they would\n             collectively account for the maximum of stay\n             orders.”\n\n\n\n      After noting the above scenario, the Court directed :\n\n\n             “55. Certain directions are given to the High\n             Courts for better maintenance of the rule of\n             law and better administration of justice:\n\n                While analysing the data in aggregated\n             form, this Court cannot overlook the most\n             important factor in the administration of\n\n26\n                      (2012) 2 SCC 688\n\n                                         34\n\fjustice. The authority of the High Court to order\nstay of investigation pursuant to lodging of FIR,\nor trial in deserving cases is unquestionable. But\nthis Court is of the view that the exercise of this\nauthority carries with it the responsibility to\nexpeditiously dispose of the case. The power\nto grant stay of investigation and trial is a very\nextraordinary power given to the High Courts\nand the same power is to be exercised\nsparingly only to prevent an abuse of the\nprocess and to promote the ends of justice. It is\ntherefore clear that:\n\n(i) Such an extraordinary power has to be\nexercised    with    due    caution   and\ncircumspection.\n\n(ii) Once such a power is exercised, the High\nCourt should not lose sight of the case where it\nhas exercised its extraordinary power of\nstaying investigation and trial.\n\n(iii) The High Court should make it a point of\nfinally disposing of such proceedings as early\nas possible but preferably within six months\nfrom the date the stay order is issued.\n\n56. It is true that this Court has no power of\nsuperintendence over the High Court as the\nHigh Court has over District Courts under\n<a href=\"/doc/1331149/\" id=\"a_108\">Article 227</a> of the Constitution. Like this Court,\nthe High Court is equally a superior court of\nrecord with plenary jurisdiction. Under our\nConstitution the High Court is not a court\nsubordinate to this Court. This Court, however,\nenjoys appellate powers over the High Court\nas also some other incidental powers. But as\nthe last court and in exercise of this Court’s\npower to do complete justice which includes\n\n                       35\n\f             within it the power to improve the\n             administration of justice in public interest, this\n             Court gives the aforesaid guidelines for\n             sustaining common man’s faith in the rule of\n             law and the justice delivery system, both being\n             inextricably linked.”\n\n\n\n\n35.   In view of above, situation of proceedings remaining pending\n\nfor long on account of stay needs to be remedied.                 Remedy is\n\nrequired not only for corruption cases but for all civil and criminal\n\ncases where on account of stay, civil and criminal proceedings are\n\nheld up. At times, proceedings are adjourned sine die on account\n\nof stay. Even after stay is vacated, intimation is not received and\n\nproceedings are not taken up.            In an attempt to remedy this,\n\nsituation, we consider it appropriate to direct that in all pending\n\ncases where stay against proceedings of a civil or criminal trial is\n\noperating, the same will come to an end on expiry of six months from\n\ntoday unless in an exceptional case by a speaking order such stay is\n\nextended.    In cases where stay is granted in future, the same will\n\nend on expiry of six months from the date of such order unless similar\n\nextension is granted by a speaking order. The speaking order must\n\nshow that the case was of such exceptional nature that continuing\n                                    36\n\fthe stay was more important than having the trial finalized. The trial\n\nCourt where order of stay of civil or criminal proceedings is\n\nproduced, may fix a date not beyond six months of the order of stay\n\nso that on expiry of period of stay, proceedings can commence\n\nunless order of extension of stay is produced.\n\n\n\n\n36.   Thus, we declare the law to be that order framing charge is not\n\npurely an interlocutory order nor a final order. Jurisdiction of the High\n\nCourt is not barred irrespective of the label of a petition, be it under\n\nSections 397 or 482 <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_109\">Cr.P.C</a>. or <a href=\"/doc/1331149/\" id=\"a_110\">Article 227</a> of the Constitution.\n\nHowever, the said jurisdiction is to be exercised consistent with the\n\nlegislative policy to ensure expeditious disposal of a trial without the\n\nsame being in any manner hampered.               Thus considered, the\n\nchallenge to an order of charge should be entertained in a rarest of\n\nrare case only to correct a patent error of jurisdiction and not to re-\n\nappreciate the matter. Even where such challenge is entertained\n\nand stay is granted, the matter must be decided on day-to-day\n\nbasis so that stay does not operate for an unduly long period.\n\nThough no mandatory time limit may be fixed, the decision may not\n\n                                   37\n\fexceed two-three months normally.       If it remains pending longer,\n\nduration of stay should not exceed six months, unless extension is\n\ngranted by a specific speaking order, as already indicated.\n\nMandate of speedy justice applies to the <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_111\">PC Act</a> cases as well as\n\nother cases where at trial stage proceedings are stayed by the\n\nhigher court i.e. the High Court or a court below the High Court, as\n\nthe case may be. In all pending matters before the High Courts or\n\nother courts relating to <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_112\">PC Act</a> or all other civil or criminal cases,\n\nwhere stay of proceedings in a pending trial is operating, stay will\n\nautomatically lapse after six months from today unless extended by\n\na speaking order on above parameters. Same course may also be\n\nadopted by civil and criminal appellate/revisional courts under the\n\njurisdiction of the High Courts.   The trial courts may, on expiry of\n\nabove period, resume the proceedings without waiting for any other\n\nintimation unless express order extending stay is produced.\n\n\n\n\n37.   The High Courts may also issue instructions to this effect and\n\nmonitor the same so that civil or criminal proceedings do not remain\n\npending for unduly period at the trial stage.\n\n                                   38\n\f38.

Even    before\n\nindependence, these provisions were found to be inadequate to\n\ndeal with the rapid onset of this disease as a result of which the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/33237157/\" id=\"a_113\">Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947</a>, was enacted. <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_114\">This Act</a> was\n\namended twice – once by the <a href=\"/doc/544006/\" id=\"a_115\">Criminal Law (Amendment) Act,\n\n1952</a> and a second time by the <a href=\"/doc/506831/\" id=\"a_116\">Anti-Corruption Laws\n\n(Amendment) Act, 1964</a>, based on the recommendations of the\n\nSanthanam Committee. A working of the 1947 Act showed that\n\nit was found to be inadequate to deal with the disease of\n\ncorruption effectively enough. For this reason, the <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_117\">Prevention\n\nof Corruption Act, 1988</a> was enacted (hereinafter referred to as\n\n“the Act”).

There are provisions in\n      Chapter IX of the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_119\">Indian Penal Code</a> to deal with\n      public servants and those who abet them by way of\n      criminal misconduct. There are also provisions in\n      the Criminal Law Amendment Ordinance, 1944, to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                                                     4</span>\n\f     enable attachment of ill-gotten wealth obtained\n     through corrupt means, including from transferees\n     of such wealth.

In order to expedite the proceedings,\n     provisions for day-to-day trial of cases and\n     prohibitory provisions with regard to grant of stay\n     and exercise of powers of revision on interlocutory\n     orders have also been included.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_6\">     4.    Since the provisions of Sections 161 to 165-A\n     are incorporated in the proposed legislation with an\n     enhanced punishment, it is not necessary to retain\n     those sections in the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_122\">Indian Penal Code</a>.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_7\">     Consequently, it is proposed to delete those\n     sections with the necessary saving provision.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_8\">     5.

Also, in <a href=\"/doc/1595656/\" id=\"a_189\">Ratilal Bhanji Mithani v. Assistant Collector of\n\nCustoms</a>, 1967 SCR (3) 926 at 930-931, this Court had\n\noccasion to deal with the inherent power of the High Court\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_190\">Section 561-A</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898,\n\nwhich is equivalent to <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_191\">Section 482</a> of the Code of Criminal\n\nProcedure, 1973.     It was held that the said Section did not\n\nconfer any power, but only declared that nothing in the Code\n\nshall be deemed to limit or affect the existing inherent powers of\n\nthe High Court. The Court then went on to hold:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">      “The proviso to the article is not material and need\n      not be read. The article enacts that the jurisdiction\n      of the existing High Courts and the powers of the\n      judges thereof in relation to administration of justice\n      “shall be” the same as immediately before the\n      commencement         of   the    Constitution.     The\n      Constitution confirmed and re-vested in the High\n      Court all its existing powers and jurisdiction\n      including its inherent powers, and its power to make\n      rules. When the Constitution or any enacted law has\n      embraced and confirmed the inherent powers and\n      jurisdiction of the High Court which previously\n      existed, that power and jurisdiction has the sanction\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                                                                     19</span>\n\f      of an enacted “law” within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_192\">Art. 21</a> as\n      explained in A.

The procedure for invoking the inherent powers\n      is regulated by rules framed by the High Court. The\n      power to make such rules is conferred on the High\n      Court by the Constitution. The rules previously in\n      force were continued in force by <a href=\"/doc/74529/\" id=\"a_194\">Article 372</a> of the\n      Constitution. The order of the High Court canceling\n      the bail and depriving the appellant of his personal\n      liberty is according to procedure established by law\n      and is not violative of Art. 21.”\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_40\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1689510\" id=\"span_23\">11.   It is thus clear that the inherent power of a Court set up by\n\nthe Constitution is a power that inheres in such Court because\n\nit is a superior court of record, and not because it is conferred\n\nby the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_195\">Code of Criminal Procedure</a>. This is a power vested by\n\nthe Constitution itself, inter alia, under <a href=\"/doc/207538/\" id=\"a_196\">Article 215</a> as\n\naforestated. Also, as such High Courts have the power, nay,\n\nthe duty to protect the fundamental rights of citizens under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_197\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution, the inherent power to do justice\n\nin cases involving the liberty of the citizen would also sound in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_198\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.    This being the constitutional\n\nposition, it is clear that <a href=\"/doc/1457437/\" id=\"a_199\">Section 19(3)(c)</a> cannot be read as a\n\nban on the maintainability of a petition filed before the High\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                                                                      20</span>\n\fCourt under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_200\">Section 482</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the\n\nnon-obstante clause in <a href=\"/doc/181/\" id=\"a_201\">Section 19(3)</a> applying only to the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_202\">Code\n\nof Criminal Procedure</a>. The judgment of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1689510/\" id=\"a_203\">Satya\n\nNarayan Sharma v. State of Rajasthan</a>, (2001) 8 SCC 607 at\n\nparagraphs 14 and 15 does not, therefore, lay down the correct\n\nposition in law. Equally, in paragraph 17 of <a href=\"/doc/1689510/\" id=\"a_204\">the said judgment</a>,\n\ndespite the clarification that proceedings can be “adapted” in\n\nappropriate cases, the Court went on to hold that there is a\n\nblanket ban of stay of trials and that, therefore, Section 482,\n\neven as adapted, cannot be used for the aforesaid purpose.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\">This again is contrary to the position in law as laid down\n\nhereinabove.

At this juncture it is important to consider the 3-Judge\n\nbench decision in <a href=\"/doc/646292/\" id=\"a_205\">Madhu Limaye</a> (supra).

As pointed out in <a href=\"/doc/1546207/\" id=\"a_212\">Amar Nath</a> case the purpose\n     of putting a bar on the power of revision in relation\n     to any interlocutory order passed in an appeal,\n     inquiry, trial or other proceeding, is to bring about\n     expeditious disposal of the cases finally. More often\n     than not, the revisional power of the High Court was\n     resorted to in relation to interlocutory orders\n     delaying the final disposal of the proceedings. The\n     Legislature in its wisdom decided to check this\n     delay by introducing sub-section (2) in Section 397.\n     On the one hand, a bar has been put in the way of\n     the High Court (as also of the Sessions Judge) for\n     exercise of the revisional power in relation to any\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                                                                 22</span>\n\finterlocutory order, on the other, the power has\nbeen conferred in almost the same terms as it was\nin the 1898 Code. On a plain reading of Section\n482, however, it would follow that nothing in the\nCode, which would include sub-section (2) of\nSection 397 also, “shall be deemed to limit or affect\nthe inherent powers of the High Court”, But, if we\nwere to say that the said bar is not to operate in the\nexercise of the inherent power at all, it will be setting\nat naught one of the limitations imposed upon the\nexercise of the revisional powers. In such a\nsituation, what is the harmonious way out? In our\nopinion, a happy solution of this problem would be\nto say that the bar provided in sub-section (2) of\nSection 397 operates only in exercise of the\nrevisional power of the High Court, meaning thereby\nthat the High Court will have no power of revision in\nrelation to any interlocutory order. Then in\naccordance with one of the other principles\nenunciated above, the inherent power will come into\nplay, there being no other provision in the Code for\nthe redress of the grievance of the aggrieved party.\nBut then, if the order assailed is purely of an\ninterlocutory character which could be corrected in\nexercise of the revisional power of the High Court\nunder the 1898 Code, the High Court will refuse to\nexercise its inherent power. But in case the\nimpugned order clearly brings about a situation\nwhich is an abuse of the process of the Court or for\nthe purpose of securing the ends of justice\ninterference by the High Court is absolutely\nnecessary, then nothing contained in Section 397(2)\ncan limit or affect the exercise of the inherent power\nby the High Court. But such cases would be few\nand far between. The High Court must exercise the\ninherent power very sparingly. One such case\nwould be the desirability of the quashing of a\ncriminal proceeding initiated illegally, vexatiously or\nas being without jurisdiction. Take for example a\ncase where a prosecution is launched under the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">                                                            23</span>\n\f      <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_213\">Prevention of Corruption Act</a> without a sanction,\n      then the trial of the accused will be without\n      jurisdiction and even after his acquittal a second\n      trial, after proper sanction will not be barred on the\n      doctrine of autrefois acquit. Even assuming,\n      although we shall presently show that it is not so,\n      that in such a case an order of the Court taking\n      cognizance or issuing processes is an interlocutory\n      order, does it stand to reason to say that inherent\n      power of the High Court cannot be exercised for\n      stopping the criminal proceeding as early as\n      possible, instead of harassing the accused up to the\n      end? The answer is obvious that the bar will not\n      operate to prevent the abuse of the process of the\n      Court and/or to secure the ends of justice. The label\n      of the petition filed by an aggrieved party is\n      immaterial. The High Court can examine the matter\n      in an appropriate case under its inherent powers.\n      The present case undoubtedly falls for exercise of\n      the power of the High Court in accordance with\n      Section 482 of the 1973 Code, even assuming,\n      although not accepting, that invoking the revisional\n      power of the High Court is impermissible.</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">                                          (at pages 555-556)\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1546207\" id=\"span_32\">13.

As\nheld in Amar Nath and with which conclusion we\nagree, if an interlocutory order is not revisable due\nto the prohibition contained in <a href=\"/doc/1846048/\" id=\"a_243\">Section 397(2)</a> of the\nCr.P.C. that cannot be circumvented by resort\nto <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_244\">Section 482</a> of the Cr.P.C.

What then is the utility of <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_245\">Section 482</a> CrPC?\nThis was considered and explained in <a href=\"/doc/646292/\" id=\"a_246\">Madhu\nLimaye [Madhu Limaye v. State of Maharashtra</a>,\n(1977) 4 SCC 551 : 1978 SCC (Cri) 10] which\nnoticed the prohibition in <a href=\"/doc/1846048/\" id=\"a_247\">Section 397(2)</a> CrPC and\nat the same time the expansive text of <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_248\">Section 482</a>\nCrPC and posed the question: In such a situation,\nwhat is the harmonious way out? This Court then\nproceeded to answer the question in the following\nmanner: (SCC pp. 555-56, para 10)\n      “10. … In such a situation, what is the\n      harmonious way out? In our opinion, a happy\n      solution of this problem would be to say that\n      the bar provided in sub-section (2) of Section\n      397 operates only in exercise of the revisional\n      power of the High Court, meaning thereby that\n      the High Court will have no power of revision\n      in relation to any interlocutory order. Then in\n      accordance with one of the other principles\n      enunciated above, the inherent power will\n      come into play, there being no other provision\n      in the Code for the redress of the grievance of\n      the aggrieved party. But then, if the order\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">                                                        29</span>\n\f           assailed is purely of an interlocutory character\n           which could be corrected in exercise of the\n           revisional power of the High Court under the\n           1898 Code, the High Court will refuse to\n           exercise its inherent power. But in case the\n           impugned order clearly brings about a\n           situation which is an abuse of the process of\n           the Court or for the purpose of securing the\n           ends of justice interference by the High Court\n           is absolutely necessary, then nothing\n           contained in Section 397(2) can limit or affect\n           the exercise of the inherent power by the High\n           Court. But such cases would be few and far\n           between.</span> The High Court must exercise the\n           inherent power very sparingly.”\n\n      xxx xxx xxx\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_54\">      32. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1689510\" id=\"span_52\">In <a href=\"/doc/1689510/\" id=\"a_249\">Satya Narayan Sharma v.

It was clarified that that does not mean\n      that the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_252\">Section 482</a> of the Cr.P.C.\n      cannot be taken recourse to, but even if a litigant\n      approaches the High Court under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_253\">Section 482</a> of the\n      Cr.P.C. and that petition is entertained, the trial\n      under the <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_254\">PC Act</a> cannot be stayed. The litigant may\n      convince the court to expedite the hearing of the\n      petition filed, but merely because the court is not in\n      a position to grant an early hearing would not be a\n      ground to stay the trial even temporarily. With\n      respect, we do not agree with the proposition that\n      for the purposes of a stay of proceedings recourse\n      could be had to <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_255\">Section 482</a> of the Cr.P.C.

The <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_256\">Criminal Procedure Code</a> is undoubtedly a\n      complete code in itself.

The power under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_258\">Section\n      482</a> of the Cr.P.C. is to be exercised only in respect\n      of interlocutory orders to give effect to an order\n      passed under the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_259\">Cr.P.C</a>. or to prevent abuse of the\n      process of any Court or otherwise to serve the ends\n      of justice. As indicated above, this power has to be\n      exercised only in the rarest of rare cases and not\n      otherwise.
