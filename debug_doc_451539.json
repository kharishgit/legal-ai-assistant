Against \nthe order of acquittal of accused Harbhajan Singh, no appeal was filed by the \nState whereas on appeal being filed by the appellants, the High Court confirmed \ntheir conviction and sentence.   The revision application filed by the private \nprosecutor for enhancement of sentence has been rejected by the High Court. \n\tProsecution case, in short, was that Kuljit Singh @ Billa was a student of \nB.A. Part I in Arya College, Ludhiana and he was a witness in a case filed for \nprosecution of appellant Gurpreet Singh under <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 307</a> IPC which was \npending.  On 22nd January, 1990 at about 5.30 p.m., Kuljit Singh along with his \nbrother Harvinder Singh and friends Parminder Singh (PW 2) and Gurvinder \nSingh (PW 3) was returning to his house after attending classes from Guru \nAngad Dev College and when they reached near Oriental Public School, the \nappellants along with accused Meharban Singh, who were present there armed \nwith kirpans, confronted him.   Appellant Gurpreet Singh shouted that Kuljit Singh \nshould be done to death and he attacked him with kirpan on his head.  \nThereafter, appellant Mohinder Pal Singh @ Vicky  inflicted kirpan blow in the \nabdomen of Kuljit Singh.  Accused Meharban Singh assaulted  him with kirpan \non the temporal region whereupon Kuljit Singh fell down.  In the meantime, \naccused Harbhajan Singh who too was armed with kirpan came there and also \ndealt a kirpan blow on the forehead of Kuljit  \nSingh.  All the aforesaid accused persons thereafter inflicted several injuries \nupon Kuljit Singh even after he fell down.  In the process of inflicting injuries, \nappellant Gurpreet Singh also received injuries at the hands of one of the co-\naccused.  On halla being raised, people of the locality arrived whereafter the \naccused persons fled away.  Kuljit Singh was taken to Christian Medical Hospital \nby PW 3 and Harvinder Singh where the doctor declared him dead.  Thereupon, \nHarvinder Singh, who was brother of Kuljit Singh \u0016 deceased, left for the police \nstation but on the Brown Road, near Christian Medical Hospital, he met Sub \nInspector Bakshish Singh (PW 8) who recorded his statement stating therein the \naforesaid facts and sent the same to the police station where a case was \nregistered against all the aforesaid four accused persons, including the \nappellants on the same day at 7.15 p.m. \n\t Police after registering the case took up investigation and on completion \nthereof submitted charge sheet against the accused persons, on receipt whereof, \nlearned magistrate took cognizance and committed all the aforesaid accused \npersons, including the appellants, to the court of Sessions to face trial.  As \naccused Meharban Singh died during trial, the same proceeded against the \nremaining three accused persons.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">Defence of the accused persons was that they were innocent and were \nfalsely implicated in the case in hand.   Specific defence of the  appellants was \nthat when they were going to the shop of appellant \u0016 Gurpreet Singh  and arrived \nat Jail Road at the time of the present occurrence, Kuljit Singh and his brother \nUpkar Singh were coming from the opposite direction along with one unknown \nperson and out of them, Kuljit Singh asked his companions to kill appellant \nGurpreet Singh whereupon, he was chased and surrounded by Kuljit Singh and \nothers and out of them, Upkar Singh stabbed Gurpreet Singh with his knife.  In \nthe meantime, upon halla being raised by appellant Gurpreet Singh, villagers \narrived there who assaulted Kuljit Singh and stating the aforesaid facts, a \ncomplaint was filed by appellant Gurpreet Singh on 3rd February, 1990 as \nGurpreet Singh was hospitalized.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">During the course of trial, the prosecution examined eight witnesses in all, \nout of whom, Dr. I.P.Singh Chhabra (PW 1) was the  doctor who conducted \npostmortem examination on dead body of the deceased.   Parminder Singh         \n(PW 2) and Gurvinder Singh (PW 3) claimed to be eyewitnesses to the \noccurrence.    Head Constable Balbir Singh (PW 4) and  Constables Manjit Singh \n(PW 5),  Gurcharan Singh (PW 6) and  Lakhbir Singh (PW 7) were the formal \nwitnesses whereas SI Bakshish Singh (PW 8) was the Investigating Officer.   \nInformant Harvinder Singh could not be examined as he died before the trial \ncommenced. The defence in support of its case examined three witnesses, \nnamely, Dr. Subodh Radian (DW 1), who is said to have examined injuries of \nappellant- Gurpreet Singh, and  Tarsem Singh (DW 2) and E.Rai Singh (DW 3) \nwere formal witnesses.  Upon the conclusion of trial, accused Harbhajan Singh \nwas acquitted whereas the appellants were convicted and their appeal before the \nHigh Court having failed, as stated above, the present appeals by special leave. \n\tIn the present case,  presence of the  appellants at the time and place of \noccurrence has not been denied rather admitted.  Appellant Gurpreet Singh is \nsaid to have been examined by doctor [DW 1] who stated that he found following \ninjury on his person:- \n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">&quot;Penetrating wound on the back of the chest left 8th interracostal \nspace, 5 c.m. from midline, 1-5 c.m. x 0.5 c.m, depth not \nascertained along with left haeopheumethroex.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_5\">\tFrom the dimension of injury, it would appear that the same was superficial \none inasmuch as, according to the doctor, even its depth could not be \nascertained.  The complaint petition was filed by appellant \u0016 Gurpreet Singh on \n3rd February, 1990, i.e., after eleven days of the date of the incident and the \nreason for delay disclosed was  that the said appellant was discharged from \nhospital on 3rd of February, 1990.  The doctor (DW 1)  stated that  appellant \u0016 \nGurpeet Singh remained  conscious throughout, but,  even then, no explanation is \nforthcoming why  complaint was not filed either by this appellant  himself or  any \nof his relations for a period of eleven days  after the occurrence.  It appears that \ninjury was superficial and complaint was filed  after an inordinate delay of eleven \ndays  in order to make out a defence in the present case. \n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_6\">\t Doctor [PW 1],  who held postmortem examination on the dead body of \nKuljit Singh, found following injuries:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">1.\tCurved incised wound 5&quot; x 1&quot; x bone deep on the left side of \nforehead, extending from bridge of the nose to left ear.  \nUnderneath bone was cut i.e. frontal and nasal bone. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">2.\tIncised wound 2&quot; x =&quot; x bone deep on forehead on right \nside. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">3.\tIncised wound 3&quot; x =&quot; x bone deep underneath bone was \ncut on right cheek extending from lateral angle of eye \ntowards ear downward. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">4.\tLacerated wound on parieto occipital on right side 4&quot; x =&quot; x \nscalp deep. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">5.\tIncised wound 2 &gt;&quot; &quot;  x =&quot; x bone deep on upper lip, cut \nand cut through and through and underneath teeth fractured \ni.e. both incisors and canine. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">6.\tAbraded contusion 2&quot; x =&quot; on the top of right shoulder. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">7.\tAbraded contusion on the top of left shoulder 4&quot; x 2&quot;. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">8.\tIncised would 1= x =&quot; x bone deep on the right thumb on \npalmer aspect.

All other organs which have not \nbeen described were healthy. \n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">The doctor stated that the deceased died as a result of cumulative effect of \ninjuries on the lungs and liver and the same were sufficient to cause death in the \nordinary course of nature.   According to him, injury Nos. 4,6, 7, 11, 18 and 19 \ncould have been inflicted by blunt weapon whereas other thirteen injuries by \nincised weapon like kirpan.  So far as injury Nos. 4,6,7,11,18 and 19 are \nconcerned, PW 3 stated during the course of cross-examination that even after \nthe deceased fell down,  he was assaulted by the accused persons and in order \nto protect himself, he was tossing and rolling on the ground.  As such, the \naforesaid injuries he might have received during the course of tossing and rolling \non the ground.  The other injuries were undisputedly caused by kirpan.  Thus, the \nmedical evidence supports the prosecution case that the deceased was assaulted \nby the accused persons with kirpan. \n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_8\">The two eyewitnesses, namely, Parminder Singh (PW 2) and Gurvinder \nSingh (PW 3) have consistently supported the prosecution case in their \nstatements made before the police as well as in Court.  The ground of attack to \ntheir evidence is that neither in the mortuary register nor in the daily diary [Ex. \nDC] their names were disclosed.   In this connection, reference has been made to \n<a href=\"/doc/1980578/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 154</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure (for short &#x27;the Code&#x27;) which lays \ndown that every information relating to the commission of a cognizable offence \nshall be reduced into writing by the police officer incharge of the police station and \nthereafter substance thereof shall be entered in a book to be kept by such officer \nin such form as the State Government may prescribe in this behalf.  Under  Rule \n24.1 of the Punjab Police Rules, Volume III, 1959 Edition, framed by the State \nGovernment, it has been prescribed that  substance of the report shall  be \nentered in the Daily Diary.  The relevant part of the Rule reads as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">&quot;Every information covered by <a href=\"/doc/1980578/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 154</a>, Criminal Procedure \nCode, must be reduced to writing as provided in that section and \nsubstance thereof must be entered in the police station daily diary, \nwhich is the book provided for the purpose.  It is only information \nwhich raises a reasonable suspicion of the commission of a \ncognizable offence within the jurisdiction of the police officer to \nwhom it is given which compels action under <a href=\"/doc/279174/\" id=\"a_7\">section 157</a>, Criminal \nProcedure Code.&quot; \n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">\tIn the present case, as required under the aforesaid Rules, substance of \ninformation received under <a href=\"/doc/1980578/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 154</a> Cr.P.C.  has been entered in the daily \ndiary  which has been marked as Ex.DC wherein names of all the four accused \nand that of the deceased have been mentioned but so far as names of witnesses \nare concerned, the same have not been disclosed.  It may be stated that under \n<a href=\"/doc/1034470/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 154</a> of the Code as well as  Rule 24.1 of the Rules referred to above, \nwhat is required to be mentioned in the daily diary  is substance of the information \nreceived and the same cannot be said to be repository of everything.  Factum of \nmurder of Kuljit Singh by the four accused persons, including the appellants, has \nbeen specifically entered.  If the names of the witnesses have not been \nmentioned, it cannot be said that substance of information received was not \nentered and   there was violation of the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1034470/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 154</a> read with Rule \n24.1 of the Rules .  Mere non-disclosure of the names of witnesses in the  daily \ndiary  as well as mortuary register, ipso facto, cannot affect the prosecution case \nmore so, when their names have been disclosed in the first information report \nitself and there is no other circumstance to  otherwise  create doubt regarding \nveracity of the prosecution case.   This being the position, we do not find any \nground to disbelieve the evidence of PWs 2 and 3.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\">\tMr. Sushil Kumar, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the \nappellant \u0016 Gurpreet Singh submitted that there was inordinate delay in sending \ncopy of the first information report to the learned magistrate as the case was \nregistered on 22nd January, 1990 at 7.15 p.m. but first information report reached \nthe concerned magistrate on that night at 0002 hours.  In this regard, reference \nmay be made to the evidence of constable Lakhbir Singh (PW 7) who stated that \nthe special report of the present case was made over to him at 8.00 p.m. for being \ndelivered to the concerned magistrate and other officers.  He further stated that \nfirst of all, he delivered  copy of the report at the City Control Room, the   \nSuperintendent of Police (City), Deputy Superintendent of Police (City), Deputy \nSuperintendent of Police (Detective), Senior Superintendent of Police, Ludhiana, \nDistrict Control Room and lastly to the concerned magistrate.  As before \ndelivering the report to the magistrate, he had delivered its copy at six other \nplaces, therefore, the report could be delivered to the concerned magistrate at \n0002 hours during night which shows that this witness has taken four hours time \nin delivering report to the magistrate.  In the present case, we do not find that \nthere was any delay at all in making over the report to concerned magistrate \nrather the same was very promptly sent and delivered to the learned magistrate.  \nThat apart, it is well settled that even if there is any delay in sending the special \nreport to a magistrate that alone cannot affect the prosecution case if the same is \notherwise found to be trustworthy. \n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"1919674\" id=\"span_1\">Learned Senior Counsel next submitted that in any view of the matter,  \nconviction of the  appellants  under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 302</a> IPC simpliciter is unwarranted as \nthere is no evidence to show that any of the two appellants inflicted fatal injury.  It \nhas been further submitted that their conviction  cannot be altered, by this Court,  \nto under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 302</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 34</a> IPC for sharing the common intention \nas no charge was framed under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 302</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 34</a> IPC but the \ncharge was framed under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 302</a> IPC simpliciter.  It has been further \nsubmitted that at the highest, the appellants can be convicted by this Court under \n<a href=\"/doc/1540253/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 326</a> IPC for causing grievous injury to the deceased by dangerous \nweapons.  Reliance in this connection was placed upon a three Judges&#x27; Bench \ndecision of this Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1919674/\" id=\"a_18\">Shamnsaheb M.Multtani v. State of \nKarnataka</a> (2001) 2 Supreme Court Cases 577.  In that case, charge was framed \nunder <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 302</a> IPC and the accused persons were acquitted by the trial court.  \nWhen the matter was taken in appeal by the State,  High Court reversed the order \nof acquittal but convicted accused under <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 304-B</a>  IPC which was \nchallenged before this Court.  After taking into consideration the provisions of \n<a href=\"/doc/936345/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 464</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, this Court laid down that a \nconviction would be valid even if there is omission or irregularity in the framing of \ncharge provided the same did not occasion a failure of justice.  In the said case,  \nCourt came to the conclusion that by non-framing of the charge under <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_22\">Section \n304-B</a> IPC, there was  failure of justice and the accused was prejudiced thereby in \nview of the fact that under <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 113-B</a> of the Evidence Act, there was a \nstatutory presumption against the accused which he was entitled to rebut and no \nsuch opportunity of rebuttal  was afforded to him in the absence of charge.  This \nbeing the position, this Court set aside the conviction under <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 304-B</a> IPC, \nremitted the matter to the trial court, directing it to proceed from the stage of \ndefence evidence.  Therefore<a href=\"/doc/1919674/\" id=\"a_25\">, <a href=\"/doc/1919674/\" id=\"a_26\">the said decision</a></a> is quite distinguishable and has \nno application to the present case.</span> \n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1086225\" id=\"span_2\">On behalf of the State, reference was made to a decision of this Court in \nthe case of <a href=\"/doc/1086225/\" id=\"a_27\">State of A.P. v.

After taking into consideration \nthe provisions of Section 464 and 465 of the Code, it was   laid down that unless it \ncould be shown from the evidence of witnesses as well as a statement of the \naccused under Section 313 of the Code that there was a failure of justice and \nthereby accused was prejudiced, the appellate court would not be justified in \nrefusing to convict the accused for the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_37\">149</a> IPC merely \nbecause  charge was framed under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 302</a> IPC simpliciter and not under \n<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_40\">149</a> IPC.

P.</a>, \nelaborately discussed the applicability of <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_43\">Sections 535</a> and <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_44\">537</a> of \nthe Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, which correspond \nrespectively to Sections 464 and 465 of the Code, and held that in \njudging a question of prejudice, as of guilt, courts must act with a \nbroad vision and look to the substance and not to technicalities, \nand their main concern should be to see whether the accused had \na fair trial, whether he knew what he was being tried for, whether \nthe main facts sought to be established against him were \nexplained to him fairly and clearly and whether he was given a full \nand fair chance to defend himself. Viewed in the context of the \nabove observations of this Court we are unable to hold that the \naccused persons were in any way prejudiced due to the errors and \nomissions in the charges pointed out by Mr. Arunachalam. Apart \nfrom the fact that this point was not agitated in either of the Courts \nbelow, from the fact that the material prosecution witnesses (who \nnarrated the entire incident) were cross examined at length from all \npossible angles and the suggestions that were put forward to the \neye witnesses we are fully satisfied that the accused persons were \nnot in any way prejudiced in their defence. While on this point we \nmay also mention that in their examination under Section 313 of \nthe Code, the accused persons were specifically told of their \nhaving committed offences (besides others) under <a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_45\">Sections 148</a> \nand <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_46\">302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_47\">149</a> IPC. For all these reasons we reject the threshold \ncontention of Mr. Arunachalam.</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1661153\" id=\"span_5\">Further, it  has been reiterated by this Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1661153/\" id=\"a_48\">Ramji Singh \nand another v. State of Bihar</a> (2001) 9 Supreme Court Cases 528 wherein also \ncharge was framed under Section 302 simpliciter but conviction was under</span> \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">Section 302 read with <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_49\">Section 34</a> IPC and it was laid down that conviction under \nSection 302 read with <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_50\">Section 34</a> IPC was warranted as the accused person \nshared the common intention  to cause  death of the victim and no prejudice was \ncaused to them because of non-framing of charge under Section 302 read with \n<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 34</a> IPC. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">\tIn the present case, it cannot be said that the accused persons were \nprejudiced merely because charge was framed under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 302</a> IPC simpliciter \nand no charge was framed under Section 302 read with <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_53\">Section 34</a> IPC.  From \nthe evidence of two eyewitnesses, namely, PWs 2 and 3 it would appear that the \naccused persons shared the common intention to cause death of the victim.  \nThey  were cross-examined at length from all possible angles and from the \nsuggestions that were put forth to the eyewitnesses, we are fully satisfied that the \naccused persons were not in any manner  prejudiced in their defence.  That \napart, in their examination under Section 313 of the Code, the appellants were \nspecifically told that they along with other accused persons armed with kirpan \ncame to the place of occurrence and assaulted the deceased whereafter  they  \nfled away which shows that appellants shared the common intention  to cause \ndeath  of the deceased.  \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"574841\" id=\"span_6\">Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant in this \nregard has further relied upon decision of this Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/574841/\" id=\"a_54\">Atmaram \nZingaraji v. State of Maharashtra</a> 1997 Criminal Lal Journal 4406  wherein \ncharge was framed under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_56\">149</a> IPC against nine accused persons \nwho were acquitted by the trial court and when  State of Maharashtra preferred \nan appeal, the High Court upheld acquittal of eight accused persons but reversed \nthe acquittal of ninth accused and convicted him under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_57\">Section 302</a> IPC \nsimpliciter.  Against the order of conviction, the accused moved this Court and \nhis conviction under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_58\">Section 302</a> IPC simpliciter was set aside on the ground that \nthere was no evidence to show that he inflicted the fatal injury and he could not \nbe convicted under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_59\">Section 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_60\">149</a> IPC as the other eight accused persons \nwere acquitted and their acquittal attained finality.  This Court, however, \nconvicted the accused under <a href=\"/doc/1540253/\" id=\"a_61\">Section 326</a> IPC for causing grievous injury by him \nto the deceased.</span> \t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"427909\" id=\"span_7\">Likewise, in the case of <a href=\"/doc/427909/\" id=\"a_62\">Roopa Ram v. State of Rajasthan</a> \n1999 Criminal Law Journal 2901 three accused persons were charged  under \nSection 302 and out of them two were acquitted by the trial court and one person \nwas convicted under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_63\">Section 302</a> IPC and his conviction was upheld by the High \nCourt.  When the matter was brought to this Court, it was found that the injury \ninflicted by the appellant before this Court could not be said to be fatal as such \nhis conviction under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_64\">Section 302</a> IPC simpliciter was unwarranted and the same \nwas set aside specially in view of the fact that he could not have been convicted \nunder Section 302 read with <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_65\">Section 34</a> IPC as other two accused persons had \nbeen already acquitted by the trial court itself and their acquittal attained finality.  \nIn these circumstances, this Court convicted the accused under <a href=\"/doc/1540253/\" id=\"a_66\">Section 326</a> of \nthe IPC for causing grievous injury to the deceased.  In our view, the aforesaid \ntwo cases have no application to the facts of the present case.  In view of the \nfacts set forth above,  we are of the  opinion that prosecution has succeeded in \nproving its case beyond reasonable doubt and conviction of the appellants under \n<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_67\">Section 302</a> IPC is liable to be altered to one under Section 302 read with \n<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_68\">Section 34</a> IPC as fatal injury could not be attributed to him. \n\tShri Prabha Shanker Misra, learned Senior Counsel appearing in support \nof Criminal Appeal No. 710 of 1995 apart from challenging conviction of appellant \nMohinder Pal Singh on merits, which  we have already dealt with, submitted that \non the date of the alleged occurrence, he was a juvenile  within the meaning of \n<a href=\"/doc/53839058/\" id=\"a_69\">Section 2(h)</a> of the Juvenile Justice Act, 1986 (hereinafter referred to as &#x27;the Act&#x27;) \nas on that date he had not attained the age of 16 years.  It appears that this point \nwas not raised either before the trial court or the High Court .  But it is well settled \nthat in such an eventuality, this Court should first consider the legality or \notherwise of conviction of the accused and in case the  conviction is upheld, a \nreport should be called for from the trial court on the point as to  whether the \naccused was juvenile  on the date of  occurrence and upon receipt of the report, \nif it is found that the accused was juvenile on such date and  continues to be so, \nhe shall be sent to juvenile home.   But  in case it finds that on the date of the \noccurrence, he was juvenile but on the date this Court is passing final order upon  \nthe report received from the trial court, he no longer continues to be juvenile, the \nsentence imposed against him would be liable to be set aside.</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1161696\" id=\"span_8\">Reference in this \nconnection may be made to  decision of this Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1161696/\" id=\"a_70\">Bhoop Ram v. \nState of U.P.</a> (1989) 3 Supreme Court Cases 1 in which case at the time of grant \nof special leave to appeal, report was called for from the trial court as to whether \nthe accused was juvenile or not which reported that the accused was not a \njuvenile on the date of the occurrence but this Court, differing with  the report of \ntrial court, came to the conclusion that  accused was juvenile on the date the \noffence was committed and as he was no longer a juvenile on the day of \njudgment of this Court, sentence awarded  against him was set aside, though \nconviction was upheld.\tIn the present case, we have already upheld \nconviction of appellant - Mohinder Pal Singh as well but it would be just and \nexpedient to call for a report from the trial court in relation to his age on the date \nof the occurrence.</span>  \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">Accordingly, Criminal Appeal No. 711 of 1995 filed by appellant - Gurpreet \nSingh fails and the same is dismissed.  Bail bonds of this appellant, who is on \nbail, are cancelled and he is directed to be taken into custody forthwith to serve \nout the remaining period of sentence for which a compliance report must be sent \nto this Court within one month  from the date of receipt of copy of this order. \n\tIn Criminal Appeal No. 710 of 1995 filed by appellant Mohinder Pal Singh, \ncall for a report from the trial court as to whether on the date of occurrence this \nappellant was juvenile within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/53839058/\" id=\"a_71\">Section 2(h)</a> of the Juvenile Justice \nAct, 1986?  The trial court shall give opportunity to both the parties to adduce \nevidence on this point.  Let the  entire original records of the trial court be \nreturned to it.  Report as well as records must be sent to this Court within a \nperiod of three months from the receipt of this order. Upon receipt of report from \nthe trial court, final order shall be passed in this appeal. \n</blockquote>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n",
