These appeals are directed against the common judgment and\n\n  order dated 29.05.2015 in D.B. Criminal Murder Reference No. 3 of 2013\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                               2</span>\n\fand D.B. Criminal Jail Appeal No. 854 of 2013 whereby, the High Court of\n\nJudicature for Rajasthan at Jodhpur has affirmed the judgment of\n\nconviction dated 28.09.2013 and order of sentencing dated 01.10.2013 in\n\nSessions Case No. 12 of 2013, as passed by the Court of Special Judge,\n\nProtection of Children from Sexual Offences Cases, Rajsamand.\n\n2.1.     The High Court, while upholding conviction of the appellant of\n\noffences punishable under <a href=\"/doc/619940/\" id=\"a_1\">Sections 363</a>, <a href=\"/doc/886598/\" id=\"a_2\">365</a>, <a href=\"/doc/334057/\" id=\"a_3\">376(2)(f)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_4\">302</a> of the Indian\n\nPenal Code, 18601 and Section 6 of the Protection of Children from\n\nSexual Offences Act, 20122, has confirmed the death sentence awarded\n\nto him by the Trial Court for the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 302</a> IPC.\n\n2.2.     In addition to the sentence of death for the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_6\">Section\n\n302</a> IPC, the appellant has been awarded the punishments of\n\nimprisonment for a term of 7 years and fine of Rs. 25,000/- for the offence\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/619940/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 363</a> IPC; imprisonment for a term of 7 years and fine of Rs.\n\n25,000/- for the offence under <a href=\"/doc/886598/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 365</a> IPC; imprisonment for life and\n\na fine of Rs. 50,000/- for the offence under <a href=\"/doc/334057/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 376(2)(f)</a> IPC; and\n\nimprisonment for life and a fine of Rs. 1,00,000/- for the offence under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1633827/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 6</a> POCSO. While providing for default stipulations of further\n\nimprisonment in case of non-payment of fine amount, it has also been\n\nprovided that the fine amount shall be given to the mother of the\n\ndeceased girl as compensation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">\n\n1 Hereinafter also referred to as ‘<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_11\">IPC</a>’.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">2 Hereinafter also referred to as ‘POCSO’.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                             3</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">\f3.     In these appeals, the conviction of the appellant as also the\n\npunishment awarded to him, particularly the capital punishment, are\n\nunder challenge. Before dealing with the relevant aspects in necessary\n\ndetails, we may draw a brief sketch and outline of the matter.\n\n3.1.   The appellant has been accused of kidnapping a physically and\n\nmentally challenged seven-and-a-half-year-old girl in front of her parents\n\nfrom their fruit and vegetable vending cart; having thereafter taken her to\n\na secluded place; having committed rape upon her; and having killed her\n\nby causing injuries on her head.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">3.2.   The prosecution case rested on circumstantial evidence to the\n\neffect that the victim was lastly seen with the appellant when he took her\n\naway; that the dead body of victim and other articles related with the\n\ncrime were recovered at the instance of the appellant; that the appellant\n\nfailed to satisfactorily explain his whereabouts and his knowledge of the\n\nlocation of dead body; and that the medical and other scientific evidence\n\nwas consistent with the prosecution case. Thus, according to the\n\nprosecution, the entire chain of events was complete and was conclusive\n\nof the guilt of the appellant, excluding any other hypothesis. Per contra,\n\nthe appellant asserted that he was falsely implicated, though he did not\n\nadduce any evidence in defence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">3.3.   In its judgment dated 28.09.2013, the Trial Court convicted the\n\nappellant of the offences aforesaid with the findings that the prosecution\n\nhad been able to substantiate the charges by proving beyond doubt that\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                     4</span>\n\fthe appellant kidnapped the victim girl, committed rape and then\n\nmurdered her and concealed the dead body. Then, on 01.10.2013, after\n\nhaving heard the accused-appellant and the prosecution on the question\n\nof sentence, the Trial Court found no reason to take any lenient view in\n\nthe matter, particularly looking to the gruesome nature of crime and thus,\n\nawarded varying punishments, including that of death sentence under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 302</a> IPC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\">3.4.      The sentence of death was submitted for confirmation to the High\n\nCourt in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1146308/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 366</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 3.\n\nOn the other hand, the accused-appellant preferred an appeal against the\n\njudgment and order of the Trial Court. Both, the reference case for\n\nconfirmation of death sentence and the appeal preferred by the appellant,\n\nwere considered together and the High Court, after finding that each and\n\nevery incriminating circumstance had clearly been established, affirmed\n\nthe conviction. As regards the question of sentence, the High Court, with\n\nreference to the nature of offence, in brutal rape and murder of a seven-\n\nand-a-half-year-old mentally and physically challenged girl along with the\n\ncalculated attempt to cover up the crime, found the present one to be\n\n‘rarest of rare case’ and, accordingly, confirmed the punishments awarded\n\nto the appellant, including the sentence of death.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\">3.5.      In the present appeals, conviction of the appellant has been\n\nquestioned essentially with the contentions that the investigation was not\n\n\n3 ‘<a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_14\">CrPC</a>’, for short.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                     5</span><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_12\">\n\fimpartial; that the trial was conducted in a hurried manner; that proper\n\nlegal aid with a counsel of sufficient experience was not provided to the\n\nappellant; that probability of false implication cannot be ruled out since\n\nthe name of the appellant was not stated in the missing person report;\n\nand that blood sample might not have been collected from the motorcycle\n\nsince, admittedly, it was raining heavily at the relevant time. The sentence\n\nawarded to the appellant has also been put to the question, essentially\n\nwith the submissions that awarding of sentence both under <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_15\">IPC</a> and\n\nPOCSO is not sustainable; and that the Trial Court as also the High Court\n\nhave not properly examined the mitigating factors existing in favour of the\n\nappellant, including the residual doubts in the weak chain of\n\ncircumstances. It is also submitted that in the hurriedly conducted trial,\n\nthe appellant was unable to effectively present his case; and that the\n\nyoung age of the appellant, his poor socio-economic background with\n\nfamily members being dependant on him, and the likelihood of\n\nreformation deserve due consideration as mitigating factors against\n\ncapital punishment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_13\">3.6.   Per contra, it is contended on behalf of the respondent-State that\n\nthe evidence of the witnesses related with the deceased is duly\n\ncorroborated by the testimony of independent witnesses; that name of the\n\nappellant finds mentioned in the missing person report as also in the FIR;\n\nand that the forensic and medical evidence is consistent with the case of\n\nthe prosecution. It is also submitted that the abhorrent nature of crime\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                     6</span>\n\fjustifies awarding of death sentence in the present case, where the\n\nappellant kidnapped a minor girl who was not of sound physical and\n\nmental health; and committed brutal rape and murder. It has also been\n\nsubmitted that the subsequent conduct of the appellant in jail has been\n\nmoreover questionable and he had killed another inmate with stone for\n\nwhich, he has been further convicted of the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_17\">34</a>\n\nIPC; and this demonstrates that the appellant is a threat to the society.\n\n3.7.   Thus, two major points would arise for determination in these\n\nappeals; first, as to whether conviction of the appellant calls for any\n\ninterference; and second, if conviction is maintained, as to whether the\n\nsentence of death awarded to the appellant deserves to be affirmed or\n\ndeserves to be substituted by any other sentence?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_14\">4.     With the aforesaid outline, we may take note of the relevant\n\nfactual and background aspects in necessary details.\n\nRelevant factual and background aspects\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_15\">5.     The prosecution in the present case had its foundation in the oral\n\ninformation stated in the form of complaint by PW-1 Kamla on 17.01.2013\n\nat about 08:15 p.m. at Police Station Kankroli, District Rajsamand while\n\nbeing accompanied by her father PW-3 Madan Lal. The complainant\n\nalleged that earlier in the day, she was at her fruit-vegetable vending cart\n\nnear R. K. Hospital with her husband PW-2 Dharam Das and her father\n\nPW-3 Madan Lal; that at around 06:30 p.m., Manoj Singh, who earlier\n\nlived in the nearby Housing Board Colony, came to her cart on a\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                     7</span>\n\fmotorcycle, purchased fruits and gave chocolates to her 8-year-old\n\nmentally challenged daughter K4 and left; that he returned to the cart after\n\nabout 10 minutes, placed her daughter K on his motorcycle and\n\nproceeded towards Somnath Chauraha; and that attempts were made to\n\nchase him but he was not found. It was also stated by the complainant\n\nthat she could not note the registration number of the motorcycle but the\n\nsame was of sky-blue colour. The complainant also described the\n\nfeatures and attire of her daughter and alleged that Manoj Singh had\n\nkidnapped her daughter.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_16\">5.1.     The contents of aforesaid oral complaint were reduced in writing\n\n(Ex. P-1) by PW-19 Nand Lal, who was the Officer-in-charge of Police\n\nStation Kankroli at the relevant time (as the Station House Officer 5 PW-20\n\nGanesh Nath was away) and, accordingly, FIR No. 16 of 2013 (Ex. P-2)\n\ncame to be registered for the offence under <a href=\"/doc/619940/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 363</a> IPC.\n\n5.2.     The said PW-19 Nand Lal immediately commenced investigation\n\nand recorded the statements of informant Kamla as also of her father\n\nMadan Lal; informed the SHO; transmitted messages for Nakabandi; and\n\nalso carried out unsuccessful search at the Housing Board Colony and\n\nother places. Thereafter, the SHO - PW-20 Ganesh Nath - took over\n\ninvestigation and recorded the statement of Dharam Das, father of the\n\n4 Having regard to the nature of case, the name of victim has been omitted in the narrations and\nextractions and at all other places in this judgment; and is substituted by the expression ‘K’. For\nclarification, it may also be stated that the name of victim girl has been mentioned differently and\nwith alias at different places. But her identity is otherwise not in dispute and we have retained\nthe substituted expression ‘K’ at every place, irrespective of any of the alternative names\nappearing.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_17\">5 ‘SHO’, for short.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                                 8</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_18\">\n\fvictim girl; and in view of the allegations, added the offence under <a href=\"/doc/886598/\" id=\"a_19\">Section\n\n365</a> IPC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_19\">5.3.   All the proceedings aforesaid took place until midnight of\n\n17.01.2013. The SHO, thereafter, proceeded in search of the victim and\n\nthe offender while taking the said Madan Lal and Dharam Das with him.\n\nUltimately, the accused-appellant was found at the Old Bus Stand,\n\nKankroli, at about 2 a.m., who divulged his name and particulars as\n\nManoj Pratap Singh son of Surendra Pratap Singh Rajput, resident of\n\nBasantpur, Police Station Gugli, District Maharajganj, Uttar Pradesh. He\n\nwas taken to Police Station Kankroli, was arrested, and his clothes\n\ncarrying bloodstains were seized.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_20\">5.4.    It has been the case of prosecution that on being questioned, the\n\nappellant stated that he had killed the girl whom he kidnapped near R. K.\n\nHospital and her dead body was lying near Kamal Talai, which he could\n\nget recovered. The information so furnished by the appellant was\n\nrecorded (Ex. P-40); and the body of the deceased was recovered at\n\naround 3:15 a.m. from a patari by the bridge at Kamal Talai as per the\n\ndisclosure of the appellant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_21\">5.5.   In view of the recovery of the dead body of K, the offence under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 302</a> IPC was added for investigation. The SHO prepared the\n\nnecessary memos and reports and sent the dead body for post-mortem\n\nexamination. In view of the post-mortem report indicating rape with the\n\nvictim, the offence under <a href=\"/doc/334057/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 376(2)(f)</a> was also added. The SHO also\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                     9</span>\n\fgot the accused-appellant examined in relation to the injuries on his body.\n\nIn the meantime, investigation was transferred to the Circle Officer,\n\nRajsamand PW-25 Umesh Ojha. According to prosecution, the accused-\n\nappellant divulged more information on 19.01.2013 about the location of\n\nmotorcycle used in the crime as also the place of committing the crime\n\nand the place where clothing of the deceased was lying. This information\n\nwas reduced in writing (Ex. P-48) and in pursuance thereof, motorcycle\n\nbearing registration number RJ30 3M 5944 was recovered; the\n\nbloodstains on the motorcycle were collected; the frock-like-skirt of the\n\ndeceased was recovered; the place of incident was identified; and\n\nbloodstained soil as also control soil were collected and sealed. Further,\n\nthe Investigating Officer got the accused-appellant medically examined for\n\nsexual potency and his blood sample was also collected. The collected\n\narticles/samples were sent for Forensic Science Laboratory 6 examination.\n\nThe Investigating Officer further collected the certificates relating to the\n\ndate of birth of the victim as also the certificates concerning her mental\n\nand physical disablement.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_22\">5.6.      The Investigating Officer also recorded the statements of\n\nwitnesses who had allegedly seen the accused-appellant taking the victim\n\ngirl on his motorcycle. Apart from other witnesses, PW-12 Ranjeet Singh,\n\nthe salesman of a liquor shop, stated that the accused-appellant came to\n\nhis shop at about 6:30 p.m. with a girl sitting on the motorcycle,\n\n\n6 ‘FSL’, for short.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                    10</span><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_23\">\n\fpurchased a bottle of beer and also quarrelled regarding the price. As per\n\nthe contents of charge-sheet, the Investigating Officer also found, after\n\ncarrying out background verification, that the accused-appellant had been\n\ninvolved in a few other criminal cases. Significantly, it was found that the\n\nsaid motorcycle bearing registration No. RJ30 3M 5944 was stolen from\n\nNathdwara on 14.01.2013 for which, an FIR bearing No. 39 of 2013 had\n\nalready been registered at Police Station Nathdwara for offence under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1101188/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 379</a> IPC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_24\">5.7.   In the post-mortem examination, the Medical Board found varying\n\ninjuries on the dead body of the victim, including those on head and on\n\nprivate parts. The Medical Board opined that the cause of death was head\n\ninjury and that the deceased had been subjected to ante-mortem rape.\n\n5.8.   After other processes of investigation, charge-sheet was filed\n\nagainst the appellant on 02.02.2013 and the case was committed to the\n\nCourt of Sessions. At the request of the accused-appellant, legal aid was\n\nprovided to him from the District Legal Services Authority and the Court\n\nheard the matter for framing of charge only after appointment of a legal\n\naid counsel. The appellant was charged of the offences under <a href=\"/doc/619940/\" id=\"a_23\">Sections\n\n363</a>, <a href=\"/doc/886598/\" id=\"a_24\">365</a>, <a href=\"/doc/334057/\" id=\"a_25\">376(2)(f)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_26\">302</a> IPC and <a href=\"/doc/1633827/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 6</a> POCSO. The appellant\n\npleaded not guilty and claimed trial.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_25\">\n\n\nThe Evidence\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                        11</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">\f6.       In trial, the prosecution examined as many as 25 witnesses and\n\nproduced 52 documents.

PW-1 Kamla, mother of the deceased-child, deposed on the basic\n\nand primary facts of this case in her examination-in-chief as under: -\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">            “The incident is of 17.1.2013 at 6.30 p.m. I use to place my\n         fruits and vegetables cart outside R.K.

Accused Manoj\n         Pratap Singh, present in the Court, gave my daughter kurkure and\n         chocolate on which we told him not to do so but he gave these\n         articles to my daughter and left. After 10-15 minutes accused\n         Manoj Pratap Singh again came and took my daughter on\n         motorcycle towards Somnath Chouraha. At that time my father\n         Madan Lal and husband Dharam Das followed accused but they\n         could not find him. Motorcycle was of sky-blue colour. I had not\n         seen the number of motorcycle. At that time my daughter K was\n         wearing a red kurta, pink colour jacket and black legging. The\n         colour of my daughter was fair and height 4 feet. We went to police\n         station.

I was sitting where my lorry was near R.K.\n       Hospital Rajsamand. In the night at 12.30 we came to know that\n       accused Manoj Pratap Singh had been found. Then we were\n       called at the police station. Accused Manoj Pratap Singh took my\n       husband and father to Kamal Talai where dead body of my\n       daughter K was found. Accused Manoj Pratap Singh was residing\n       at Housing Board and sometimes came to us to buy vegetables;\n       therefore, I could identify him. Accused Manoj Pratap Singh took\n       my daughter and killed her.”\n\n7.1.1. On being cross-examined, this witness stated as under: -\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">          “At that time, accused Manoj Pratap Singh was wearing brown\n       coloured jacket. On that day, we lodged a missing report of K. It is\n       true that my daughter K was mentally retarded. It is wrong to say\n       that my daughter had been missing once or twice before this\n       incident. It is wrong to say that my daughter used to go here and\n       there without informing me. I do not know where accused Manoj\n       Pratap Singh used to work. It is correct to say that I did not raise\n       any alarm when accused took my daughter because at that time\n       there was nobody nearby. I do not know the time of death of my\n       daughter. We went to the police station in the evening at 7.45 p.m.\n       The accused took away my daughter at 6.30 p.m. The police\n       station is located at a distance of about 7 km from the place of\n       incident. We hired an auto to the police station and it took about\n       30-45 minutes. We lodged missing report of my daughter at the\n       police station. It is true that at the time of lodging the missing\n       report, we did not mention the name of accused Manoj Pratap\n       Singh.”\n\n7.1.2. The aforesaid deposition of PW-1 Kamla was recorded on\n\n05.04.2013. At that point of time, clothing of the deceased had been with\n\nthe FSL and the same were received later in the Trial Court. The\n\nprosecution, after completion of other evidence, moved an application\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1780550/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 311</a> CrPC for further examination of this witness PW-1\n\nKamla, for the purpose of identification of the clothes of deceased. This\n\napplication was duly contested by the learned counsel for the accused-\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_30\">appellant with the submissions that such recalling of the witness would be\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                      13</span>\n\fallowing the prosecution to fill up the lacunae in its case. However, the\n\nTrial Court, by its considered order dated 26.08.2013, accepted the said\n\napplication looking to its purpose and while indicating that the accused\n\nwould nevertheless have the opportunity of cross-examination. This\n\nwitness PW-1 Kamla was, accordingly, again examined on 04.09.2013\n\nwhere she stated about the attire of her daughter when she was\n\nkidnapped by the accused-appellant and duly identified Article No. 1,\n\nbeing the leggy (lower) as also Article No. 7, being the kurta (frock) of her\n\ndaughter K.\n\n7.2.   PW-2 Dharam Das, father of the deceased girl, corroborated the\n\ntestimony of PW-1 Kamla and stated that the appellant came and took\n\ntheir daughter. He also stated that he was present when the appellant\n\nwas arrested from Kankroli Bus Stand, when the appellant made a\n\ndisclosure statement at the police station, and when the body of his\n\ndaughter was recovered at the instance of the appellant. This witness\n\nalso testified to various proceedings of recoveries and seizures and\n\nidentified his signatures on various memos like that of site inspection,\n\narrest of the appellant, recovery of the dead body, its panchayatnama etc.\n\nThis witness further testified that his daughter was 8 years of age and\n\nwas mentally retarded; and exhibited the relevant documents in that\n\nregard, being Ex. P-11 to P-14. This witness was also thoroughly cross-\n\nexamined where he stated, inter alia, as under: -\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">         “I am hawker of fruits and vegetables. On the day of incident, I\n       was at the cart. That time I was selling vegetables to customers.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                     14</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">\f       That time accused Manoj Pratap Singh was the customer who\n       bought fruits and went. It is wrong that thereafter accused Manoj\n       Pratap did not come to the cart. That time it was drizzling,\n       therefore none else was there. It is wrong that there were some\n       more carts near my carts; other carts were away from my cart. I do\n       not know the names of other cart owners. There is a milkman’s\n       shop, which is away from my lorry. There are some carts of snacks\n       but due to cold weather and rain fall, there was no cart. We were\n       about to go home after some time, but accused Manoj Pratap\n       Singh abducted and took away my daughter. He lured by giving\n       chocolate to my daughter. It is wrong that I do not know accused\n       Manoj Pratap Singh. He used to come to my cart. It is wrong that\n       my daughter went with accused with her consent, but she was\n       abducted by accused Manoj Pratap Singh. It is true that K went\n       with the accused Manoj Pratap Singh on being lured by chocolate.\n       I stopped my daughter but as she was feebleminded and so, did\n       not stop. It is true that at the time the accused abducted and took\n       away my daughter, nobody was there. That time accused Manoj\n       Pratap Singh was wearing check shirt and jacket. My daughter\n       was not wearing any footwear. On 17.1.2013 at night signature\n       was taken on memo Ex. P-3. Then said, signature was taken on\n       another day. While signature was taken nobody was with me.\n       Then said, my father-in-law was also with me. My signature was\n       taken on Ext. P-3 at police station. Then said signature was taken\n       at Kamal Talai. Signature was taken at different times which I do\n       not remember. The police officials did not read over and explain\n       what was written on the document. Then said that they read over\n       and explained the contents but do not remember the same today. I\n       am illiterate, I can only sign therefore, I do not know the contents\n       of memo Ex. P-4. It is wrong that when we went to the police\n       station, accused Manoj Pratap Singh was sitting in the police\n       station. I had said that he was sitting at bus stand. Accused Manoj\n       Pratap Singh was arrested on the same night. It is wrong that\n       police officials did not seize clothes in front of me. The same were\n       seized in the night of 17.1.2013. I do not know what was written on\n       jacket of accused Manoj Pratap Singh. My daughter&#x27;s dead body\n       was found at Taledi Kamal Talai. Dead body was lying at the\n       bridge. Bruises were found on head and all other parts of body of\n       my daughter. It is wrong that injuries were not found on the legs. It\n       is wrong that police official took my signature on memo at police\n       station. Signature was taken at different places such as police\n       station and house. It is true that Ex. P-12 was released after the\n       incident. It is true that certificate Ex. P-14 was also released after\n       the incident.”\n\n7.3.   Father of the informant, PW-3 Madan Lal, also corroborated the\n\ntestimony of PW-1 Kamla and PW-2 Dharam Das as regards kidnapping\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                       15</span>\n\fof the victim girl by the appellant, arrest of the appellant, his disclosure\n\nstatement at the police station, and the subsequent recovery of the body\n\nof the victim girl at the instance of the appellant. He also deposed\n\nregarding the memos of arrest, seizure, recoveries, and panchayatnama,\n\nand identified his signatures on the memos Ex. P-5 to Ex. P-8. We may\n\nusefully extract the relevant part of statement made by this witness in his\n\ncross-examination as follows: -\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">           “…..At about 6:30 p.m., I reached the place of incident and\n       stood there. Accused Manoj Pratap Singh came to buy vegetables\n       just after me and thereafter some more customers came. About 15\n       feet away from my son-in-law&#x27;s cart, there were some more carts.\n       Saras Milk Diary and Ayurvedic medicine shop is also there. Due\n       to rainfall and storm, there was nobody. That time accused Manoj\n       Pratap Singh bought fruits and vegetable, gave chocolate to the\n       baby girl and went. Then after 10-15 minutes he came back at\n       6:30 p.m. and immediately took the child on his motorcycle and\n       went away. Since the child was feebleminded, she used to sit with\n       anybody. We were attending the customers. It is wrong that I have\n       not seen the accused abducting the child and the customers\n       informed about the abduction. Somnath Choraha is approximately\n       3-4 km away from the place of incident. Baby girl&#x27;s dead body was\n       found at Kamal Talai bridge. I do not know about the direction of\n       Kamal Talai from the place of incident. I could not see the accused\n       Manoj Pratap Singh. Then we went to the police post. We went to\n       Bandiyabada police post where missing report was lodged that the\n       accused Manoj Pratap Singh took away the child. Because we\n       knew the name of Manoj Pratap Singh, we gave his name in the\n       report. I do not know the name of father of accused Manoj Pratap\n       Singh. We went to search accused Manoj Pratap Singh because\n       the child was with him. We reached police station at about 7:00-\n       8:00 p.m. Two police Jeeps came out of the police station, one\n       moved towards R. K. Hospital and another moved towards bus\n       stand. In one of the Jeep, my daughter Kamla and some police\n       officials went towards R. K. Hospital. In another Jeep, Dharam\n       Das, some of the police officials went towards bus stand. I was\n       sitting on the motorcycle of my colleague Manilal. Then we\n       searched Dhoinda and various other places in jeep but we were\n       unable to find anyone, so we returned to the police station and in\n       second round, we went towards bus stand. In the first instance we\n       went to Dhoinda via R K; it is wrong that we went via Kamal Talai\n       road, instead we went via bypass. We met accused Manoj Pratap\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                                     16</span>\n\f       Singh present in the court when we went to bus stand in the\n       second round. Accused Manoj Pratap Singh was wearing jacket\n       and jeans and at that time it was raining lightly. Accused Manoj\n       Pratap Singh was standing near the water kiosk. Nobody was near\n       him. Firstly, the police saw the accused Manoj Pratap Singh with\n       bloodstains on his clothes.….Accused Manoj was brought to\n       police station in jeep and upon enquiry he disclosed that the child\n       had been left at Kamal Talai bridge. On one side of Kamal Talai\n       bridge there was a house whose name I do not remember and on\n       the other side was a cremation ground. Ex. P-3 Site Plan of the\n       place of incident was prepared at 7:00 a.m. At Kamal Talai, I\n       signed at two or three places… It is true that, I have not seen\n       anyone killing my granddaughter K.”\n\n7.4.   PW-5 Maniraj Singh has been an independent witness to the\n\nkidnapping of the victim girl, as also to the inquest report. He stated in his\n\nexamination-in-chief all the essential facts in corroboration of the\n\nstatements above-noted. He also testified to the inquest report, seizure\n\nmemo and other memos concerning delivery of dead body, site plan of\n\nKamal Talai and site plan of the place of kidnapping. In his cross-\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\">examination, this witness stated, inter alia, as under: -\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">       “….The place of Incident is 200 to 300 feet away from my office.\n       On the day of incident other carts were open. I do not remember\n       the name of carts which were open. I know deceased K. It is\n       wrong that I did not see K when she was abducted. That time we\n       did not know that accused Manoj Pratap Singh is abducting the\n       child; therefore we did not prevent him from doing so. It is wrong\n       that K willingly sat on the motorcycle of the accused, instead the\n       accused caught her and made her sit in front seat of his\n       motorcycle. I did not know that accused is abducting the child;\n       therefore I did not stop him. It is correct that at that time other\n       persons were also standing at the fruit cart. It is correct that other\n       persons who were standing at the fruit cart did not stop him. It is\n       possible that in my police statement, I have stated that the colour\n       of the motorcycle was sky blue but in my statement the colour of\n       the motorcycle has been written as green. It is correct that I am off\n       duty at 5:00 p.m. It is true that I have motorcycle, and I am using it\n       to go to my office. It is correct that at that time I did not try to follow\n       accused Manoj Pratap Singh because my motorcycle was parked\n       at some distance. I do not know about employment of accused\n       Manoj Pratap Singh. I know accused Manoj Pratap Singh as I\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                                         17</span>\n\f         used to see him at that place for past two to four months. I do not\n         have any special identification of accused Manoj Pratap Singh. It\n         is wrong that someone dictated me the name of accused Manoj\n         Pratap Singh. The place of Incident is opposite to the place from\n         where the dead body of K was recovered. Accused Manoj Pratap\n         Singh took away K towards Somnath Choraha which is in another\n         direction. There were injuries on right eye below eyebrows and\n         behind the head above the neck of the deceased K…. It is wrong\n         that my signature was taken on all the memos at the same time.\n         Then said whatever memos were prepared were signed by him\n         after reading. I do not remember the colour of the clothes that the\n         accused Manoj Pratap Singh was wearing at the time of incident.”\n\n7.5.     PW-17 Dinesh Bhatia had been another witness to the kidnapping\n\nof the deceased. He is brother of PW-2 Dharam Das, and has a tea stall\n\nbehind the cart of PW-1 Kamla.

One more independent witness, in regard to the fact that the\n\ndeceased girl was last seen with the appellant, had been PW-12 Ranjeet\n\nSingh. He was the salesman at a liquor shop, where the appellant\n\nstopped to purchase beer immediately after taking the victim girl on his\n\nmotorcycle. This witness stated in his examination-in-chief that the\n\nappellant came to his shop with an eight-year-old girl sitting on his\n\nmotorcycle, purchased a bottle of beer, and even quarrelled as regards\n\nthe price. The relevant portion of this testimony would read as under: -\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">             “I work as a salesman at Salampura Wine Shop.

On the\n       same day, they took my statement. I work alone on the Salampura\n       Wine Shop. At first he did not gave twenty rupees but thereafter he\n       gave it. The fact of giving twenty rupees has not been written in\n       the police statement. It was a sky-blue coloured passion\n       motorcycle.

PW-14 Dr. Manju Purohit, who was working as Gynaecologist, R.\n\nK. Hospital, Rajsamand at the relevant time and was a member of the\n\nMedical Board, testified to the aforesaid post-mortem report and to the\n\nsteps taken by the Medical Board in collecting, sealing and delivering\n\nvarious samples/swabs. This witness was not only cross-examined on\n\nbehalf of the accused-appellant, but was also posed questions by the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">                                      21</span>\n\fCourt and was cross-examined yet further. The relevant part of her\n\ntestimony in cross-examinations and Court questioning could be usefully\n\nextracted as under: -\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">          “Generally, after six hours of death, rigor mortis starts in a body\n       but it also depends upon the weather condition. It is wrong to say\n       that contraction was found in the body. All the external injuries\n       mentioned in Ex. P-35 post-mortem report cannot be sustained\n       together by falling from motorcycle. Injuries below neck, jaw and\n       vagina cannot be sustained after falling from a motorcycle. It is\n       wrong to say that the injuries could be sustained due to dupatta\n       stuck on the neck. It is correct that at the time of examination,\n       human semen was not found on her body.

This witness further testified to the physical examination of\n\nthe accused-appellant after his arrest, when she found abrasions on his\n\nright knee and made such an entry on the application of the Investigating\n\nOfficer (Ex. P-41). The relevant parts of her testimony in cross-\n\nexamination would read as under: -\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">       “….

It is correct that in Ex. P 35, from X\n       to Y, it has not been mentioned in the opinion regarding death that\n       which of the specific injury sustained on which part of the head\n       resulted in death but in the opinion of medical board, multiple\n       injuries were found on the head of the deceased which collectively\n       resulted in death of the deceased. The said injuries can be\n       sustained by blunt weapon or by ramming the head on stone. It is\n       correct that in this context, there is no opinion of the medical board\n       available on Ex. P35 post-mortem report. Signature of PMO is\n       from G to H on Ex.

As regards age of the deceased and her mental and physical\n\ndisabilities, the prosecution led documentary evidence in support, being\n\nthe Medical Board’s Certificate dated 04.03.2010 on permanent disability\n\n(Ex. P-11), where it was noted that the deceased K suffered from spastic\n\npalsy with 70% permanent disability; Progress Report (Ex.

The said Certificates (Exs. P-12 to P-14) gave her date of birth\n\nas 09.07.2005. PW-18 Dr. Narendra Paliwal proved the said Certificate\n\nEx. P-11. The relevant part of his deposition in the cross-examination\n\nwould read as under: -\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">       “It is correct that in Ex.P-11 certificate, the age of K is not\n       mentioned and identification mark is also not mentioned.….It is\n       correct that in Ex.

I had issued the said\n       certificate for physical disability and not for any neurological\n       examination. It is correct that the said certificate is related to\n       orthopaedics.

As per\n         the information obtained, we went to the place of incident for\n         investigation and recovery alongwith the summoned witnessed\n         Kuldeep Singh and Ajay Singh and accused Manoj Pratap Singh.\n         As per the information of accused Manoj Pratap Singh we reached\n         near canal ahead of cremation ground on the way to Dhoinda from\n         50 feet road where the accused Manoj Pratap Singh asked us to\n         stop; hence we stopped the vehicle and got down. Then accused\n         Manoj Pratap Singh pointed towards east and said that it was the\n         place where he raped the deceased and left the motorcycle. ….\n         250 meters away from where we got down, accused Manoj Pratap\n         Singh… who was walking in front of us, stopped and pointed\n         towards the place where he left the motorcycle. We saw the\n         motorcycle lying near the bundle of sticks. The side of the\n         motorcycle where there is silencer was touching the ground, head\n         light of motorcycle was towards wall of field, motorcycle was blood\n         smeared and its number was RJ 30 3M 5944. Accused Manoj\n         Pratap Singh stated that on this very motorcycle he brought the\n         girl here. The said motorcycle was used in the incident and\n         therefore, it was seized and memo prepared which is Ex. P-15…\n         Motorcycle’s right side back indicator was broken and hanging;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_68\">         and its petrol tank, silencer, engine body, and rim of backside tyre\n         were smeared with blood. Since it was not possible to send the\n         motorcycle to FSL for examination of the bloodstains on it,\n         specimen sample of blood was taken on gauze of white cloth and\n         control sample was also taken; and they were placed in separate\n         plastic containers and were sealed. The sample was marked D\n         and control was marked D 1 for which a separate memo was\n         prepared which is Ex. P-16.…\n\n\n8 It may be indicated that this witness PW-25 also asserted about the appellant having made\nother disclosures like the place where he smashed the head of the victim girl on hard gravelly\nsurface (stone) upon her resistance; and having smashed her forehead between silencer and\nengine of motorcycle etc. These parts of his testimony as also other parts of formal nature have\nbeen omitted from extraction.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">                                              29</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_69\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_70\">\f    Thereafter      accused    Manoj    Pratap    Singh…       walked\napproximately 3 metres from where motorcycle was lying and\nindicated by his hand and said that there is frock-type skirt, which\nthe deceased girl was wearing; on a close look, the skirt was of\nred colour with light yellow dots; the skirt was torn and there was\nblood on its lower side..…\n    …Thereafter…Manoj Pratap Singh…walked to another side of\nway approximately 2.5 metres, showed by hand, and said that at\nthis place I raped the deceased girl, That place was looking hard\non which scratch marks and bloodstains were there.

We may also usefully extract the relevant parts of the statement\n\nmade by this witness in cross-examination as under: -\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">           “It is true that from where motorcycle was seized was an open\n       area. It is also true that from where deceased&#x27;s frock was seized\n       was an open area. It is wrong that cremation ground was near the\n       place of incident but was far away from there. It is wrong that\n       public movement is there at the place of incident. 50 feet road is\n       far away from the place of incident. It is wrong that near canal\n       public way is situated rather, trails type way is available for\n       movement towards fields. It is true that information provided by the\n       accused under <a href=\"/doc/412448/\" id=\"a_31\">section 27</a> which is Ex. P-48 was written by me. It\n       is true that accused Manoj Pratap is educated. The accused Manoj\n       Pratap Singh was only signed on Ex. P-48. It is wrong that houses\n       are constructed nearby the place of incident. Fields being situated\n       near the place of incident and nobody being there, the information\n       about fields was obtained from the area patvari and the owners\n       were asked about the incident but they did not have any\n       information and therefore their statement not recorded….It is true\n       that there was one house near the place where the victim’s dead\n       body was lying, which was a little away. It is true that the person\n       who was residing in that house had no knowledge about the\n       incident that took place in the night and therefore, his statement\n       was not recorded. It is true that the bridge where the victim’s dead\n       body was found might be of public movement, but as the incident\n       happened during night therefore, there would have been no public\n       movement at that time….. I can&#x27;t say that there had been rainfall at\n       the time of incident. I can&#x27;t say that there had been rainfall on\n       second day of incident….It is true that information related to\n       incident as given by the accused was recorded word to word. It is\n       wrong that at that time accused told that he is innocent. It is wrong\n       that seized article were safely not sent to the FSL for test. It is true\n       that no criminal case was lodged against the accused at Police\n       Station Gugali, District Maharajganj, (Uttar Pradesh) which is\n       endorsed on the back of memo Ex. P-31. It is wrong that I was\n       under pressure and carried out wrong investigation. It is wrong\n       that there had been demonstrations in the city when the accused\n       was not found; rather, after his arrest there had been\n       demonstrations against him. It is wrong that I investigated the case\n       only on the basis of circumstantial evidence, rather investigated\n       with recording of the statements of independent witnesses present\n       at the time of kidnapping. It is true that no one had seen the\n       accused raping and killing the deceased.”\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">                                        31</span>\n\f9.3.2.

PW-23 Ramdev Regar, Sub-Inspector of Police, deposed\n\nregarding the fact that a report about theft of motorcycle bearing\n\nregistration No. RJ30 3M 5944 was lodged at Police Station Nathdwara\n\non 14.01.2013. This witness stated as under: -\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">       “On 14.01.2013, I was posted as Sub Inspector at Nathdwara\n       Police Station.

The Trial Court, in the first place, took up for consideration the\n\nquestions relating to the age and alleged disablement of the deceased.\n\nThe Trial Court held, with reference to the Medical Board’s Certificate on\n\nPermanent Disability dated 04.03.2010 (Ex. P-11) and the statement of\n\nPW-18 Dr. Narendra Paliwal, that the deceased was suffering from\n\nspastic palsy because of which, the aggregate percentage of her\n\npermanent disability was 70%. The doctor also specified that the medical\n\ncondition of the deceased girl was due to imbalance between the\n\nmovements of limbs and brain. The Court also referred to the statements\n\nof PW-1 Kamla, PW-2 Dharam Das, PW-3 Madan Lal, PW-17 Dinesh\n\nBhatia and PW-5 Maniraj Singh, who testified to the fact that the\n\ndeceased was a mentally and physically challenged child.

As regards the age, with reference to the aforesaid Certificate (Ex.\n\nP-12) as also the Progress Report of the same school for the session\n\n2009-10 (Ex. P-13) and the Certificate from the Government Primary\n\nSchool, Gardiyawas Dohinda (Ex. P-14), the Trial Court found that the\n\ndate of birth of the deceased K was 09.07.2005 and hence, she was\n\nabout 7½ years of age on the date of incident, i.e., 17.01.2013. The Trial\n\nCourt also observed that the witnesses stated her age at 8 years only in\n\ntheir approximation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_75\">12.2.   Thus, the Trial Court concluded that the deceased was 7½ years\n\nof age at the time of incident and she was suffering from 70% physical\n\ndisablement and was also mentally retarded.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_76\">Deceased last seen with the appellant\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_77\">13.     The Trial Court, thereafter, took up for consideration the question\n\nof kidnapping of the deceased girl and referred to the testimony of PW-1\n\nKamla, PW-2 Dharam Das, PW-3 Madan Lal, PW-17 Dinesh Bhatia as\n\nalso that of PW-12 Ranjeet Singh and PW-5 Maniraj and held proved the\n\nfacts that the appellant kidnapped the deceased from the lawful\n\nguardianship of her parents with intent to secretly and wrongly confine\n\nher; and that the deceased was last seen with the appellant.\n\nDiscoveries on the information of appellant\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">                                     34</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_78\">\f14.    Moving on with the chain of circumstances, the Trial Court referred\n\nto the facts emanating from the statements of PW-2 Dharam Das and\n\nPW-3 Madan Lal that: a) the appellant was found at about 2:00 a.m. at\n\nthe bus stand with bloodstained clothes; b) the appellant disclosed that\n\nthe dead body of the victim was lying at Kamal Talai; and c) the appellant\n\ngot recovered the dead body at Kamal Talai. The Trial Court also referred\n\nto the testimony of PW-20 Ganesh Nath as regards arrest of the appellant\n\nand the disclosure statement made by him (Ex. P-40) whereupon the\n\ndead body was recovered at Kamal Talai. Thus, the Trial Court held\n\nproved the basic facts that the appellant was arrested after about 7½\n\nhours of his kidnapping the victim girl; the clothes worn by him were\n\nbloodstained, which were seized and sealed; and after about 1½ hours of\n\nhis arrest, the dead body of the victim girl was recovered at the disclosure\n\nand information of the appellant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_79\">15.

The witness has also expressed that vagina of the\n       deceased was ruptured leading to the conclusion that rape was\n       committed on her in a beastly and merciless manner. The said\n       statements of witnesses were confirmed by post-mortem report\n       (Exhibit – P35) prepared by the Medical Board.”\n\nReport of FSL\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_83\">17.    The Trial Court also referred to the other evidence on record\n\nestablishing the collection of samples and proper forwarding of the same\n\nto the FSL. The Trial Court further referred to the linking evidence,\n\nincluding the additional statement of PW-1 Kamla, as regards the clothing\n\nof her deceased daughter. Thereafter, the Trial Court referred to the FSL\n\nreport (Ex. P-51) wherein it was found that the DNA profile of blood\n\ncollected from the person and clothing of the deceased matched with the\n\nDNA profile of blood found on the coat, pant and shirt of the appellant as\n\nalso that found on the motorcycle. The facts established by this\n\nsubstantial piece of evidence and the conclusions deducible therefrom\n\nwere found by the Trial Court as follows: -\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">       “Thus from the said D.N.A. test, the D.N.A. profile obtained from\n       the coat (Exhibit No.1), pant (Exhibit No.2) and shirt (Exhibit No.3)\n       and from the Pajami of the prosecutrix (Exhibit No.5), blood\n       sample taken from the motorcycle of the accused (Exhibit No.6),\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">                                      36</span>\n\f        frock of the prosecutrix (Exhibit No.8), vaginal swab of the\n        prosecutrix (Exhibit No.12) and vaginal smear (Exhibit No.13) are\n        matching with D.N.A. profile of blood sample obtained from the\n        prosecutrix (Exhibit No.14). Meaning thereby, blood found on coat,\n        pant and shirt worn by the accused at the time of incident, which\n        were seized at the time of arrest and that found on the motorcycle\n        used by the accused at the time of incident, is matching with\n        D.N.A. profile of blood sample of the prosecutrix. From this cogent\n        circumstantial evidence, the only conclusion is that with intention\n        to secretly and wrongfully confine the prosecutrix, only the\n        accused kidnapped her and took her to a secluded place and\n        committed rape on her and murdered her by causing injuries.”\n                                                          (emphasis supplied)\nDefence contentions rejected\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_84\">18.     The assertion of the appellant that he was falsely implicated in the\n\nmatter was not accepted by the Trial Court, since he did neither provide\n\nany reason for his false implication nor made any such suggestion to the\n\nprosecution witnesses. The Trial Court also dealt with every submission\n\nmade on behalf of the appellant by the defence counsel and rejected the\n\nsame, as noticed infra.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_85\">18.1.   It was contended that as per PW-1 Kamla, she had not stated the\n\nname of appellant at the time of giving the initial report. With reference to\n\nthe timing of report as also the statement of PW-3 Madan Lal, the Trial\n\nCourt found that such a contention was totally baseless and a particular\n\nline in the statement of PW-1 Kamla occurred only because of her\n\nignorance about the meaning of words. It was also found that in the report\n\n(Ex. P-1), the particulars were clearly stated that the appellant was\n\npreviously known to them. Another contention that the parents and other\n\nrelatives of the deceased did not raise alarm at the time of kidnapping of\n\nthe girl was also found baseless with reference to the facts of the case\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">                                      37</span>\n\fand the statement of PW-1 Kamla. Even this was argued that the FIR was\n\nlodged after some delay but the Court found, with reference to the time of\n\nkidnapping and the distance of police station, that there was no such\n\ndelay in lodging the FIR. It was further argued that there was discrepancy\n\nin the colour of motorcycle as stated by PW-1 Kamla (sky-blue colour)\n\nand as stated by PW-17 Dinesh Bhatia (green colour). The Court found\n\nthat the recovered motorcycle was green in colour and bloodstains of\n\ndeceased were found on the same. Thus, such discrepancy of colour was\n\nof no effect. Another contention was that the place of arrest was not\n\nstated in Ex. P-5. The Trial Court found that the place of arrest was\n\nmentioned as Police Station Kankroli and it was not of any effect on the\n\nsubstance of the prosecution case. Similarly, the attempts on the part of\n\nthe defence to suggest some minor contradictions, about how many\n\npersons were available at the time of kidnapping of the child or whether\n\nshe was wearing slippers or not and the contention that the main\n\nwitnesses were all interested persons, were rejected by the Trial Court,\n\nbeing of no substance. Further, the questions sought to be raised about\n\nthe presence of witnesses of seizure and recovery etc. were also found\n\nbaseless and were rejected. An argument was also raised that the place\n\nof recovery of the dead body, i.e., Kamal Talai, was on the public way\n\nwhere anybody could leave the dead body. The Trial Court rejected this\n\ncontention too, with reference to the fact that immediately after the\n\nincident, the dead body was recovered at the instance of the appellant\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">                                   38</span>\n\fand he had failed to show any other reason of his knowledge about the\n\nlocation of dead body. It was also argued that the house of one Manoj\n\nwas shown near the place of incident but he was not examined and that\n\nthe registration certificate of the motorcycle was also not produced. The\n\nTrial Court found that the Manoj was not even remotely related with the\n\nmatter nor was the owner of the motorcycle. It was also observed that, in\n\nany case, such minor shortcomings in the investigation were of no\n\nassistance to the accused. It was further argued on behalf of the\n\nappellant that PW-12 Ranjeet Singh had not stated the registration\n\nnumber of the motorcycle; that according to PW-1 Kamla, she came to\n\nknow at about 12:30 in the night that the appellant was found but the time\n\nof arrest was shown at 2:00 a.m.; that no other injury except one on knee\n\nwas found on the body of the appellant; that the blood group was not\n\nestablished; and that PW-25 Umesh Ojha stated the colour of the skirt of\n\ndeceased as red with yellow dots but PW-1 Kamla stated that the dots\n\nwere of white colour. All these hair-splitting arguments were noticed and\n\nrejected by the Trial Court for being of no substance and having no\n\nmaterial bearing on the cogent and convincing evidence led by the\n\nprosecution. Even the admissibility of FSL report was also questioned but\n\nthis contention was rejected by the Trial Court with reference to <a href=\"/doc/692331/\" id=\"a_34\">Section\n\n293</a> CrPC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_86\">18.2.   The aforementioned consideration of the contentions urged on\n\nbehalf of the appellant by the Trial Court is to indicate the nature of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">                                   39</span>\n\fextensive arguments advanced on behalf of the accused-appellant in the\n\nTrial Court. As shall be noticed hereafter later, this feature coupled with in-\n\ndepth cross-examination of each and every prosecution witness, is of\n\nmaterial bearing on one of the contentions urged before us about want of\n\nproper legal assistance to the appellant in the Trial Court.\n\nChain of circumstances complete\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_87\">19.    Since there were no witnesses to the crime of rape and murder\n\nand it had been a case of circumstantial evidence, after the above-noted\n\ndiscussion, the Trial Court held that prosecution had been successful in\n\nestablishing the chain of circumstances linking the appellant with the\n\ncrime in such a manner that no other conclusion except that of his guilt\n\nwas possible. The Court held, inter alia, as under: -\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">           “On the basis of aforesaid discussion and analysis, the\n       prosecution has been fully successful in proving beyond doubt that\n       near about 6.30 p.m. on 17.01.2013, the accused with\n       premeditated criminal mentality kidnapped, with intention to\n       secretly and wrongfully confine the 7½ years old 70 per cent\n       mentally disabled, innocent, helpless, meek handicapped daughter\n       of complainant Kamla, by making her to sit on motorcycle in broad\n       day light in presence of her parents, grandfather and uncle, taking\n       unfair advantage of her natural abnormality, physical and mental\n       disability and by tempting her with food stuff, from Housing Board\n       within jurisdiction of Police Station Kankroli, District- Rajsamand;\n       and took her to a lonely place near crematorium on 50 feet road\n       towards Dhoinda, in Kankroli with premeditated intention of\n       committing rape on her kidnapped her; and thereafter, in order to\n       enhance his beastliness and inhumanity, he consumed beer and\n       then in a brutal manner, while scratching the body of an innocent\n       girl child, crossed the height of ignobility by committing rape on her\n       in extremely heinous manner; and murdered here by causing\n       multiple simple and grave injuries on her body in extremely\n       barbaric manner. Moreover, it is also proved that the accused\n       committed the offence of aggravated penetrative sexual assault by\n       causing grievous hurt and bodily harm to the deceased while\n       committing penetrative sexual assault.\n</blockquote>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">                                       40</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">\f            Therefore, after aforesaid entire discussion, the prosecution\n         has been found successful in proving the offence charged against\n         accused Manoj Pratap Singh under <a href=\"/doc/619940/\" id=\"a_35\">Sections 363</a>, <a href=\"/doc/886598/\" id=\"a_36\">365</a>, <a href=\"/doc/334057/\" id=\"a_37\">376(2)(f)</a>,\n         <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_38\">302</a> I.P.C. and under <a href=\"/doc/183539218/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 6</a> Protection of Children from Sexual\n         Offences Act, 2012, beyond reasonable doubt.

Thus, in the overall appreciation of the evidence on record and the\n\nsurrounding factors, the Trial Court was satisfied that the prosecution had\n\nsuccessfully substantiated its case beyond reasonable doubt and\n\naccordingly, convicted the appellant of offences under <a href=\"/doc/619940/\" id=\"a_45\">Sections 363</a>, <a href=\"/doc/886598/\" id=\"a_46\">365</a>,\n\n<a href=\"/doc/334057/\" id=\"a_47\">376(2)(f)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_48\">302</a> IPC and <a href=\"/doc/183539218/\" id=\"a_49\">Section 6</a> POCSO by its judgment dated\n\n28.09.2013.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_89\">Death sentence by the Trial Court\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_90\">21.      After having recorded the conviction as aforesaid, the Trial Court\n\ntook up the matter three clear days later, i.e., on 01.10.2013 and heard\n\nthe arguments on the question of sentencing. The burning question\n\nbefore the Trial Court was about the punishment to be awarded for the\n\nmajor offences of rape and murder of a seven-and-a-half-year-old girl\n\nchild.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_91\">21.1.    Having heard learned Public Prosecutor for the State as also\n\nlearned amicus curiae for the accused-appellant, the Trial Court took\n\nnote of the principles enunciated in various decisions of this Court; and\n\nexamined the aggravating factors on record, particularly those relating to\n\nthe gruesome nature of the crime as also the mitigating factors projected\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">                                      41</span>\n\fon behalf of the accused-appellant that it was his first offence; that he was\n\n28 years of age; that he was a married person with an 8-year-old\n\ndaughter; and that his family including old parents was dependant on him.\n\nHaving examined all the relevant facts and factors, the Trial Court formed\n\nthe opinion that a lenient view could not be taken looking to the nature of\n\nthe crime; and, taking the case in ‘rarest of rare’ category, found it just\n\nand appropriate to award death sentence for the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_50\">Section\n\n302</a> IPC. The Trial Court also awarded other punishments, as noticed\n\nhereinbefore.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_92\">21.2.   A few of the relevant observations of the Trial Court with reference\n\nto the decisions of this Court and in its appreciation of aggravating and\n\nmitigating circumstances before forming the opinion in favour of awarding\n\ndeath sentence could be usefully extracted as under: -\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">              “It is true that in homicidal offence, life sentence is a rule and\n        death sentence is an exception. Death sentence must be imposed\n        only when life imprisonment appears to be an altogether\n        inadequate punishment having regard to the relevant\n        circumstances of the crime. This point should also be considered\n        whether there is anything abnormal to award death sentence in\n        the offence for which life sentence could be awarded? Even after\n        considering all the important circumstances favouring an accused,\n        the circumstances of the offence should be such that there be no\n        option but to award death sentence. Death sentence should not be\n        awarded except in the most serious criminal cases. Before\n        choosing the substitute of death sentence, the circumstances of\n        offence and accused should be taken into consideration. When\n        any helpless, innocent girl is murdered and the accused is in a\n        position to dominate her, then it will be proper to award him death\n        sentence. A Judge should prudently and carefully determine the\n        proportional and justified punishment for the accomplishment of\n        the objectives as per the sentencing provided by law for serious\n        offences. If, without any provocation and with cool mind, a girl is\n        kidnapped, raped and brutally murdered and the murder is so\n        heinous which not only hurts judicial sensitivity but also shocks the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">                                         42</span>\n\fpure conscience of society, death sentence will be the only justice\nin such a case.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">     ***                ***                  ***\n      As it has been mentioned earlier that prosecution has clearly\nproved against the accused with direct &amp; circumstantial, cogent,\nconclusive, incontrovertible evidence that on 17.01.2013 at about\n6:30 p.m., accused Manoj Pratap Singh son of Surendra Pratap\nSingh, caste Rajput, aged 28 years, resident of Basantpur, Police\nStation Gugli, District Maharajganj (Uttar Pradesh) kidnapped a\n7½ year old 70% physically disabled, retarded, helpless, weak girl\nfrom the custody of her parents without their permission in broad\nday-light and committed rape on her in a brutal manner after\ntaking her to a lonely place. During commission of rape, the\naccused caused multiple simple &amp; grave injuries on the body of\nthat helpless innocent girl in a cruel manner. The injuries\nmentioned in the oral evidence of Medical Jurist and in post-\nmortem report (Exhibit P-35) were found on the body of deceased.\nMultiple abrasions, contusions and wounds were found on the\nhead, ears, jaw, cheeks, around neck, both the shoulders, chest,\nback, around frontal part below umbilicus, thighs &amp; knees of\ndeceased. Hymen of vagina of deceased was found to be having\nrecent signs of ruptures; 2/3rd lower part of vagina of deceased\nand posterior and lateral side were found completely torn; the\nouter skin in between vagina and anus of the deceased was\ncompletely torn; and blood clots were found all around the vagina.\nOn internal examination of deceased, multiple fractures were\nfound on her frontal occipital and tempo parietal regions due to the\ninjuries inflicted on head. In reply to the questions asked by the\nCourt, the Medical Jurist Dr. Manju Purohit (PW-14) has\nexpressed her expert opinion as under: -\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">     &quot;As per my expert opinion, forcible, brutal and heinous\n     rape was committed with an 8 year old innocent girl and\n     the deceased resisted the rape and whosoever\n     committed rape on her, had behaved in extremely brutal\n     and heinous manner because of which various simple\n     and serious injuries were inflicted on the body of the\n     deceased and she succumbed to the injuries found on\n     her body. The vagina of deceased having been found in\n     torn condition, the only inference is rape had been\n     committed on her in heinous and brutal manner&quot;.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_93\">      No evidence is available on record in support of the\narguments advanced on behalf of accused. Even if these\nstatements of accused are taken to be true for the sake of\narguments that he is married and father of 8 year old daughter and\nhe is the only son of his old parents, then too, on the basis of such\ncircumstances he does not deserve lenient view or sympathy.\nRather in the case in hand, no such circumstances are present in\nfavour of the accused on the basis of which it would be justified to\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">                               43</span>\n\f        have sympathy or leniency for him while passing order of sentence\n        for the commission of the charged offence.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_94\">              In the aforesaid facts and circumstances, in my humble\n        opinion, the accused committed rape on deceased heinously and\n        brutally at a lonely place after kidnapping her intentionally with\n        cool mind without any provocation. Thereafter, in the same\n        sequence, the deceased has been brutally murdered by causing\n        injuries on her body in a very inhumane, merciless and heinous\n        manner. The act of accused against humanity falls within the\n        purview of the rarest of the rare case for being lowest, extreme,\n        most brutal, merciless and heinous murder case for which, it is\n        obligatory to punish the accused with death sentence for securing\n        justice.”\n\nHigh Court confirmed the death sentence awarded to the appellant\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_95\">22.     As noticed, this case came up before the High Court on two\n\ncounts, viz., the death sentence submitted for confirmation and the\n\nappeal against conviction and sentence preferred by the appellant. The\n\nHigh Court reappreciated the material placed on record and, in its\n\ncommon judgment and order dated 29.05.2015, upheld the decision of\n\nthe Trial Court in convicting the appellant of the aforementioned offences\n\nand sentencing him to death for the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 302</a> IPC.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_96\">23.     The High Court examined the statement of PW-1 Kamla, which\n\nhad been corroborated by PW-2 Dharam Das, PW-3 Madan Lal and PW-\n\n5 Maniraj Singh, to note that the appellant came to the fruit and vegetable\n\nstand and took the deceased on his motorcycle towards Somnath\n\nChauraha; and that despite people in the locality chasing the motorcycle,\n\nthe appellant could not be located.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_97\">23.1.   The High Court found that PW-6 Khem Chand had duly proved\n\nEx. P-3 (memo of inspection of place of incident and site map) and Ex. P-\n\n8 (panchayatnama of the dead body of the deceased); and that he had\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">                               44</span>\n\faccompanied PW-2 and PW-3 when body of the deceased was recovered\n\npursuant to the disclosure statement of the appellant, who led them to the\n\nlocation of the body. The factum of recovery of the motorcycle used by the\n\nappellant and other articles was also found proved by the statements of\n\nPW-7 Kuldeep Singh and PW-8 Ajay Singh.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_98\">23.2.   The High Court laid emphasis on the statements of PW-14 Dr.\n\nManju Purohit, PW-15 Dr. Kailash Chand and PW-21 Dr. Chetna\n\nVaishnav as also on the post-mortem report (Ex. P-35) to find that the\n\ndeceased had been subjected to great cruelty at the time of commission\n\nof the crimes of rape and murder. The High Court, thereafter, examined\n\nthe FSL’s report on DNA Examination (Ex. P-51) to find that the samples\n\nof blood on the articles recovered from the appellant matched the\n\nsamples of the blood taken from the deceased. The findings of the High\n\nCourt in this regard could be reproduced as under: -\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">         “The D.N.A. Report which is Ex.P. 51 on the record, shows that\n        the same D.N.A. of female profile, namely of the deceased was\n        obtained from Ex.1 coat, Ex.2 pant, Ex.3 shirt, Ex.4 underwear.\n        Also to be noted is the statement of the investigating officer that\n        when the accused was apprehended he had bloodstains on his\n        clothing and the same were sent for DNA examination. The\n        matching of the blood group gains signification in such a\n        circumstance. The incriminating articles, namely, the clothes and\n        the blood group matching is an important circumstance showing\n        complicity of the appellant in the crime in question.”\n                                                          (emphasis supplied)\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_99\">24.     Having thus examined and analysed the evidence on record, the\n\nHigh Court found that the prosecution had been successful in establishing\n\nthe chain of circumstances conclusively linking the appellant with the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">                                      45</span>\n\fcrime, while ruling out any other hypothesis. The High Court summed up\n\nits findings and conclusion as follows: -\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">         “21. Taking all the evidence into account, we are of the opinion\n         that the circumstances which have been clearly established are:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">         that the appellant was seen taking the deceased on his\n         motorcycle; that the appellant had led to discovery of the dead\n         body of the deceased, the place where he kept his motorcycle\n         which had bloodstains of the deceased on it; at his instance the\n         stone smeared with blood was recovered 9; that the medical report\n         clearly indicates about the injuries sustained by the deceased on\n         her body; that the injuries sustained on the private parts have\n         been stated by the doctor to have been caused by forcible sexual\n         intercourse; that the chemical analysis report links the accused\n         with the crime; that the appellant has not offered any explanation\n         with regard to the recovery made at his instance; other than a bald\n         statement that he was not guilty, the accused has not any\n         evidence either to discredit the prosecution witness or to establish\n         his innocence: and that nothing has been stated in his examination\n         under <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C that there was any justifiable reason to\n         implicate him in the crime in question. Thus, we find that each of\n         the incriminating circumstances has been clearly established and\n         the chain of events are conclusive in nature to exclude any other\n         kind of hypothesis, but the one proposed to be proved, and lead to\n         a definite conclusion that the crime was committed by the\n         accused.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">         22. Therefore, finding no infirmity in the judgment under challenge,\n         we affirm the judgment given by the learned trial Judge and\n         dismiss the appeal filed by the accused Manoj Pratap Singh.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_100\">                                                                    (emphasis supplied)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_101\">25.      Having affirmed the conviction of the appellant, the High Court\n\nproceeded to consider the question as to whether the death sentence\n\nawarded to the appellant required any interference.\n\n25.1.    It was sought to be argued on behalf of the appellant before the\n\nHigh Court that the case did not fall under the rarest of rare category; that\n\n\n9 The High Court appears to have gathered an impression that some ‘stone’ was recovered at\nthe instance of the appellant with reference to the memo dated 21.01.2013 (Ex. P-23) and\nstatements of PW-7 Kuldeep Singh and PW-8 Ajay Singh as also PW-25 Umesh Ojha, where\nthey indicated that the accused-appellant had shown the place of incident and hard gravelly\nsurface with stone whereupon did he smash the head of the victim while committing rape. It\ndoes not appear that any ‘stone’ was as such recovered and seized. However, this aspect is not\nof material bearing on the substance of the matter.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">                                             46</span><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_102\">\n\fthe mitigating circumstances operating in favour of the appellant should\n\nbe considered; and that a lenient view ought to be taken with regard to\n\nsentencing, since he was 28 years of age at the time of commission of\n\nthe crime and had a family comprising of a minor daughter, his wife and\n\nhis father dependent on him.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_103\">25.2.   The High Court took note of various leading decisions wherein this\n\nCourt has enunciated the principles to be applied in the matters of\n\nsentencing, particularly relating to the offences where death sentence\n\ncould also be awarded. The High Court took note of the facts of the\n\npresent case involving the heinous crime of brutal rape and murder of a\n\nyoung girl, who was below 8 years of age and was suffering from physical\n\nand mental disabilities. The High Court also observed that there was no\n\nelement of compassion on the part of the appellant, who brutally raped\n\nthe child and smashed her head; and that the conduct of the appellant\n\nwith brutal nature of the offence did not call for any leniency. The High\n\nCourt further took note of the submissions made on behalf of the\n\naccused-appellant about his being a young person and having a family to\n\nsupport but observed that these were not the mitigating circumstances in\n\nthis case which gives repulsions to the conscience of the Court and the\n\ncommunity. Hence, the High Court found that the present case was falling\n\nin the category of rarest of rare and proceeded to confirm the death\n\nsentence awarded to the appellant while observing as under: -\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\">        “32. In the case in hand, there are no aggravating circumstances\n        (sic) or mitigating circumstances put forth to award a lesser\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">                                     47</span>\n\f       punishment than what has been awarded by the Sessions Court.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_104\">       The accused after giving a chocolate to a young girl aged 8 years,\n       who not only was having permanent disability of 70% but also\n       having I.Q. of 50%, abducted her and took her away on a\n       motorcycle. Thereafter, he committed a heinous crime of not only\n       brutally raping her, but also hit her head against the silencer of the\n       motorcycle as well as with her stone causing her death. It is\n       evident from the statement made by the doctor who had\n       conducted the postmortem that the young deceased tried to resist\n       the rape but there was no compassion shown at all. The plea\n       raised by the learned counsel appearing for the accused that\n       leniency should be shown since the accused was a young man\n       with a family, cannot be said to be a mitigating circumstance at all.\n       The accused after brutally raping her, hit her head against the\n       motorcycle and then used a stone to smash her head and tried to\n       flee that very night itself. The heinous offence of brutal rape on a\n       helpless young girl followed by a cold-blooded murder and\n       calculated attempt to cover-up the said incident shocks and\n       repulses the conscience of this Court and the community. Placing\n       reliance upon the settled principles as enumerated by the Apex\n       Court in several judgments, this Court has no hesitation in holding\n       that this case falls within the category of rarest of rare cases and\n       upholds the judgment passed by the Sessions Court. In our\n       opinion, the judgment passed by the Sessions Court suffers from\n       no error.”\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_105\">       33. Therefore, the D. B.

Learned\n\ncounsel has also endeavoured to find faults or shortcomings in the\n\nevidence adduced by the prosecution; the main plank of submissions had\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">                                       48</span>\n\fbeen that the prosecution case is based on a weak chain of circumstantial\n\nevidence and the appellant is entitled to the benefit of ‘residual doubt’.\n\nThe learned counsel has also questioned the sentence awarded to the\n\nappellant with the submissions that in view of several mitigating factors, it\n\nwould not be justified to punish him with death.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_108\">26.1.   Learned senior counsel for the appellant has strenuously argued\n\nthat the investigation in this case had not been impartial and has raised\n\nquestions over investigation with the submissions that after finding the\n\nappellant at the bus stand, the police along with the father of deceased\n\n(PW-2), took him directly to the police station, recorded his confession\n\nand thereafter took him to the spot where the body of deceased was\n\nfound, instead of enquiring from him the whereabouts of the deceased.\n\nFurther, the unusual collecting of evidence against the appellant in\n\nrelation to other cases and overt reliance on personal opinion of doctors\n\nabout the manner of commission of offence, establishes that the\n\ninvestigation was not impartial, where final report was submitted within 12\n\ndays of the appellant’s arrest, even before receiving the DNA report.\n\n26.2.   Learned senior counsel has further contended that the trial was\n\nconducted in a hurried manner, where reasonable time to prepare for\n\nfacing charges was not afforded to the appellant and at least two months’\n\ntime should have been given for the purpose of perusal of final report. It\n\nhas also been contended that the appellant was not given the opportunity\n\nto meet his family members after arrest nor was he given proper\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">                                     49</span>\n\fopportunity to engage a counsel of his choice, thereby depriving him of\n\nhis constitutional right guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1293832/\" id=\"a_53\">Article 22(1)</a> of the Constitution\n\nof India. According to the learned counsel, an inexperienced counsel was\n\nappointed in legal aid, who failed to have any meeting or discussion with\n\nappellant in prison in order to formulate a better version of his defence in\n\ntrial; and the manner of cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses\n\nshows the absence of preparation of the counsel and his inexperience in\n\nconducting the defence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_109\">26.3.   While assailing the findings against the appellant on the basis of\n\nthe chain of circumstances, the learned senior counsel has referred to\n\ncertain aspects, which according to him, show the shortcomings and\n\nlacunae in the prosecution case. In this regard, learned counsel has\n\nsubmitted that the name of appellant was not mentioned in the missing\n\nperson report initially filed in this matter, as admitted by PW-1 and PW-3,\n\nthough the appellant was known to the family of the victim; and the said\n\ninitial missing person report is not on record. These factors, according to\n\nthe learned counsel, give rise to the possibility of the appellant being not\n\nthe culprit. The learned counsel has further submitted that the doctors\n\nPW-14, PW-15 and PW-21 unjustifiably used the expressions “brutal” and\n\n“inhuman” in their statements though they were only expected to depose\n\nabout the nature of injuries found on the body and the weapon/object\n\nlikely to have caused said injuries. According to the learned counsel,\n\nabsence of semen on the body of the victim as also in the vaginal swab\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">                                    50</span>\n\foperate against the theory of rape in this case. Yet further, learned\n\ncounsel has submitted that as per the account given by a number of\n\nwitnesses including eye-witnesses, there was rain, drizzling and storm at\n\nthe time of occurrence and the motorcycle used for kidnapping was kept\n\nin open space. In such a situation, even the possibility of bloodstains\n\nremaining on the metal surface of motorcycle is rare. Learned counsel for\n\nthe appellant has further argued that there is nothing on record to show\n\nthat the girl was mentally retarded; that the witnesses have only deposed\n\nthat she was feeble minded and even the certificate issued from school to\n\nprove her mental caliber cannot be relied upon because the person who\n\nissued such certificate was never examined.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_110\">26.3.1. According to the learned senior counsel for the appellant, the\n\naforesaid factors individually and cumulatively lead to the position that the\n\npresent one is a case of weak chain of circumstances and conviction of\n\nthe appellant remains unsustainable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_111\">26.4.   Again, with reference to the nature of evidence adduced in this\n\nmatter and asserting it to be a case of weak chain of circumstances, the\n\nlearned senior counsel has strenuously argued that in any case and at\n\nany rate, residual doubt remains about involvement of the appellant in\n\ncommission of the crime and he is entitled to the benefit thereof.\n\n26.4.1. In this line of submissions, learned senior counsel for the\n\nappellant has also endeavoured to argue that the injuries found on the\n\nbody of the deceased were only bruises and abrasions, apart from the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">                                     51</span>\n\finjury on the head; and in the context of the deposition of PW-21 that the\n\ndeath might have been caused as a result of rape, it could be deduced\n\nthat causing of death was not the intention of the appellant. According to\n\nthe learned counsel, only the knowledge of consequence of act may be\n\nattributed but residual doubt does exist about absolute certainty of the\n\nintention to commit the offence in a brutal manner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_112\">26.5.   Learned counsel has also submitted that the accused of an\n\noffence of rape cannot be convicted under both POCSO and <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_54\">IPC</a> as per\n\n<a href=\"/doc/174867083/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 42</a> of POCSO. It can only be under any one of the enactments\n\nthat Court could impose maximum punishment provided therein and\n\nhence, life sentence awarded by the Trial Court for the offence under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_56\">Section 376</a> IPC as also under <a href=\"/doc/183539218/\" id=\"a_57\">Section 6</a> POCSO is unsustainable in law.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_113\">27.     As regards the question of sentence, learned senior counsel for\n\nthe appellant has contended that even when the charge is proved beyond\n\nreasonable doubt but is based on certain circumstances rather than\n\nabsolute proof, the benefit of residual doubt ought to be given to the\n\naccused and capital sentence should not be awarded. According to the\n\nlearned counsel, even if this case at all warrants conviction, it doesn’t\n\nwarrant the punishment of death because it may be a rare case but, is not\n\nrarest of rare.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_114\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"77000502\" id=\"span_57\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"117562185\" id=\"span_58\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"28102290\" id=\"span_59\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"170583861\" id=\"span_60\">27.1.   Learned senior counsel for the appellant, while adverting to the\n\nmitigating factors, has submitted that there is nothing on record to show\n\nthat the appellant has become a menace to the society or cannot be\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">                                    52</span>\n\freformed. It has also been highlighted that the appellant was only about\n\n28 years of age when the FIR was registered against him; that he comes\n\nfrom a poor economic background; and that he has a family with wife, 8-\n\nyear-old daughter and 70-year-old father to look after. With reference to\n\nthese factors and the overall circumstances, learned counsel would argue\n\nthat the appellant does not deserve death and the sentence as awarded\n\nin this matter deserves to be commuted to that of imprisonment for life.\n\n27.2.   Learned senior counsel for the appellant, in support of his plea\n\nagainst the death sentence, has referred to several decisions of this Court\n\nwherein death sentence was altered/commuted to other sentence,\n\nincluding those in <a href=\"/doc/170583861/\" id=\"a_58\">Viran Gyanlal Rajput v. State of Maharashtra</a>: (2019)\n\n2 SCC 311; <a href=\"/doc/28102290/\" id=\"a_59\">Babasaheb Maruti Kamble v. State of Maharashtra</a>: (2019)\n\n13 SCC 640; <a href=\"/doc/117562185/\" id=\"a_60\">Nand Kishore v. State of Madhya Pradesh</a>: (2019) 16\n\nSCC 278; and <a href=\"/doc/77000502/\" id=\"a_61\">Central Bureau of Investigation v. Sakru Mahagu\n\nBinjewar &amp; Ors.</a>: (2019) 20 SCC 102.</span></span></span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_115\">28.     Per contra, Dr. Manish Singhvi, learned senior counsel appearing\n\nfor the respondent-State has duly opposed the submissions made on\n\nbehalf of the appellant with reference to the evidence on record and the\n\nfindings recorded by the Trial Court and the High Court.\n\n28.1.   Learned senior counsel for the respondent-State has contended\n\nthat the investigation has been carried out in the present matter with due\n\nattention to necessary details; and there had not been any shortcoming\n\naffecting the substance of the case. In relation to the questions of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">                                    53</span>\n\fprocedural safeguards in the trial and opportunity to the accused-\n\nappellant to defend himself, learned counsel for the respondent has\n\nsubmitted that the appellant never asked for a counsel of his choice and it\n\nwas through the legal aid that a defence counsel was appointed, who\n\npossessed sufficient experience of about 9 years. Moreover, the counsel\n\nso appointed made qualitative efforts to conduct the trial and examination\n\nof witnesses with best of his ability, who rather deserves admiration for\n\nthe efforts made by him. Hence, it cannot be said that the accused-\n\nappellant was deprived of proper legal assistance and proper opportunity\n\nto defend himself.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_116\">28.2.   Learned senior counsel for the respondent would submit that the\n\nevidence adduced by mother, father and maternal grandfather of the\n\ndeceased (PW-1, PW-2 and PW-3 respectively), is creditworthy and\n\nunimpeachable; and the same is duly corroborated by PW-5 Maniraj\n\nSingh, PW-12 Ranjeet Singh and PW-17 Dinesh Bhatia, who were\n\nindependent witnesses of the relevant facts, particularly those relating to\n\nthe kidnapping of the victim girl from the vending cart of her parents.\n\nThus, according to the learned counsel, the fact that the deceased was\n\nlast seen with the appellant is established beyond any doubt. In relation to\n\nthe argument that the name of appellant was not mentioned in the\n\nmissing person report, learned counsel for the respondent would submit\n\nthat this contention is not correct inasmuch as the name of the appellant\n\nwas indeed mentioned in the missing report (Ex. P-1) lodged by PW-1 at\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">                                    54</span>\n\f8:15 p.m., though it was mentioned as “Manoj Singh” instead of “Manoj\n\nPratap Singh”; and the FIR (Ex. P-2), which was registered on the basis\n\nof the said report also carries the name of appellant. Learned counsel for\n\nthe respondent would further submit that by way of the documents\n\navailable on record, i.e., Exs. P-11, P-12 and P-13 and the evidence of\n\nPW-18 Dr. Narendra Paliwal, it is proved beyond doubt that the deceased\n\nwas a mentally and physically disadvantaged child, who was also\n\nsuffering from spastic palsy, i.e., uncontrolled movement of muscles and\n\njoints.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_117\">28.3.     Learned senior counsel for the respondent-State has referred to\n\nthe extensive injuries pointed out in the post-mortem report (Ex. P-35)\n\nand has submitted that such injuries prove beyond any doubt that the\n\ndeceased was subjected to brutal rape and was murdered mercilessly, as\n\nnoticeable from the injuries on the occipital and parietal region of the\n\nhead of the deceased and as concluded by the doctors of Medical Board\n\nthat the she died due to the injuries on her head. Learned counsel has\n\nalso strongly relied upon the FSL’s report on DNA Examination (Ex. P-51)\n\nto submit that the matching of DNA profile of the blood sample taken from\n\nthe body of the deceased with that of the blood samples taken from\n\nclothing of the appellant as also with the blood samples taken from the\n\nmotorcycle used in the crime, is a rather clinching piece of evidence that\n\nleaves nothing to doubt that the brutal rape and murder of the deceased\n\ncould only be attributed to the appellant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_118\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_64\">                                     55</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_119\">\f29.     Learned senior counsel for respondent has further submitted that\n\nthere was no infraction of the requirements of <a href=\"/doc/729076/\" id=\"a_62\">Section 235(2)</a> CrPC, as a\n\nsufficient time gap of 3 days was observed by the Trial Court between the\n\ndate of conviction and the date of awarding death sentence, which too\n\nwas awarded only after duly hearing the appellant, duly appreciating all\n\nthe material factors and circumstances, and duly recording special\n\nreasons which take the present case into the rarest of rare category.\n\n29.1.   The learned senior counsel for the respondent, while highlighting\n\nthe aggravating circumstances of this case, has submitted that the victim\n\nwas a feeble minded and physically challenged girl; and when the\n\nappellant was known to the victim, there was an element of betrayal of\n\ntrust. The learned counsel would also refer to the fact that the victim girl\n\nwas lured by way of first offering chocolates, to submit that the entire\n\nmodus operandi of the appellant was pre-meditated, leading to brutal\n\nrape and murder of the hapless girl. The learned counsel has further\n\nsubmitted that the extensive injuries on the private parts of the victim\n\nwere caused in a most diabolical and barbaric manner, which shows the\n\nghastly nature of crime; and the medical expert evidence has established\n\nthat the deceased died due to the injuries caused on her head. Thus, the\n\nappellant not only committed rape in a ghastly manner but also clubbed\n\nthe victim to death by brutal smashing of her head. According to the\n\nlearned counsel, on the facts of this case, the circumstances as referred\n\non behalf of the appellant could hardly be said to be sufficiently mitigating\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_65\">                                     56</span>\n\fthe aggravated crime committed by the appellant. Thus, there are no\n\nmitigating circumstances in this case and nature of crime is such that it\n\nshocks the collective conscience of society and shakes the very\n\nfoundation of civilization; and in this case, awarding of death sentence is\n\nimmensely justified.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_120\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1312651\" id=\"span_66\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"545301\" id=\"span_67\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"307021\" id=\"span_68\">29.2.   Learned senior counsel for the respondent-State has cited various\n\ndecisions in relation to the question concerning death sentence and the\n\nprinciples evolved by the Courts in that regard, including the requirement\n\nof special reasons and rarest of rare doctrine, as elucidated in the case of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/307021/\" id=\"a_63\">Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab</a>: (1980) 2 SCC 684; the requirement of\n\nbalance sheet of aggravating and mitigating circumstances, as explained\n\nin the case of <a href=\"/doc/545301/\" id=\"a_64\">Machhi Singh &amp; Ors. v. State of Punjab</a>: (1983) 3 SCC\n\n470; and the crime and criminal test, as elaborated in <a href=\"/doc/1312651/\" id=\"a_65\">Santosh Kumar\n\nSatishbhushan Bariyar v. State of Maharashtra</a>: (2009) 6 SCC 498.\n\n29.3.   As regards the contentions urged on behalf of the appellant\n\ninvoking the doctrine of ‘residual doubt’, learned senior counsel for the\n\nrespondent-State    has   contended      that   our   criminal   jurisprudence\n\nrecognises the requirement of ‘proof beyond reasonable doubt’ to hold\n\nany accused guilty; and any lingering doubt leads to the ‘benefit of doubt’\n\nto the accused. Thus, there ought not be any uncertainty in coming to the\n\nconclusion of guilt of the accused. According to the learned counsel, in\n\nthe face of such stringent requirements of proof beyond reasonable\n\ndoubt, there is no place for any ‘residual doubt’ after the finding of guilt\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_69\">                                    57</span>\n\fand consequential conviction of the accused.</span></span></span> The learned counsel has\n\ncontended that the concept of ‘residual doubt’ has not been found\n\napplicable in our country; and has referred to the decision of this Court in\n\nShatrughna Baban Meshram v. State of Maharashtra: (2021) 1 SCC\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_121\">596.\n\n29.4.   While supporting the death sentence in the present case, learned\n\nsenior counsel for the respondent-State has submitted that the recurrent\n\nunderlying principles are that in the cases of rape and murder of a girl\n\nchild, if death occurs due to rape alone, then death sentence is normally\n\nnot awarded but, if rape is followed by separate act of murder, death\n\nsentence is countenanced, like the present case where, apart from\n\ngruesome rape, the girl was done to death by causing horrific injuries on\n\nher head. According to the learned counsel, the present case is similar\n\nand akin to the cases where death sentence has been awarded and\n\nmaintained. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"176493192\" id=\"span_70\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"598152\" id=\"span_71\">In this regard, the learned counsel has particularly referred to\n\nthe decision in <a href=\"/doc/598152/\" id=\"a_66\">Kamta Tiwari v. State of M.P.</a>: (1996) 6 SCC 250 as also\n\ntwo elaborate decisions in <a href=\"/doc/176493192/\" id=\"a_67\">Vasanta Sampat Dupare v. State of\n\nMaharashtra</a> where, in the case of rape and murder of a four-year-old girl\n\nchild, death sentence was affirmed by this Court while dismissing the\n\nmain appeals [reported as (2015) 1 SCC 253] and then, the review\n\npetitions were also dismissed with the finding that the aggravating\n\ncircumstances were outweighing the alleged mitigating circumstances\n\n[reported as (2017) 6 SCC 631].</span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_122\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_72\">                                    58</span>\n\f29.5.   Learned counsel for respondent has also submitted in the\n\nalternative that if at all death penalty is not affirmed by this Court, the\n\nappellant ought to remain behind the bars for the remainder of his life\n\nwithout any kind of remission, as per the course adopted by this Court in\n\nthe case of <a href=\"/doc/989335/\" id=\"a_68\">Swamy Shraddananda (2) v. State of Karnataka</a>: (2008) 13\n\nSCC 767.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_123\">30.     Apart from the factors relating to the heinous nature of crime\n\ncommitted by the appellant, learned counsel for the respondent, in his\n\nwritten submissions, has pointed out other startling facts leading to further\n\naggravating circumstances in view of the conduct of the appellant post-\n\nconviction. These circumstances, as regards post-conviction conduct of\n\nthe appellant, have been stated as under: -\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\">        “B.

The fundamental fact, as held proved\n\nagainst the appellant is that the victim, a seven-and-a-half-year old\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_75\">                                    61</span>\n\fmentally and physically challenged girl, was lastly seen in the company of\n\nthe appellant when he lured her and took her along with himself on his\n\nmotorcycle. The other significant fact, as held proved, is that the dead\n\nbody of the victim girl, her clothing, and the motorcycle used in the crime\n\nwere recovered at a faraway place at the instance of the appellant.\n\nCoupled with these two aspects are the factors that there were\n\nbloodstains on the clothes of the appellant when he was found at the bus\n\nstand after about 7½ hours of the incident of kidnapping and that\n\nbloodstains were also found on the body of the motorcycle; and the DNA\n\nprofile obtained from these bloodstains matched with the DNA profile of\n\nthe blood sample of the victim girl. Added to these had been the\n\ncircumstance that the appellant failed to explain his whereabouts since he\n\nwas last seen with the victim girl as also about his knowledge of the\n\nlocation of her dead body. These facts and factors, taken together with\n\nthe medical evidence that there were several injuries all over the body of\n\nthe victim girl including gruesome injuries on her private parts and horrific\n\ninjuries on her head, are said to be of a complete chain of circumstances,\n\nleading to the conclusion on the guilt of the appellant in relation to the\n\noffences of kidnapping, rape and murder.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_130\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"181505792\" id=\"span_76\">33.    As could be readily noticed, the concurrent findings leading to the\n\nappellant’s conviction have been challenged as if it were a matter of\n\nregular appeal; and as if inviting re-appreciation of entire evidence on its\n\ncontents as also its surrounding factors. However, we cannot lose sight of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_77\">                                     62</span>\n\fthe fact that the present one is a matter of concurrent findings of fact by\n\nthe Trial Court and the High Court. Though the parameters of examining\n\nthe matters in an appeal by special leave under <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_75\">Article 136</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India have been laid down repeatedly by this Court in\n\nseveral of the decisions but, having regard to the submissions made in\n\nthis case, we may usefully iterate what has been observed in the case of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/181505792/\" id=\"a_76\">Pappu v. The State of Uttar Pradesh</a>: Criminal Appeal Nos. 1097-1098\n\nof 2018 decided on 09.02.2022 wherein, after referring to <a href=\"/doc/1446285/\" id=\"a_77\">Articles 134</a>\n\nand <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_78\">136</a> of the Constitution of India and Section 2 of the Supreme Court\n\n(Enlargement of Criminal Appellate Jurisdiction) Act, 1970 as also with a\n\ndetailed reference to several of the relevant decisions10, this Court has\n\nsummed up the subtle but relevant distinction in the scope of a regular\n\nappeal and an appeal by special leave in the following words: -</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_50\">        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"489014\" id=\"span_78\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1922173\" id=\"span_79\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"786592\" id=\"span_80\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"743851\" id=\"span_81\">“20. In summation of what has been noticed hereinabove, it\n        is but clear that as against any judgment/final order or\n        sentence in a criminal proceeding of the High Court, regular\n        appeals to this Court are envisaged in relation to the\n        eventualities specified in <a href=\"/doc/1446285/\" id=\"a_79\">Article 134</a> of the Constitution of\n        India and <a href=\"/doc/127722677/\" id=\"a_80\">Section 2</a> of the Act of 1970. The present one is\n        not a matter covered thereunder and the present appeals\n        are by special leave in terms of <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_81\">Article 136</a> of the\n        Constitution of India. In such an appeal by special leave,\n        where the Trial Court and the High Court have concurrently\n        returned the findings of fact after appreciation of evidence,\n        each and every finding of fact cannot be contested nor such\n        an appeal could be dealt with as if another forum for\n        reappreciation of evidence. Of course, if the assessment by\n        the Trial Court and the High Court could be said to be\n        vitiated by any error of law or procedure or misreading of\n        evidence or in disregard to the norms of judicial process\n\n10 Like those in the cases of <a href=\"/doc/743851/\" id=\"a_82\">Pritam Singh v.

Tersely put, it is not a matter of regular appeal. This\n        Court would not interfere with the concurrent findings of fact\n        based on pure appreciation of evidence nor it is the scope of\n        these appeals that this Court would enter into reappreciation\n        of evidence so as to take a view different than that taken by\n        the Trial Court and approved by the High Court.”\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_132\">34.     Keeping the principles aforesaid in view, we may examine if the\n\nconcurrent findings call for any interreference while reiterating that\n\nwholesome reappreciation of evidence is not within the scope of these\n\nappeals, even though we have scanned through the entire evidence in\n\norder to appropriately deal with the rival submissions.\n\nProcedural questions relating to investigation and trial\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_133\">35.     Before dealing with the contentions relating to the evidence on\n\nrecord, we deem it appropriate to address the procedural aspects put in\n\nquestion by the learned counsel for the appellant, particularly relating to\n\nthe investigation and the trial in this matter.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_134\">35.1.   The contentions urged by learned counsel for the appellant\n\nagainst the process of investigation have only been noted to be rejected.\n\nThe chronology of the events and steps in the investigation leave nothing\n\nto doubt that the Investigating Officers of this case (the SHO PW-20\n\nGanesh Nath and the Circle Officer PW-25 Umesh Ojha) and other police\n\nofficers have indeed methodically discharged their duties. Rather than\n\nfinding faults or shortcomings in the investigation, we could only\n\nappreciate the thoroughness of investigation, where every step was\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_83\">                                         64</span>\n\fappropriately and punctually taken and all the relevant processes were\n\nmethodically documented; and where the charge-sheet was swiftly\n\npresented to the Court with all relevant particulars.\n\n35.2.    As per the evidence on record, the information referable to\n\nSection 27 of the Indian Evidence Act, 187211 as furnished by the\n\nappellant at 2:30 a.m. on 18.01.2013 was duly recorded by PW-20\n\nGanesh Nath (Ex. P-40). Thereafter, the appellant was taken to the\n\nlocation of the dead body of the victim girl and the same was recovered\n\nas per the said information furnished by the appellant. There is no\n\nsubstance in the contention against the process taken up by PW-20\n\nGanesh Nath after the arrest of the appellant. Similarly, there does not\n\nappear to be any unusual manner in which evidence against the appellant\n\nfor other cases was collected. As noticed, last one of the other cases\n\nagainst the appellant was that of theft of the very same motorcycle, which\n\nwas used in the present crime. The other thread of contentions against\n\nthe process of investigation, about placing reliance on the personal\n\nopinion of doctors, is very difficult to be appreciated. The doctors of the\n\nMedical Board were rather under bounden duty to state their opinion,\n\nparticularly as regards the nature and duration of injuries and the cause of\n\ndeath.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_135\">35.3.    The suggestions that the charge-sheet was filed within 12 days of\n\nhis arrest and even without receipt of DNA report and that the appellant\n\n\n11 Hereinafter also referred to as ‘the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_86\">Evidence Act</a>’.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_84\">                                               65</span>\n\fshould have been given more time to study the police report stand rather\n\nat conflict with the desirability of prompt proceedings by the investigating\n\nagency and also by the Trial Court in such matters. The constitutional\n\nguarantees of equality before law, protection of life and personal liberty,\n\nprotection in respect of conviction, and protection against the arrest and\n\ndetention, do not expand into a corresponding right with an accused\n\nperson to question the swiftness of investigation and expeditious\n\nproceedings of the trial or to suggest that he has to be tried at a pace of\n\nhis choice. It sounds rather preposterous that an accused would question\n\nthe trial proceedings only because of the pace maintained by the\n\nprosecution and the Trial Court so as to take the trial to its logical\n\nconclusion at the earliest. While rejecting the contentions urged on behalf\n\nof the appellant, we would rather observe that the speed and pace\n\nexpected in the cases like the present one, per force, require utmost\n\nexpedition by the investigating agency as also by the Trial Court.\n\n35.4.   The contention that the appellant was deprived of his right of\n\ndefence and he was given services of an inexperienced counsel remain\n\ntoo far-stretched and rather unjustified. Apart that no such grievance was\n\never suggested before the Trial Court or even before the High Court, we\n\nfind from the record that legal aid counsel was appointed at the request of\n\nthe appellant himself and in fact, the Trial Court proceeded with the\n\nmatter only after appointment of a counsel for the appellant. A perusal of\n\nthe record further makes it clear that the legal aid counsel left no stone\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_85\">                                    66</span>\n\funturned to defend the appellant and thoroughly cross-examined each\n\nand every witness to the minutest and minor details. He contested every\n\nproposition of the prosecution and even the application for recalling of\n\nPW-1 (only for the purpose of identification of the clothes of deceased,\n\nwhich were received later from FSL) was also thoroughly contested by\n\nhim by filing a reply and contending that the prosecution was trying to fill\n\nup a lacuna in their case. Hereinbefore, we have referred to the extensive\n\ncontentions urged on behalf of the accused-appellant by the legal aid\n\ncounsel, as dealt with by the Trial Court in its judgment dated\n\n28.09.201312.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_136\">Having examined the record, we find the criticism in this appeal against\n\nthe conduct of case by the legal aid counsel to be unwarranted and rather\n\nunfair. The said counsel had indeed faithfully discharged his duties and\n\nhad thoroughly defended the appellant. As regards the defence version, it\n\nhas not been shown if the appellant ever suggested to the counsel about\n\nhis desire to have one or more meetings with him or to confer with him\n\nabout any particular line of defence. We are constrained to observe that\n\nthe negative comments qua the said legal aid counsel cannot be\n\ncountenanced and raising of such contentions in this appeal is difficult to\n\nbe appreciated; these contentions are rejected in toto.\n\nConcurrent findings of fact: whether requiring interference?\n\n\n\n\n12 Vide paragraphs 18, 18.1 and 18.2 (supra).\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_86\">                                                67</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_137\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_138\">\f<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"882637\" id=\"span_87\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"13149785\" id=\"span_88\">36.     Moving on to the submissions assailing the findings on guilt of the\n\nappellant, we may reiterate that the present case is based on\n\ncircumstantial evidence where the Trial Court and the High Court have\n\nconcurrently recorded their findings that the prosecution has been able to\n\nsuccessfully establish the chain of circumstances leading to the\n\nunmistakable conclusion that the appellant is guilty of the offences of\n\nkidnapping, rape and murder of the victim girl. However, learned counsel\n\nfor the appellant has endeavoured to project certain so-called\n\nshortcomings and lacunae in the prosecution case. While dealing with\n\nsuch submissions, we may usefully take note of the basic principles\n\nrelating to a case based on circumstantial evidence.\n\n36.1.   The principles explained and enunciated in the case of <a href=\"/doc/13149785/\" id=\"a_87\">Sharad\n\nBirdhichand Sarda v. State of Maharashtra</a>: (1984) 4 SCC\n\n116 remain a guiding light for the Courts in regard to the proof of a case\n\nbased on circumstantial evidence, wherein this Court referred to the\n\ncelebrated decision in the case of <a href=\"/doc/882637/\" id=\"a_88\">Hanumant v. State of Madhya\n\nPradesh</a>.: AIR 1952 SC 343 and deduced five golden principles,\n\npanchsheel, of proving a case based on circumstantial evidence in the\n\nfollowing passages: -</span></span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_51\">        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"882637\" id=\"span_89\">“152............It may be useful to extract what Mahajan, J. has <a href=\"/doc/882637/\" id=\"a_89\">laid\n        down in</a> Hanumant case:</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_52\">             “It is well to remember that in cases where the evidence is\n             of a circumstantial nature, the circumstances from which\n             the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should in the first\n             instance be fully established, and all the facts so\n             established should be consistent only with the hypothesis\n             of the guilt of the accused. Again, the circumstances\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_90\">                                       68</span>\n\f      should be of a conclusive nature and tendency and they\n      should be such as to exclude every hypothesis but the one\n      proposed to be proved. In other words, there must be a\n      chain of evidence so far complete as not to leave any\n      reasonable ground for a conclusion consistent with the\n      innocence of the accused and it must be such as to show\n      that within all human probability the act must have been\n      done by the accused.”\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_53\">153. A close analysis of this decision would show that the following\nconditions must be fulfilled before a case against an accused\ncan be said to be fully established:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_54\">(1) the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be\ndrawn should be fully established.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_139\">        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1035123\" id=\"span_91\">It may be noted here that this Court indicated that the\ncircumstances concerned “must or should” and not “may be”\nestablished. There is not only a grammatical but a legal distinction\nbetween “may be proved” and “must be or should be proved” as\nwas held by this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1035123/\" id=\"a_90\">Shivaji Sahabrao Bobade v. State of\nMaharashtra</a> [(1973) 2 SCC 793] where the observations were\nmade:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_55\">      “Certainly, it is a primary principle that the accused must\n      be and not merely may be guilty before a court can convict\n      and the mental distance between ‘may be’ and ‘must be’ is\n      long and divides vague conjectures from sure\n      conclusions.”\n(2) the facts so established should be consistent only with the\nhypothesis of the guilt of the accused, that is to say, they should\nnot be explainable on any other hypothesis except that the\naccused is guilty,\n(3) the circumstances should be of a conclusive nature and\ntendency,\n(4) they should exclude every possible hypothesis except the one\nto be proved, and\n(5) there must be a chain of evidence so complete as not to leave\nany reasonable ground for the conclusion consistent with the\ninnocence of the accused and must show that in all human\nprobability the act must have been done by the accused.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_140\">154. These five golden principles, if we may say so, constitute the\npanchsheel of the proof of a case based on circumstantial\nevidence.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_141\">155. It may be interesting to note that as regards the mode of\nproof in a criminal case depending on circumstantial evidence, in\nthe absence of a corpus delicti, the statement of law as to proof of\nthe same was <a href=\"/doc/1035123/\" id=\"a_91\">laid down by</a> Gresson, J. (and concurred by 3 more\nJudges) in King v. Horry [1952 NZLR 111] thus:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_56\">      “Before he can be convicted, the fact of death should be\n      proved by such circumstances as render the commission\n      of the crime morally certain and leave no ground for\n      reasonable doubt: the circumstantial evidence should be\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_92\">                               69</span>\n\f              so cogent and compelling as to convince a jury that upon\n              no rational hypothesis other than murder can the facts be\n              accounted for.”\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_142\">        156. Lord Goddard slightly modified the expression “morally\n        certain” by “such circumstances as render the commission of the\n        crime certain”.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_143\">        157. This indicates the cardinal principle of criminal jurisprudence\n        that a case can be said to be proved only when there is certain\n        and explicit evidence and no person can be convicted on pure\n        moral conviction...”\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_144\">37.     Keeping the aforesaid principles in view, when we examine the\n\ncontentions of the learned counsel for the appellant, we find nothing of\n\nsubstance therein.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_145\">37.1.   It has been contended on behalf of the appellant that his name\n\nwas not mentioned in the first missing person report lodged in this matter,\n\nas admitted by PW-1 Kamla and PW-3 Madan Lal; and that the said first\n\nreport has not been placed on record. This contention has its roots in the\n\nlast line occurring in the statement made by PW-1 Kamla in her cross-\n\nexamination that she had lodged a missing person report in which the\n\nname of appellant was not stated. It may also have its basis in the\n\nstatement made by PW-3 Madan Lal in his cross-examination that after\n\nthe accused Manoj Pratap Singh took away the child, they went to Police\n\nPost Bandiyabada, where missing report was lodged.\n\n37.1.1. The contention is, however, totally detached from reality as also\n\nfrom the factual matrix. It has been consistently maintained that the\n\nappellant kidnapped the victim girl at about 6:30 p.m. from the vending\n\ncart of PW-1 Kamla. It has been proved by all the relevant witnesses that\n\nthe attempts were made to chase the appellant but he could not be\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_93\">                                       70</span>\n\fstopped. Though no such report made in writing at Police Post\n\nBandiyabada is on record but, even if it be assumed that they first went to\n\nthe said police post (as stated by PW-3), so far giving the name of the\n\nappellant as the person kidnapping the child is concerned, PW-3 had\n\nbeen specific that his name was known to them and was given to the\n\npolice post too. Reference to some report at the said police post carries\n\nhardly any adverse impact on the prosecution case because the\n\ninformation stated in the form of complaint by PW-1 Kamla accompanied\n\nby PW-3 Madan Lal was indeed recorded in writing by PW-19 Nand Lal at\n\n8:15 p.m. at the police station. It has been established that the police\n\nstation was at a distance of about 7 km from the place of kidnapping. It\n\nhas also been pointed out by PW-1 that it took about 30 to 45 minutes to\n\nreach the police station in an auto and the oral report was made at 8:15\n\np.m. In view of the specific facts stated in unison by the relevant\n\nprosecution witnesses that the name and identity of the kidnapper was\n\nknown to them, coupled with the time that elapsed from the moment of\n\nkidnapping (around 6:30 p.m.) and until lodging of the report at the police\n\nstation (around 8:15 p.m.) while providing for commuting time, there was\n\nneither any occasion nor any reason for the prosecution witnesses to omit\n\nthe name of the appellant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_146\">37.1.2. The report (Ex. P-1) and the FIR registered on its basis (Ex. P-2)\n\nhad been specific, not only giving the name of the appellant (though in the\n\nreport, the name given was Manoj Singh and not Manoj Pratap Singh) but\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_94\">                                    71</span>\n\ffurther to that, the informant also stated her knowledge that the person\n\nconcerned was the one who was earlier living in the Housing Board\n\nColony. In the face of the contents of the report Ex. P-1 and the FIR Ex.\n\nP- 2 as also the consistent testimony of PW-1 Kamla, PW-2 Dharam Das,\n\nPW-3 Madan Lal, PW-5 Maniraj Singh and PW-17 Dinesh Bhatia, who\n\nstated in no uncertain terms that it was the appellant who kidnapped the\n\nvictim girl, the contention urged on behalf of the appellant could only be\n\nrejected. Moreover, PW-12 Ranjit Singh has established a crucial fact that\n\naround the very same time as that of kidnapping of the victim girl, the\n\nappellant reached the liquor shop and purchased beer while a girl child\n\nwas sitting on his motorcycle. The testimony of this witness has also\n\nremained unshaken in the cross-examination. The appellant has not been\n\nable to show as to why this independent witness would at all be deposing\n\nagainst him. The appellant has further failed to explain if the girl child\n\nsitting on his motorcycle at the time of purchasing beer from the shop of\n\nPW-12 Ranjit Singh was not the victim girl but anyone else.\n\n37.1.3. Thus, the evidence on record is categorical and clear that the\n\nvictim girl was last seen alive only with the appellant.\n\n37.2.   The other part of contention with reference to the medical and\n\nother scientific evidence also carry no substance whatsoever. It has been\n\nargued, by relying on one sentence in the deposition of one of the doctors\n\nof Medical Board during cross-examination that the death might have\n\nbeen caused as a result of rape, that the appellant had not intended to\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_95\">                                      72</span>\n\fcause death. The post-mortem report (Ex. P-35), as reproduced\n\nhereinbefore leaves nothing to doubt that the hapless victim sustained\n\nextensive injuries all over her body and the injuries particularly on her\n\nhead as also on the private parts had been rather horrific. Her death\n\nultimately had been due to head injuries, as opined by the doctors of the\n\nMedical Board. We have reproduced hereinbefore the relevant part of the\n\nstatement of PW-14 Dr. Manju Purohit, a member of the Medical Board\n\nconducting       post-mortem     examination13.   The   expressions   “brutal”,\n\n“inhuman”, “cruel” etc. came in her statement with reference to the Court\n\nquestion, where she was asked her expert medical opinion after\n\nconducting external and internal examination of injuries and after\n\nanalysing the circumstances and condition of body; and she opined with\n\nreference to the injuries that ‘the eight year old innocent girl had been\n\nbrutally and inhumanly raped and on objecting, the person who raped her\n\nbehaved in an inhuman and cruel manner as a result of which, she\n\nsustained different simple and grievous injuries due to which she died’.\n\nShe further pointed out her opinion about brutality while stating that\n\n‘laceration of the vagina of the deceased shows that she was brutally\n\nraped in an inhuman manner’. However, in her further cross-examination,\n\nthis witness categorically affirmed the opinion stated by the Medical\n\nBoard in the post-mortem report about the cause of death and clearly\n\nstated that ‘the cause of death was injury caused on the head’. In the\n\n\n13 Vide paragraph 8.3 (supra).\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_96\">                                        73</span><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_147\">\n\fgiven set of circumstances and cogent expert medical evidence, the\n\nabsence of semen on the body of the victim or in the vaginal swab is\n\nhardly of any bearing on the substance of the matter. Hence, the\n\ncontentions urged on behalf of the appellant in relation to the medical\n\nevidence remain baseless and stand rejected. In continuity, we may also\n\nobserve that the submissions suggestive of the victim having received\n\nonly bruises and abrasions apart from injury on head are also incorrect. A\n\nbare reference to the extensive post-mortem report (Ex. P-35) and the\n\nstatements of the doctors of the Medical Board PW-14, PW-15 and PW-\n\n21 is sufficient to reject these suggestions.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_148\">37.2.1. Apart from the above, one line occurring in the deposition of PW-\n\n21 Dr. Chetna Vaishnav has been picked up to build an argument on\n\nbehalf of the appellant that the death of the victim girl might have been\n\ncaused as a result of rape; and it has been submitted that causing death\n\ncannot be taken to be the intention of the appellant. The argument is\n\npremised on a wrong and incomplete reading of the statement of PW-21\n\nDr. Chetna Vaishnav. She too had been categorical in her examination-\n\nin-chief about the post-mortem report and had deposed consistently with\n\nPW-14 Dr. Manju Purohit and PW-15 Dr. Kailash Chand that as per\n\nMedical Board, the head injury was the cause of death. She reasserted\n\nthis fact in her cross-examination too, while stating that ‘in the opinion of\n\nmedical board, multiple injuries were found on the head of the deceased\n\nwhich collectively resulted in death of the deceased’. She had, of course,\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_97\">                                     74</span>\n\fstated in her examination-in-chief that ‘the deceased was subjected to\n\nbrutal rape and her death was caused’ but, reading her testimony as a\n\nwhole, it is but clear that in this sentence, what she intended to convey\n\nwas about two different acts, i.e., of committing rape and of causing\n\ndeath. She had not stated that death was caused by rape.\n\n37.2.2. Having examined the post-mortem report and the testimonies of\n\nthe doctors conducting post-mortem, we are clearly of the view that even\n\nby distortion of language occurring in their testimonies, it cannot be\n\ndeduced that there was any doubt or difference of opinion in the Medical\n\nBoard about the cause of death. In other words, the doctors had been\n\nclear, categorical and consistent that the victim girl died due to the injuries\n\ncaused on her head.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_149\">37.3.   As regards another contention about the doubts on collection of\n\nblood samples from the metal surface of the motorcycle in question\n\nbecause of the alleged rain or drizzling or storm, first of all it may be\n\nmentioned that there had not been any specific evidence about any\n\nexcessive rain in the nature of storm. It has, of course, been stated by the\n\nwitnesses that at the time of kidnapping of the victim girl, it was\n\nraining/drizzling. However, there is no such evidence that at the time of\n\narrest of the appellant, or at the time of his disclosure statement at about\n\n2:00 a.m. on 18.01.2013, or at the time of recovery of dead body at about\n\n3:15 a.m. on 18.01.2013, or at the time of recovery of motorcycle at about\n\n4:45 p.m. on 19.01.2013, or at the time of collection of blood sample from\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_98\">                                      75</span>\n\fthe motorcycle at about 5:00 p.m. on 19.01.2013, there had been any\n\nsuch rain or drizzle for which, the requisite samples could not have been\n\ncollected. This is apart from the fact that FSL had clearly and undoubtedly\n\nperformed DNA test on the blood sample collected from motorcycle\n\n(packet marked D-Exhibit No. 6 in the FSL report Ex. P-51). Thus, the\n\nsubmission doubting the collection of blood sample from the motorcycle is\n\nalso totally baseless and stands rejected.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_150\">37.4.   The other submission seeking to question the factum of mental\n\nand physical disabilities of the victim girl does not carry any substance at\n\nall. Apart from the fact that mental and physical disabilities of the child\n\nhave been consistently stated by her parents and grandfather, the fact of\n\nthe matter remains that way back on 04.03.2010, the Medical Board\n\nfound her suffering from spastic palsy (vide Ex. P-11); and PW-18 Dr.\n\nNarendra Paliwal indeed proved the said certificate. In fact, the\n\nInvestigating Officer PW-25 Umesh Ojha took care to seek medical\n\nopinion/comments regarding the nature of disablement of the victim girl\n\nwith reference to the said certificate Ex. P-11 by way of a communication\n\ndated 22.01.2013 (Ex.- 52) and thereupon, the Medical Officer made his\n\nendorsement to the effect that ‘her cordination movements of limbs which\n\nare controlled by brain were disturbed and as such she was physically\n\nand mentally challenged child’. The submissions as regards evidentiary\n\nvalue of school certificates carry no meaning when the matter is\n\nexamined with reference to the overall evidence on record, which leaves\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_99\">                                    76</span>\n\fnothing to doubt that the victim girl was a mentally and physically\n\nchallenged child. Percentage of disablement is not the matter in issue\n\nhere. The relevant facts are that she was suffering from mental and\n\nphysical disabilities and was below 8 years of age. These facts are duly\n\nproved on record.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_151\">38.    Hence, the contentions urged on behalf of the appellant seeking to\n\nquestion the concurrent findings by reference to certain non-existent or\n\nirrelevant factors need to be rejected altogether.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_152\">39.    We may usefully summarise the facts and factors established\n\nbeyond doubt on record forming the complete chain of circumstances\n\nthat: a) the deceased was seven-and-a-half-years old mentally and\n\nphysically challenged girl; b) the deceased was last seen with the\n\nappellant when he kidnapped her from the lawful guardianship of her\n\nparents; c) the appellant was arrested within about 7½ hours of kidnap; d)\n\nthe clothes worn by the appellant were bloodstained, which were seized\n\nand sealed; e) after about 1½ hours of his arrest, the dead body of the\n\nvictim girl was recovered at     a faraway place on the disclosure and\n\ninformation of the appellant; f) the motorcycle used by the appellant and\n\nthe frock worn by the victim girl were also recovered at a faraway place at\n\nthe disclosure and information of the appellant; g) the appellant failed to\n\naccount for his own whereabouts as also the whereabouts of the victim\n\ngirl since after the time of kidnap; h) the appellant also failed to show the\n\nreason of his knowledge about the place/places where the dead body, the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_100\">                                     77</span>\n\fmotorcycle and the frock were recovered; i) as per the evidence on\n\nrecord, it had been a case of brutal rape (with gruesome injuries on and\n\naround private parts) and merciless killing (with horrific injuries on head)\n\nof the victim girl; j) the victim died due to the injuries on her head; k) the\n\nDNA profile of blood collected from the person and clothing of the victim\n\ngirl matched with the DNA profile of blood found on the coat, pant and\n\nshirt of the appellant and on the motorcycle 14. This chain is so complete in\n\nitself that no stretch of imagination could take us to any other hypothesis\n\nexcept the guilt of the appellant in relation to the offences charged.\n\nHence, the concurrent findings of the Trial Court and the High Court\n\nholding the appellant guilty are imminently just and proper; and call for no\n\ninterference whatsoever.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_153\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"151550237\" id=\"span_101\">39.1.    We may also indicate at least two other facts established on\n\nrecord which not only strengthen the complete chain of circumstances\n\nnoticed above but, have their own bearing in this matter. The first one of\n\nthese facts, which is duly attached to the chain of circumstances, is that\n\nthe motorcycle used in this crime bearing registration number RJ30 3M\n\n5944 was itself stolen on 14.01.2013 for which, a theft report had already\n14 The value and worth of DNA profile matching in criminal cases has been succinctly stated by\nthis Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/151550237/\" id=\"a_92\">Anil @ Anthony Arikswamy Joseph v. State of Maharashtra</a>: 2014\n(4) SCC 69 in the following terms: -</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_57\">              “18. Deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, is a molecule that encodes the genetic\n          information in all living organisms. DNA genotype can be obtained from any\n          biological material such as bone, blood, semen, saliva, hair, skin, etc. Now, for\n          several years, DNA profile has also shown a tremendous impact on forensic\n          investigation. Generally, when DNA profile of a sample found at the scene of\n          crime matches with the DNA profile of the suspect, it can generally be\n          concluded that both the samples have the same biological origin. DNA profile is\n          valid and reliable, but variance in a particular result depends on the quality\n          control and quality procedure in the laboratory.”\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_102\">                                             78</span>\n\fbeen lodged at Police Station Nathdwara, as distinctly proved by PW-23\n\nRamdev Regar, Sub-Inspector of Police. It has been duly established on\n\nrecord that the appellant indeed used that motorcycle in kidnapping the\n\nvictim girl and the motorcycle was recovered as per the information\n\nsupplied by the appellant. It has not been a case of the appellant that the\n\nmotorcycle belonged to him or was given to him by its owner. Thus,\n\nundoubtedly, the appellant used stolen motorcycle in committing this\n\ncrime. The second one of these facts, duly established by the testimony\n\nof PW-12 Ranjeet Singh, had been that after kidnapping the victim girl\n\nfrom the lawful guardianship of her parents, the appellant headed towards\n\nthe liquor shop with the victim girl sitting on the motorcycle; he purchased\n\na bottle of beer and he even quarrelled as regards the price; and he left\n\nthe liquor shop with a bottle of beer and with the victim girl sitting on the\n\nmotorcycle. These facts and factors only worsen the criminality of conduct\n\nduly found proved against the appellant.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_58\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"13149785\" id=\"span_103\">40.    For what has been discussed hereinabove, we have not an iota of\n\ndoubt that the present case of circumstantial evidence answers to the\n\npanchsheel principles of <a href=\"/doc/13149785/\" id=\"a_93\">Sharad Birdhichand Sarda</a> (supra). The\n\nappellant was rightly convicted by the Trial Court and his conviction has\n\nrightly been maintained by the High Court. To put it in other words, having\n\nexamined the matter in its totality, we are satisfied that the prosecution\n\nhas been able to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, rather beyond\n\nany doubt whatsoever. The chain of circumstances projected by the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_104\">                                     79</span>\n\fprosecution is complete in its entirety and leads only to the result that the\n\nappellant had been the person who kidnapped, raped and murdered the\n\nvictim, seven-and-a-half-years old mentally and physically challenged girl.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_154\">Hence, the concurrent findings leading to conviction of the appellant of\n\nthe offences aforementioned call for no interference; and deserve to be\n\nconfirmed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_155\">41.    Even when we uphold the concurrent findings leading to\n\nconviction of the appellant, the question remains about the death\n\nsentence awarded to him for the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_94\">Section 302</a> IPC, which\n\nhas been seriously challenged in these appeals. Before proceeding to\n\ndeal with this major question calling for determination in this case, we\n\nmay dispose of one of the unnecessary submissions made on behalf of\n\nthe appellant as regards his conviction both under POCSO and <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_95\">IPC</a>. This\n\nsubmission, made with reference to <a href=\"/doc/174867083/\" id=\"a_96\">Section 42</a> POCSO, is also baseless.\n\nThe mandate for awarding punishment which is greater in degree does\n\nnot correspondingly lead to the proposition that the appellant could not\n\nhave been convicted of the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_97\">Section 376</a> IPC as also under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/183539218/\" id=\"a_98\">Section 6</a> POCSO. This aspect need not detain us much longer because\n\nthe core question in this case after confirmation of conviction is as to\n\nwhether death sentence awarded for the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_99\">Section 302</a> IPC\n\nbe maintained or be substituted by any other sentence.\n\nWhether death sentence be maintained or substituted by any other\nsentence\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_105\">                                     80</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_156\">\f42.    As noticed, two-fold submissions have been put at the forefront by\n\nlearned senior counsel for the appellant in challenge to the death\n\nsentence awarded in this case. First, that the present case is based on\n\ncircumstantial evidence rather than absolute proof and therefore, benefit\n\nof ‘residual doubt’ ought to be given to the appellant and capital sentence\n\nshould not be awarded because, the present case may be a rare one but\n\nis not the rarest of rare. Secondly, learned senior counsel has referred to\n\nthe mitigating factors wherefor the appellant deserves to be spared from\n\ncapital sentence, being those of his young age at the time of commission\n\nof the crime in question; his poor economic background; his having family\n\nwith wife, minor daughter and aged father; and strong probability of his\n\nreformation. Per contra, learned senior counsel for the respondent-State\n\nhas highlighted the aggravating circumstances that the appellant had\n\nkidnapped, raped and murdered a mentally and physically challenged girl\n\nchild; that his acts and actions disclose his planning and pre-meditated\n\nactions; and that the ghastly crime was committed in a diabolical and\n\nbarbaric manner. Apart from other factors, learned senior counsel for the\n\nrespondent-State has highlighted the facts about post-conviction\n\nfelonious conduct of the appellant where once he was awarded 7 days’\n\npunishment for quarrelling with another detainee and then, he was\n\nconvicted of the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_100\">Section 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_101\">34</a> IPC for killing of another\n\njail inmate. Learned counsel for the respondent would submit that the\n\nappellant has proven himself to be a recidivist, the person who is prone to\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_106\">                                    81</span>\n\fkilling people, has committed crimes in the past and has shown the\n\ntendency to relapse into crime repeatedly, and is dangerous to society.\n\n42.1.   Apropos the rival submissions and the fact that the sentence\n\nunder consideration is that of termination of a natural life, it is obvious that\n\nthe matter calls for a serious and heightened scrutiny of all the relevant\n\naspects, with reference to the statutory requirements as also the legal\n\nprinciples enunciated by this Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_157\">Death sentence: Evolution of principles and norms\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_158\">43.     As regards the statutory requirements, as per sub-section (2) of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1604716/\" id=\"a_102\">Section 235</a> CrPC, on being convicted and not being released on\n\nprobation or after admonition in terms of <a href=\"/doc/755395/\" id=\"a_103\">Section 360</a> CrPC, the accused\n\nhas to be heard by the Judge concerned on the question of sentence and\n\nthen, sentence has to be passed according to law. Moreover, as per sub-\n\nsection (3) of <a href=\"/doc/1266667/\" id=\"a_104\">Section 354</a> CrPC, if the conviction is for an offence\n\npunishable with death or in the alternative, with imprisonment for life or\n\nimprisonment for a particular term of years, the judgment has to state the\n\nreasons for the sentence awarded; and in case of death sentence, the\n\njudgment has to state ‘special reasons’ therefor.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_159\">43.1.   Sub-section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1604716/\" id=\"a_105\">Section 235</a> CrPC, providing for mandatory\n\nhearing of the accused before passing sentence, reads as under: -\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_59\">        “(2) If the accused is convicted, the Judge shall, unless he\n        proceeds in accordance with the provisions of section 360, hear\n        the accused on the question of sentence, and then pass sentence\n        on him according to law.”\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_107\">                                       82</span>\n\f43.2.

We may now usefully summarise the salient features of evolution\n\nof legal principles and norms for dealing with the question of sentencing\n\nin such matters where the sentence of death could also be awarded,\n\nparticularly with reference to the leading cases and expositions therein.\n\n44.1.     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1837051\" id=\"span_108\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/1837051/\" id=\"a_107\">Jagmohan Singh v. The State of U.P.</a>: (1973) 1\n\nSCC 20, the questions in their broader spectrum were raised about the\n\nconstitutional impermissibility of death sentence with the submissions: (i)\n\nthat the death sentence was unreasonable for it would put an end to all\n\nthe rights guaranteed under clauses (a) to (g) of <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_108\">Article 19(1)</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India; (ii) that the discretion vested in the Judges to\n\nimpose capital punishment was not based on any standards or policy and\n\nhence, the provision suffered from the vice of excessive delegation of\n\nlegislative function; (iii) that the uncontrolled and unguided discretion in\n\nthe Judges to impose capital punishment or imprisonment for life was hit\n\nby <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_109\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India; and (iv) that under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_110\">Article 21</a> of\n\nthe Constitution, no person shall be deprived of his life except according\n\nto the procedure established by law but, the provisions of law did not\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_109\">                                         83</span>\n\fprovide a procedure for trial of factors and circumstances crucial for\n\nmaking the choice between the capital punishment and imprisonment for\n\nlife.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_161\">44.1.1. The Constitution Bench rejected the aforesaid and corollary\n\narguments while pointing out, inter alia, that the provisions in the\n\nConstitution of India, like those of <a href=\"/doc/26959/\" id=\"a_111\">Articles 72(1)(c)</a><a href=\"/doc/81987034/\" id=\"a_112\">, 72(3)</a><a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_113\">, 21</a><a href=\"/doc/1446285/\" id=\"a_114\">, 134</a> as also\n\nthe then applicable provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1571667/\" id=\"a_115\">Sections 401</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1794580/\" id=\"a_116\">402</a> of the Code of\n\nCriminal Procedure, 1898 were indicative that capital sentence had not\n\nbeen regarded per se unreasonable or not in public interest; and that the\n\npolicy of law in giving a very wide discretion in the matter of punishment\n\nto the Judge has its origin in the impossibility of laying down standards,\n\nrather exercise of judicial discretion on well-recognised principles is the\n\nsafest possible safeguards for the accused.15 As regards the contentions\n\nurged on the anvil of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_117\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India, the Bench\n\nobserved that the Court in such matters would be principally concerned\n\nwith the facts and circumstances, whether aggravating or mitigating,\n\nwhich are connected with the particular crime under inquiry and which are\n\ncapable of being proved in accordance with the laws of procedure; and\n\n15 The Constitution Bench underscored the significance and worth of judicial discretion in the\nfollowing words: -\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_61\">              “26…...The impossibility of laying down standards is at the very core of the\n          criminal law as administered in India which invests the judges with a very wide\n          discretion in the matter of fixing the degree of punishment. The discretion in the\n          matter of sentence is, as already pointed out, liable to be corrected by superior\n          courts. Laying down of standards to the limited extent possible as was done in\n          the Model Judicial Code would not serve the purpose. The exercise of judicial\n          discretion on well-recognised principles is, in the final analysis, the safest\n          possible safeguards for the accused.”\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_110\">                                             84</span>\n\ffinally the parties on both sides were having opportunity to address the\n\nCourt whereafter the Judge would decide on the guilt and punishment.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_62\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1837051\" id=\"span_111\">The Constitution Bench observed that the relevant provisions were part of\n\nthe procedure established by law and those provisions were not shown to\n\nbe constitutionally invalid.

To sum up, the question whether or not death penalty serves\n        any penological purpose is a difficult, complex and intractable\n        issue. It has evoked strong, divergent views. For the purpose of\n        testing the constitutionality of the impugned provision as to death\n        penalty in Section 302 of the Penal Code on the ground of\n        reasonableness in the light of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_131\">Articles 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_132\">21</a> of the\n        Constitution, it is not necessary for us to express any categorical\n        opinion, one way or the other, as to which of these two antithetical\n        views, held by the Abolitionists and Retentionists, is correct. It is\n        sufficient to say that the very fact that persons of reason, learning\n        and light are rationally and deeply divided in their opinion on this\n        issue, is a ground among others, for rejecting the petitioners\n        argument that retention of death penalty in the impugned\n        provision, is totally devoid of reason and purpose. If,\n        notwithstanding the view of the Abolitionists to the contrary, a very\n        large segment of people, the world over, including sociologists,\n        legislators, jurists, judges and administrators still firmly believe in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_117\">                                        86</span>\n\fthe worth and necessity of capital punishment for the protection of\nsociety, if in the perspective of prevailing crime conditions in India,\ncontemporary public opinion channelized through the people&#x27;s\nrepresentatives in Parliament, has repeatedly in the last three\ndecades, rejected all attempts, including the one made recently, to\nabolish or specifically restrict the area of death penalty, if death\npenalty is still a recognised legal sanction for murder or some\ntypes of murder in most of the civilised countries in the world, if the\nframers of the Indian Constitution were fully aware — as we shall\npresently show they were — of the existence of death penalty as\npunishment for murder, under the Penal Code, 1860, if the 35th\nReport and subsequent reports of the Law Commission\nsuggesting retention of death penalty, and recommending revision\nof the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_133\">Criminal Procedure Code</a> and the insertion of the new\nSections 235(2) and 354(3) in that Code providing for pre-\nsentence hearing and sentencing procedure on conviction for\nmurder and other capital offences were before the Parliament and\npresumably considered by it when in 1972-1973 it took up revision\nof the Code of 1898 and replaced it by the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_134\">Code of Criminal\nProcedure</a>, 1973, it is not possible to hold that the provision of\ndeath penalty as an alternative punishment for murder, in Section\n302 of the Penal Code is unreasonable and not in the public\ninterest. We would, therefore, conclude that the impugned\nprovision in Section 302, violates neither the letter nor the ethos of\n<a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_135\">Article 19.</a>\n</blockquote><pre id=\"pre_3\">   ***                         ***                          ***\n136. <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_136\">Article 21</a> reads as under:\n</pre><blockquote id=\"blockquote_64\">      “No person shall be deprived of his life or personal\n      liberty except according to procedure established by\n      law.”\nIf this Article is expanded in accordance with the interpretative\nprinciple indicated in Maneka Gandhi [(1978) 1 SCC 248], it will\nread as follows:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_65\">      “No person shall be deprived of his life or personal\n      liberty except according to fair, just and reasonable\n      procedure established by valid law.”\nIn the converse positive form, the expanded Article will read as\nbelow:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_66\">      “A person may be deprived of his life or personal liberty\n      in accordance with fair, just and reasonable procedure\n      established by valid law.”\nThus expanded and read for interpretative purposes, <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_137\">Article 21</a>\nclearly brings out the implication, that the founding fathers\nrecognised the right of the State to deprive a person of his life or\npersonal liberty in accordance with fair, just and reasonable\nprocedure established by valid law. There are several other\nindications, also, in the Constitution which show that the\nConstitution-makers were fully cognizant of the existence of death\npenalty for murder and certain other offences in the Penal Code,\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_118\">                                87</span>\n\f       1860. Entries 1 and 2 in List III — Concurrent List — of the\n       Seventh Schedule, specifically refer to the Penal Code, 1860 and\n       the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_138\">Code of Criminal Procedure</a> as in force at the commencement\n       of the Constitution. <a href=\"/doc/26959/\" id=\"a_139\">Article 72(1)(c)</a> specifically invests the\n       President with power to suspend, remit or commute the sentence\n       of any person convicted of any offence, and also “in all cases\n       where the sentence is a sentence of death”. Likewise, under\n       <a href=\"/doc/873751/\" id=\"a_140\">Article 161</a>, the Governor of a State has been given power to\n       suspend, remit or commute, inter alia, the sentence of death of\n       any person convicted of murder or other capital offence relating to\n       a matter to which the executive power of the State extends. <a href=\"/doc/1446285/\" id=\"a_141\">Article\n       134</a>, in terms, gives a right of appeal to the Supreme Court to a\n       person who, on appeal, is sentenced to death by the High Court,\n       after reversal of his acquittal by the trial court. Under the\n       successive <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_142\">Criminal Procedure Code</a>s which have been in force\n       for about 100 years, a sentence of death is to be carried out by\n       hanging. In view of the aforesaid constitutional postulates, by no\n       stretch of imagination can it be said that death penalty under\n       Section 302 of the Penal Code, either per se or because of its\n       execution by hanging, constitutes an unreasonable, cruel or\n       unusual punishment. By reason of the same constitutional\n       postulates, it cannot be said that the framers of the Constitution\n       considered death sentence for murder or the prescribed traditional\n       mode of its execution as a degrading punishment which would\n       defile “the dignity of the individual” within the contemplation of the\n       preamble to the Constitution. On parity of reasoning, it cannot be\n       said that death penalty for the offence of murder violates the basic\n       structure of the Constitution.”\n\n44.3.2. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1837051\" id=\"span_119\">In relation to the second question, the Court examined the\n\ndevelopment of law, particularly the change of legislative policy with\n\nintroduction of <a href=\"/doc/324405/\" id=\"a_143\">Section 354(3)</a> CrPC as also the Law Commission’s\n\nreports and various past decisions; and summarised the propositions <a href=\"/doc/307021/\" id=\"a_144\">laid\n\ndown in</a> <a href=\"/doc/1837051/\" id=\"a_145\">Jagmohan</a> (supra) in the following terms: -</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_67\">       “160. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1837051\" id=\"span_120\">In the light of the above conspectus, we will now consider\n       the effect of the aforesaid legislative changes on the authority and\n       efficacy of the propositions <a href=\"/doc/1837051/\" id=\"a_146\">laid down by</a> this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1837051/\" id=\"a_147\">Jagmohan</a>\n       case. These propositions may be summed up as under:</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_68\">           (i) The general legislative policy that underlines the structure of\n       our criminal law, principally contained in the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_148\">Indian Penal Code</a>\n       and the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_149\">Criminal Procedure Code</a>, is to define an offence with\n       sufficient clarity and to prescribe only the maximum punishment\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_121\">                                       88</span>\n\ftherefor, and to allow a very wide discretion to the Judge in the\nmatter of fixing the degree of punishment.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_164\">   With the solitary exception of Section 303, the same policy\npermeates Section 302 and some other sections of the Penal\nCode, where the maximum punishment is the death penalty.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_165\">   (ii) (a) No exhaustive enumeration of aggravating or mitigating\ncircumstances which should be considered when sentencing an\noffender, is possible. “The infinite variety of cases and facets to\neach case would make general standards either meaningless\n‘boiler plate’ or a statement of the obvious that no Jury (Judge)\nwould need.” (referred to McGoutha v. California: (1971) 402 US\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_166\">183)\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_167\">         (b) The impossibility of laying down standards is at the very\ncore of the criminal law as administered in India which invests the\nJudges with a very wide discretion in the matter of fixing the\ndegree of punishment.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_168\">   (iii) The view taken by the plurality in Furman v. Georgia: (1976)\n1 SCC 425, decided by the Supreme Court of the United States, to\nthe effect, that a law which gives uncontrolled and unguided\ndiscretion to the Jury (or the Judge) to choose arbitrarily between\na sentence of death and imprisonment for a capital offence,\nviolates the Eighth Amendment, is not applicable in India. We do\nnot have in our Constitution any provision like the Eighth\nAmendment, nor are we at liberty to apply the test of\nreasonableness with the freedom with which the Judges of the\nSupreme Court of America are accustomed to apply “the due\nprocess” clause. There are grave doubts about the expediency of\ntransplanting western experience in our country. Social conditions\nare different and so also the general intellectual level. Arguments\nwhich would be valid in respect of one area of the world may not\nhold good in respect of another area.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_169\">   (iv) (a) This discretion in the matter of sentence is to be\nexercised by the Judge judicially, after balancing all the\naggravating and mitigating circumstances of the crime.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_170\">            (b) The discretion is liable to be corrected by superior\ncourts. The exercise of judicial discretion on well recognised\nprinciples is, in the final analysis, the safest possible safeguard for\nthe accused.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_171\">   In view of the above, it will be impossible to say that there\nwould be at all any discrimination, since crime as crime may\nappear to be superficially the same but the facts and\ncircumstances of a crime are widely different. Thus considered,\nthe provision in Section 302, Penal Code is not violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_150\">Article\n14</a> of the Constitution on the ground that it confers on the Judges\nan unguided and uncontrolled discretion in the matter of awarding\ncapital punishment or imprisonment for life.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_172\">   (v) (a) Relevant facts and circumstances impinging on the\nnature and circumstances of the crime can be brought before the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_122\">                                89</span>\n\f          court at the pre-conviction stage, notwithstanding the fact that no\n          formal procedure for producing evidence regarding such facts and\n          circumstances had been specifically provided. Where counsel\n          addresses the court with regard to the character and standing of\n          the accused, they are duly considered by the court unless there is\n          something in the evidence itself which belies him or the Public\n          Prosecutor challenges the facts.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_173\">                  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1837051\" id=\"span_123\">(b) It is to be emphasised that in exercising its discretion to\n          choose either of the two alternative sentences provided in Section\n          302 Penal Code, “the court is principally concerned with the facts\n          and circumstances whether aggravating or mitigating, which are\n          connected with the particular crime under inquiry. All such facts\n          and circumstances are capable of being proved in accordance\n          with the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_151\">Indian Evidence Act</a> in a trial regulated\n          by the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_152\">CrPC</a>. The trial does not come to an end until all the\n          relevant facts are proved and the counsel on both sides have an\n          opportunity to address the court. The only thing that remains is for\n          the Judge to decide on the guilt and punishment and that is what\n          <a href=\"/doc/1918898/\" id=\"a_153\">Sections 306 (2)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/152094/\" id=\"a_154\">309 (2)</a>, CrPC purport to provide for. These\n          provisions are part of the procedure established by law and unless\n          it is shown that they are invalid for any other reasons they must be\n          regarded as valid. No reasons are offered to show that they are\n          constitutionally invalid and hence the death sentence imposed\n          after trial in accordance with the procedure established by law is\n          not unconstitutional under Article 21”. (SCC p. 36), (emphasis\n          added)”\n\n44.3.3.     The Court, thereafter, observed that the authority of the\n\npropositions aforesaid had not been affected by the legislative changes\n\nbut two of the propositions, at No. (iv)(a) and (v)(b), would require\n\nmodulation in terms of the changed legislative policy delineated in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/324405/\" id=\"a_155\">Sections 354(3)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/729076/\" id=\"a_156\">235(2)</a> CrPC. Thus, while otherwise reaffirming the\n\nview taken in <a href=\"/doc/1837051/\" id=\"a_157\">Jagmohan</a> (supra) the Court held and laid down as under: -</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_69\">          “164. Attuned to the legislative policy delineated in Sections 354(3)\n          and 235(2), propositions (iv)(a) and (v)(b) in Jagmohan shall have\n          to be recast and may be stated as below:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_70\">                (a) The normal rule is that the offence of murder shall\n                be punished with the sentence of life imprisonment. The\n                court can depart from that rule and impose the\n                sentence of death only if there are special reasons for\n                doing so. Such reasons must be recorded in writing\n                before imposing the death sentence.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_124\">                                          90</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_71\">\f      (b) While considering the question of sentence to be\n      imposed for the offence of murder under Section 302 of\n      the Penal Code, the court must have regard to every\n      relevant circumstance relating to the crime as well as\n      the criminal. If the court finds, but not otherwise, that\n      the offence is of an exceptionally depraved and heinous\n      character and constitutes, on account of its design and\n      the manner of its execution, a source of grave danger to\n      the society at large, the court may impose the death\n      sentence.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_174\">165. The soundness or application of the other propositions\nin Jagmohan, and the premises on which they rest, are not\naffected in any way by the legislative changes since effected. On\nthe contrary, these changes reinforce the reasons given\nin Jagmohan, for holding that the impugned provisions of the\nPenal Code and the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_158\">Criminal Procedure Code</a> do not offend\n<a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_159\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_160\">21</a> of the Constitution. Now, Parliament has in\nSection 354 (3) given a broad and clear guide-line which is to\nserve the purpose of lodestar to the court in the exercise of its\nsentencing discretion. Parliament has advisedly not restricted this\nsentencing discretion further, as, in its legislative judgment, it is\nneither possible nor desirable to do so. Parliament could not but\nbe aware that since the <a href=\"/doc/1596533/\" id=\"a_161\">Amending Act</a> 26 of 1955, death penalty\nhas been imposed by courts on an extremely small percentage of\npersons convicted of murder — a fact which demonstrates that\ncourts have generally exercised their discretion in inflicting this\nextreme penalty with great circumspection, caution and restraint.\nCognizant of the past experience of the administration of death\npenalty in India, Parliament, in its wisdom, thought it best and safe\nto leave the imposition of this gravest punishment in gravest cases\nof murder, to the judicial discretion of the courts which are manned\nby persons of reason, experience and standing in the profession.\nThe exercise of this sentencing discretion cannot be said to be\nuntrammelled and unguided. It is exercised judicially in\naccordance with well recognised principles crystallised by judicial\ndecisions, directed along the broad contours of legislative policy\ntowards the signposts enacted in Section 354(3).\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_175\">166. The new Section 235(2) adds to the number of several other\nsafeguards which were embodied in the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_162\">Criminal Procedure Code</a>\nof 1898 and have been re-enacted in the Code of 1973. Then, the\nerrors in the exercise of this guided judicial discretion are liable to\nbe corrected by the superior courts. The procedure provided in\n<a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_163\">Criminal Procedure Code</a> for imposing capital punishment for\nmurder and some other capital crimes under the Penal Code\ncannot, by any reckoning, be said to be unfair, unreasonable and\nunjust. Nor can it be said that this sentencing discretion, with\nwhich the courts are invested, amounts to delegation of its power\nof legislation by Parliament. The argument to that effect is entirely\nmisconceived. We would, therefore, reaffirm the view taken by this\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_125\">                                91</span>\n\f       Court in Jagmohan, and hold that the impugned provisions do not\n       violate <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_164\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_165\">, 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_166\">21</a> of the Constitution.”\n                                                            (emphasis supplied)\n\n44.3.4. The Court also stated that ‘special reasons&#x27; in the context of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/324405/\" id=\"a_167\">Section 354(3)</a> CrPC would obviously mean ‘exceptional reasons’,\n\nmeaning thereby, that the extreme penalty should be imposed only in\n\nextreme cases in the following terms: -\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_72\">       “161. .…The expression “special reasons” in the context of this\n       provision, obviously means “exceptional reasons” founded on the\n       exceptionally grave circumstances of the particular case relating to\n       the crime as well as the criminal. Thus, the legislative policy now\n       writ large and clear on the face of Section 354(3) is that on\n       conviction for murder and other capital offences punishable in the\n       alternative with death under the Penal Code, the extreme penalty\n       should be imposed only in extreme cases.”\n                                                            (emphasis supplied)\n\n44.3.5. After taking note of various circumstances projected before it,\n\nwhich could be of mitigating factors, and while observing that the scope\n\nand concept of mitigating factors in the area of death penalty must\n\nreceive a liberal and expansive construction, the Court proceeded to\n\nuphold the constitutional validity of <a href=\"/doc/324405/\" id=\"a_168\">Section 354(3)</a> CrPC, with the\n\nobservations that the legislature had explicitly prioritised life imprisonment\n\nas the normal punishment and death penalty as being of exception, and\n\nwith enunciation of rarest of rare doctrine in the following words: -\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_73\">       “209.....It is, therefore, imperative to voice the concern that courts,\n       aided by the broad illustrative guide-lines indicated by us, will\n       discharge the onerous function with evermore scrupulous care and\n       humane concern, directed along the highroad of legislative policy\n       outlined in Section 354(3), viz., that for persons convicted of\n       murder, life imprisonment is the rule and death sentence an\n       exception.

While pointing out the fallacy of this argument, the\n\nConstitution Bench explained as to what exactly had been the ratio of\n\nBachan Singh in the following words: -</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_74\">        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"307021\" id=\"span_130\">“7.….The majority did not lay down any abstract proposition in\n        Bachan Singh that &quot;death sentence is Constitutional&quot;, that is to\n        say, that &quot;It is permissible under the Constitution to provide for the\n        sentence of death&quot;. To be exact, the question which arose for the\n        consideration of the Court was not whether, under the\n        Constitution, it is permissible to provide for the sentence of death.\n        The precise question which arose <a href=\"/doc/307021/\" id=\"a_174\">in that case</a> was whether\n        Section 302 of the Penal Code which provides for the sentence of\n        death as one of the two alternative sentences is valid. It may be\n        recalled that Section 302 provides for the sentence of death as an\n        alternative sentence which may be imposed. The normal sentence\n        for murder is life imprisonment; and if the death sentence has to\n        be imposed, the Court is under a legal obligation under <a href=\"/doc/324405/\" id=\"a_175\">Section\n        354(3)</a> of the Criminal Procedure Code to state the special\n        reasons for imposing that sentence. That explains why, in Bachan\n        Singh, Sarkaria J., who spoke for the majority, underscored the\n        words &quot;alternative&quot; and &quot;may&quot; in paragraph 19 of the judgment,\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_131\">                                        93</span>\n\f        whilst observing that prescribes death as an alternative\n        punishment to which the offender may be sentenced in cases\n        relating to seven kinds of offences. The majority concluded that of\n        the Penal Code is valid for three main reasons: Firstly, that the\n        death sentence provided for by Section 302 is an alternative to the\n        sentence of life imprisonment, secondly, that special reasons have\n        to be stated if the normal rule is departed from and the death\n        sentence has to be imposed; and, thirdly, because the accused is\n        entitled, under <a href=\"/doc/729076/\" id=\"a_176\">Section 235(2)</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure,\n        to be heard on the question of sentence. The last of these three\n        reasons becomes relevant, only because of the first of these\n        reasons. In other words, it is because the Court has an option to\n        impose either of the two alternative sentences, subject to the rule\n        that the normal punishment for murder is life imprisonment, that it\n        is important to hear the accused on the question of\n        sentence….The ratio of Bachan Singh, therefore, is that, death\n        sentence is Constitutional if it is prescribed as an alternative\n        sentence for the offence of murder and if the normal sentence\n        prescribed by law for murder is imprisonment for life….”\n                                                           (emphasis supplied)\n\n44.5.</span>   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"545301\" id=\"span_132\">Thereafter, in <a href=\"/doc/545301/\" id=\"a_177\">Machhi Singh</a> (supra), a 3-Judge Bench of this\n\nCourt, while considering a case where the appellant was convicted of\n\norchestrating and executing a conspiracy, which resulted in the murder of\n\nas many as 17 people due to a family feud, explained the philosophy\n\npertaining to the death sentence in the following words: -</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_75\">        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"307021\" id=\"span_133\">“32. …Every member of the community owes a debt to the\n        community for this protection.

Another relevant decision to be noticed is that in the case of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/989335/\" id=\"a_181\">Swamy Shraddananda</a> (2) (supra). The said decision was rendered by a\n\n3-Judge Bench of this Court in the backdrop that though a 2-Judge Bench\n\nof this Court upheld the conviction of the appellant of offences under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_182\">Sections 302</a> and <a href=\"/doc/386021/\" id=\"a_183\">201</a> IPC but, one of the learned Judges felt that in the\n\nfacts and circumstances of the case, punishment of imprisonment till the\n\nend of the natural life of the convict would serve the ends of justice,\n\nwhereas the other learned Judge was of the view that the appellant was\n\nliable to the punishment of death. In keeping with the ever-progressing\n\ncanons of penology, the 3-Judge Bench carved out a different course,\n\nbeing of not awarding death penalty but, of conditioning the sentence of\n\nimprisonment for life with a rider that the convict shall not be released\n\nfrom the prison for the rest of his life. The Court explained the logic of\n\nsuch sentencing, which overrides the availability of remission, in the\n\nfollowing terms: -</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_83\">        “92. The matter may be looked at from a slightly different angle.\n        The issue of sentencing has two aspects. A sentence may be\n        excessive and unduly harsh or it may be highly disproportionately\n        inadequate. When an appellant comes to this Court carrying a\n        death sentence awarded by the trial court and confirmed by the\n        High Court, this Court may find, as in the present appeal, that the\n        case just falls short of the rarest of the rare category and may feel\n        somewhat reluctant in endorsing the death sentence. But at the\n        same time, having regard to the nature of the crime, the Court may\n        strongly feel that a sentence of life imprisonment subject to\n        remission normally works out to a term of 14 years would be\n        grossly disproportionate and inadequate. What then should the\n        Court do? If the Court&#x27;s option is limited only to two punishments,\n        one a sentence of imprisonment, for all intents and purposes, of\n        not more than 14 years and the other death, the Court may feel\n        tempted and find itself nudged into endorsing the death penalty.\n        Such a course would indeed be disastrous. A far more just,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_139\">                                       96</span>\n\f        reasonable and proper course would be to expand the options and\n        to take over what, as a matter of fact, lawfully belongs to the Court\n        i.e. the vast hiatus between 14 years&#x27; imprisonment and death. It\n        needs to be emphasised that the Court would take recourse to the\n        expanded option primarily because in the facts of the case, the\n        sentence of 14 years&#x27; imprisonment would amount to no\n        punishment at all.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_84\">        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"79577238\" id=\"span_140\">93. Further, the formalisation of a special category of sentence,\n        though for an extremely few number of cases, shall have the great\n        advantage of having the death penalty on the statute book but to\n        actually use it as little as possible, really in the rarest of rare\n        cases. This would only be a reassertion of the Constitution Bench\n        decision in Bachan Singh besides being in accord with the modern\n        trends in penology.”\n                                                          (emphasis supplied)\n\n44.7.   We need not elongate this discussion by assembling various other\n\ndecisions rendered in variegated circumstances and factual matrices but\n\ndeem it appropriate to refer to the decision in the case of <a href=\"/doc/79577238/\" id=\"a_184\">Shankar\n\nKisanrao Khade v.

To award death sentence, the “crime\n        test” has to be fully satisfied, that is, 100% and “criminal test” 0%,\n        that is, no mitigating circumstance favouring the accused. If there\n        is any circumstance favouring the accused, like lack of intention to\n        commit the crime, possibility of reformation, young age of the\n        accused, not a menace to the society, no previous track record,\n        etc. the “criminal test” may favour the accused to avoid the capital\n        punishment.

R-R test depends upon\n        the perception of the society that is “society-centric” and not\n        “Judge-centric”, that is, whether the society will approve the\n        awarding of death sentence to certain types of crimes or not.\n        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"50602236\" id=\"span_144\">While applying that test, the court has to look into variety of factors\n        like society&#x27;s abhorrence, extreme indignation and antipathy to\n        certain types of crimes like sexual assault and murder of\n        intellectually challenged minor girls, suffering from physical\n        disability, old and infirm women with those disabilities, etc.\n        Examples are only illustrative and not exhaustive.

Though his appeal to this Court was\n\ndismissed and review petition was also dismissed but, his review petition\n\nwas later on reopened and heard by a 3-Judge Bench. This Court held\n\nthat there was no hard and fast rule that death sentence could not be\n\nawarded if conviction was based on circumstantial evidence, but\n\nproceeded to commute death sentence into that of life imprisonment after\n\nfinding that the Trial Court and the High Court did not consider various\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_149\">                                      101</span>\n\ffactors including the probability of the petitioner to be reformed.

The law <a href=\"/doc/11788173/\" id=\"a_201\">laid down by</a> various decisions of this Court clearly\n        and unequivocally mandates that the probability (not possibility or\n        improbability or impossibility) that a convict can be reformed and\n        rehabilitated in society must be seriously and earnestly considered\n        by the courts before awarding the death sentence.

To effectuate this mandate, it is\n        the obligation on the prosecution to prove to the court, through\n        evidence, that the probability is that the convict cannot be\n        reformed or rehabilitated. This can be achieved by bringing on\n        record, inter alia, material about his conduct in jail, his conduct\n        outside jail if he has been on bail for some time, medical evidence\n        about his mental make-up, contact with his family and so on.\n        Similarly, the convict can produce evidence on these issues as\n        well.</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_91\">                           ***             ***           ***\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_92\">        47. Consideration of the reformation, rehabilitation and\n        reintegration of the convict into society cannot be\n        overemphasised. Until Bachan Singh, the emphasis given by the\n        courts was primarily on the nature of the crime, its brutality and\n        severity. Bachan Singh placed the sentencing process into\n        perspective and introduced the necessity of considering the\n        reformation or rehabilitation of the convict. Despite the view\n        expressed by the Constitution Bench, there have been several\n        instances… where there is a tendency to give primacy to the crime\n        and consider the criminal in a somewhat secondary manner. As\n        observed in Sangeet16 “In the sentencing process, both the crime\n        and the criminal are equally important.” Therefore, we should not\n        forget that the criminal, however ruthless he might be, is\n        nevertheless a human being and is entitled to a life of dignity\n        notwithstanding his crime. Therefore, it is for the prosecution and\n        the courts to determine whether such a person, notwithstanding\n        his crime, can be reformed and rehabilitated. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"174283964\" id=\"span_151\">To obtain and\n        analyse this information is certainly not an easy task but must\n        nevertheless be undertaken. The process of rehabilitation is also\n        not a simple one since it involves social reintegration of the convict\n        into society. Of course, notwithstanding any information made\n        available and its analysis by experts coupled with the evidence on\n        record, there could be instances where the social reintegration of\n        the convict may not be possible. If that should happen, the option\n        of a long duration of imprisonment is permissible.”\n\n\n\n16 <a href=\"/doc/174283964/\" id=\"a_203\">Sangeet and Anr. v.

The case was based on\n\ncircumstantial evidence, with the incriminating circumstances operating\n\nagainst the appellant being that he was last seen with the deceased while\n\nshe was walking home from school; he was later seen running alone in\n\nthe evening; the dead body and the incriminating articles like clothes of\n\nthe victim were recovered at his instance; mud stains on his pants\n\nmatched the mud stains seized from the spot; his failure to explain the\n\ninjuries found on his person; medical evidence showing that the victim\n\nhad been forcibly raped and killed; hiding the dead body to suppress\n\nevidence; and failure of the appellant to offer a plausible explanation for\n\nthe incriminating circumstances against him. While confirming the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_154\">                                    103</span>\n\fconviction of the appellant under other provisions as also the death\n\nsentence, the High Court set aside the conviction of the appellant under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/174845796/\" id=\"a_210\">Section 10</a> POCSO. As regards death sentence, this Court reiterated the\n\nprinciple that life imprisonment was the rule and death sentence was the\n\nexception, which was to be imposed only when the alternative of life\n\nimprisonment had been unquestionably foreclosed. This Court found that\n\neven though the crime committed by the appellant was abominable, it\n\ncould not be held to be falling within the ‘rarest of rare’. This Court also\n\nfound that the prosecution had been unable to prove that the appellant\n\ncould not be reformed and thus, commuted the sentence of death into\n\nthat of imprisonment for life without scope of remission for 20 years.\n\nThese findings of this Court could be usefully reproduced as under: -</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_93\">       “25. Though we agree that the crime committed is of an\n       abominable nature, it cannot be said to be of such a brutal,\n       depraved, heinous or diabolical nature so as to fall into the\n       category of the rarest of rare cases and invite punishment with\n       death. We also find ourselves unable to agree with the view of the\n       courts that the appellant is such a menace to society that he\n       cannot be allowed to stay alive. On the other hand, we are of the\n       view that the prosecution did not establish that the appellant was\n       beyond reform, especially given his young age. We are also\n       mindful of the appellant&#x27;s lack of criminal antecedents prior to the\n       commission of this crime, and of his post-incarceration conduct,\n       which in no way suggests the impossibility of his reform. It would\n       be pertinent to observe at this point that although the trial court\n       noted his lack of remorse during the hearing, and the High Court\n       noted his lack of remorse after committing the crime, as he was\n       found calmly wandering around the locality, this does not in any\n       way indicate that there is no scope of reform for the appellant.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_94\">       26. Thus, neither the circumstances of the crime nor the\n       circumstances of the criminal i.e. the appellant, would go to show\n       that the instant matter falls into the category of the rarest of rare\n       cases, or that the sentence of life imprisonment is unquestionably\n       foreclosed and grossly disproportionate. Therefore, in the totality\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_155\">                                      104</span>\n\f        of the facts and circumstances of this case, we find it fit to\n        commute the death sentence of the appellant to life imprisonment.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_95\">        27. At the same time, we are of the opinion that a sentence of life\n        imprisonment simpliciter would not be proportionate to the gravity\n        of the offence committed, and would not meet the need to respond\n        to crimes against women and children in the most stringent\n        manner possible. Moreover, though we have noticed above that\n        the possibility of reform of the accused is not completely\n        precluded, we nevertheless share the concerns of the trial court\n        and the High Court regarding the lack of remorse on behalf of the\n        appellant and the possibility of reoffending. In such a situation, we\n        deem it fit to restrict the right of the appellant to claim remission in\n        his sentence of life imprisonment for a period of 20 years.”\n\n45.2.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"28102290\" id=\"span_156\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/28102290/\" id=\"a_211\">Babasaheb Maruti Kamble</a> (supra), the appellant\n\nwas convicted of offences under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_212\">Sections 302</a>, <a href=\"/doc/334057/\" id=\"a_213\">376(2)(f)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1243353/\" id=\"a_214\">342</a> IPC and\n\nwas awarded death sentence for the offence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_215\">Section\n\n302</a> IPC.

The comparative review must be\n        undertaken not to channel the sentencing discretion available to\n        the courts but to bring in consistency in identification of various\n        relevant circumstances. The aggravating and mitigating\n        circumstances have to be separately identified under a rigorous\n        measure.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_102\">        133.

The weight which\n        is accorded by the court to particular aggravating and mitigating\n        circumstances may vary from case to case in the name of\n        individualised sentencing, but at the same time reasons for\n        apportionment of weights shall be forthcoming.

Presently, we shall proceed to dwell upon the manner in\n         which the crime was committed. Materials on record clearly reveal\n         that the appellant was well acquainted with the inhabitants of the\n         locality and as is demonstrable he had access to the house of the\n         father of the deceased and the children used to call him “uncle”.\n         He had lured the deceased to go with him to have chocolates. It is\n         an act of taking advantage of absolute innocence. He had taken\n         the deceased from place to place by his bicycle and eventually\n         raped her in a brutal manner, as if he had an insatiable and\n17 reported as (2015) 1 SCC 253.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_171\">                                       109</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_202\">\fravenous appetite. The injuries caused on the minor girl are likely\nto send a chill in the spine of the society and shiver in the marrows\nof human conscience. He had battered her to death by assaulting\nher with two heavy stones. The injured minor girl could not have\nshown any kind of resistance. It is not a case where the accused\nhad a momentary lapse. It is also not a case where the minor child\nhad died because of profuse bleeding due to rape but because of\nthe deliberate cruel assault by the appellant. After the savage act\nwas over, the coolness of the appellant is evident, for he washed\nthe clothes on the tap and took proper care to hide things. As is\nmanifest, he even did not think for a moment the trauma and\ntorture that was caused to the deceased. The gullibility and\nvulnerability of the four year girl, who could not have nurtured any\nidea about the maladroitly designed biological desires of this\nnature, went with the uncle who extinguished her life-spark. The\nbarbaric act of the appellant does not remotely show any concern\nfor the precious life of a young minor child who had really not seen\nlife. The criminality of the conduct of the appellant is not only\ndepraved and debased, but can have a menacing effect on the\nsociety. It is calamitous.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_203\">        ***                        ***                   ***\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_204\">60. In the case at hand, as we find, not only was the rape\ncommitted in a brutal manner but murder was also committed in a\nbarbaric manner. The rape of a minor girl child is nothing but a\nmonstrous burial of her dignity in the darkness. It is a crime\nagainst the holy body of a girl child and the soul of society and\nsuch a crime is aggravated by the manner in which it has been\ncommitted. The nature of the crime and the manner in which it has\nbeen committed speaks about its uncommonness. The crime\nspeaks of depravity, degradation and uncommonality. It is\ndiabolical and barbaric. The crime was committed in an inhuman\nmanner. Indubitably, these go a long way to establish the\naggravating circumstances.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_205\">61. We are absolutely conscious that mitigating circumstances are\nto be taken into consideration. The learned counsel for the\nappellant pointing out the mitigating circumstances would submit\nthat the appellant is in his mid-fifties and there is possibility of his\nreformation. Be it noted, the appellant was aged about forty-seven\nyears at the time of commission of the crime. As is noticeable,\nthere has been no remorse on the part of the appellant. There are\ncases when this Court has commuted the death sentence to life\nfinding that the accused has expressed remorse or the crime was\nnot premeditated. But the obtaining factual matrix when unfolded\nstage by stage would show the premeditation, the proclivity and\nthe rapacious desire. The learned counsel would submit that the\nappellant had no criminal antecedents but we find that he was a\nhistory-sheeter and had a number of cases pending against him.\nThat alone may not be sufficient. The appalling cruelty shown by\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_172\">                                110</span>\n\f         him to the minor girl child is extremely shocking and it gets\n         accentuated, when his age is taken into consideration. It was not\n         committed under any mental stress or emotional disturbance and it\n         is difficult to comprehend that he would not commit such acts and\n         would be reformed or rehabilitated. As the circumstances would\n         graphically depict, he would remain a menace to society, for a\n         defenceless child has become his prey. In our considered opinion,\n         there are no mitigating circumstances.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_206\">         62. As we perceive, this case deserves to fall in the category of\n         the rarest of rare cases. It is inconceivable from the perspective of\n         the society that a married man aged about two scores and seven\n         makes a four-year minor innocent girl child the prey of his lust and\n         deliberately causes her death. A helpless and defenceless child\n         gets raped and murdered because of the acquaintance of the\n         appellant with the people of the society. This is not only betrayal of\n         an individual trust but destruction and devastation of social trust. It\n         is perversity in its enormity. It irrefragably invites the extreme\n         abhorrence and indignation of the collective. It is an anathema to\n         the social balance. In our view, it meets the test of the rarest of the\n         rare case and we unhesitatingly so hold.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_207\">         63.

In the review petitions, several other mitigating circumstances\n\nwere projected before the Court including the qualifications acquired by\n\nthe accused during the pendency of the matter and the probability of his\n\nreformation. This Court found that the aggravating circumstances, i.e.,\n\nextreme depravity and barbaric manner of the crime outweighed the\n\nmitigating circumstances. Hence, while dismissing the review petitions,\n\nthis Court observed and concluded as under18: -\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_105\">         “21.

Be that as it may,\n\nwe may profitably refer to the relevant decisions to point out the approach\n\nof this Court towards this theory as also the fact that the propositions\n\nabout inapplicability of this theory have been clearly stated in the later\n\ndecisions, as discussed infra.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_211\">48.1.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"153553654\" id=\"span_177\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/153553654/\" id=\"a_236\">Ravishankar Alias Baba Vishwakarma v.

The\n\ncase had been that of circumstantial evidence and on the question of\n\nsentence, this Court examined as to whether death sentence was\n\njustified. Though this Court made it clear that even in the case where\n\nconviction is based on circumstantial evidence, capital punishment could\n\nbe awarded but then, proceeded to observe that this Court had been\n\nincreasingly applying the theory of ‘residual doubt’, which effectively\n\ncreate a higher standard of proof over and above the “beyond reasonable\n\ndoubt” standard used at the stage of conviction, as a safeguard against\n\nroutine capital sentencing, keeping in mind the irreversibility of death.\n\nApplying this theory and indicating certain ‘residual doubts’, it was held\n\nthat the said case fell short of ‘rarest of rare’ category; and the death\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_178\">                                    113</span>\n\fsentence was commuted into one of life for the remainder of the natural\n\nlife of the convict.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_212\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"17904216\" id=\"span_179\">48.2.

The\n\njudgment of conviction was pronounced on 28.09.2013 and the question\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_189\">                                        117</span>\n\fof sentence was taken up 3 clear days later, i.e., on 01.10.2013; and the\n\ndeath sentence was awarded only after duly hearing the accused-\n\nappellant, after duly taking into consideration the aggravating and\n\nmitigating factors, and while duly recording special reasons.\n\n50.2.   The heinous nature of the crime, like that of the present one, in\n\nbrutal rape and killing of a mentally and physically challenged girl, who\n\nwas only about seven-and-a-half-year-old, definitely carries excessively\n\naggravating circumstances, particularly when the manner of commission\n\nof both the major offences of rape and murder shows depravity of highest\n\norder and would ex facie shock anyone’s conscience. The horrific manner\n\nof killing the victim, by causing ghastly head injuries had been nothing\n\nless than beastly conduct of the appellant. However, as noticed,\n\ngruesome nature of the action and the crime, by itself, may not be\n\ndecisive, particularly as regards the question of capital punishment. Thus,\n\nwe need to cautiously examine the other relevant factors, particularly\n\nthose of the tests pertaining to the criminal himself.\n\n50.3.   Undoubtedly, the appellant was 28 years of age at the time of\n\ncommission of crime and was having family comprising of his wife, an\n\neight-year-old daughter and parents. He is not shown to be coming from\n\nany affluent background but, at the same time, it is also not shown if he\n\ncomes from a very poor socio-economic background. Taken as a whole,\n\nthese factors of the age, family and socio-economic background of the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_190\">                                     118</span>\n\fappellant are not so clinching as to overwhelm and override the\n\naggravating factors.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_219\">50.3.1. Then, the pertinent question is as to whether there exists a\n\nreasonable probability of reformation and rehabilitation of the appellant?\n\nIf the answer to this material question is in the affirmative, it may have\n\nbearing upon the test to find if the case falls in rarest of rare category.\n\nBut, if there are factors which operate against affirmative answer to this\n\nquestion on the probability of reformation and rehabilitation, the\n\naggravating circumstances would assuredly outweigh the mitigating\n\ncircumstances warranting capital punishment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_220\">50.4.   In regard to the above, the facts emerging from record are as\n\nfollows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_111\">50.4.1. It is noticed that before the Trial Court, a suggestion was made\n\nwhile pleading leniency for the appellant, that it was his first offence. This\n\nsuggestion, however, does not appear to be correct. It is noticeable from\n\nthe contents of the charge-sheet that in the process of residence\n\nverification, it was found that the appellant was hailing from village\n\nBasantpur, Police Station Gugli, District Maharajganj, Uttar Pradesh; and\n\nit came to the light that he had had a history of criminal cases inasmuch\n\nas, he was charge-sheeted in Case No. 69 of 2011 of Police Station\n\nShambhupura, District Chittorgarh for offence under <a href=\"/doc/126810723/\" id=\"a_250\">Section 3</a> of\n\nPrevention of Damage to Public Property Act, 1984 and 307 <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_251\">IPC</a>. He was\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_191\">                                     119</span>\n\falso involved in Police Station Kankroli 20 Case Nos. 78 of 2012 and 79 of\n\n2012 for offence under <a href=\"/doc/1101188/\" id=\"a_252\">Section 379</a> IPC; and in Police Station Rajnagar\n\nCase No. 428 of 2012 for offence under <a href=\"/doc/1101188/\" id=\"a_253\">Section 379</a> IPC.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_112\">50.4.2. There is another crucial fact having direct co-relation and\n\nconnection with the present case itself, which emanates from the\n\nstatement of PW-23 Ramdev Regar, Sub-Inspector, Police Line,\n\nRajsamand. He testified to the fact that on 14.01.2013, a written report\n\nabout the theft of Hero Honda Passion Plus motorcycle bearing\n\nregistration No. RJ30 3M 5944 was filed at Police Station Nathdwara,\n\nwhereupon, FIR bearing No. 39 of 2013 was registered for offence under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1101188/\" id=\"a_254\">Section 379</a> IPC against unknown person. Significantly, the said\n\nmotorcycle bearing registration No. RJ30 3M 5944 was the same one\n\nwhich was used by the appellant in the present crime. This motorcycle\n\nwas recovered near the scene of crime at the information of the appellant;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_221\">and bloodstains were also collected therefrom; and DNA profile of those\n\nbloodstains matched the DNA profile of the blood samples of the victim\n\ngirl.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_222\">50.5.    Thus, the facts surfacing on record make it clear that the crime in\n\nquestion was not the singular criminal activity of the appellant. The\n\nantecedents of the appellant depict a person whose conduct had not\n\nbeen free from blemish and, in any case, he committed the crimes of\n\nkidnapping as also murder of the victim girl with the use of a vehicle\n\n\n20 The same police station which has dealt with the present case.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_192\">                                             120</span>\n\fwhich did not belong to him but was a stolen one 21. In other words, the\n\npast of the appellant before the present case had been of involvement in\n\ncriminal cases; and abhorrent crimes of the present case were committed\n\nby him with the aid of a stolen vehicle. These facts and factors magnify\n\nthe aggravating circumstances manifold.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_223\">51.      In view of what has been noticed hereinabove, the net result of\n\ncrime test and criminal test could be summarised as follows: The present\n\ncase had been of extreme inhumane acts and actions of the appellant\n\nwhere, amongst other offending acts and actions, he (1) kidnapped the\n\nvictim girl, who was only 7½ years of age, who was even otherwise a\n\nmentally and physically challenged child, with betrayal of trust when the\n\nvictim girl got lured with confectionary items given by him; (2) brutally\n\nraped the victim girl, as noticeable from the gruesome injuries on and\n\naround her private parts and as established by the medical officers who\n\nconducted post-mortem; and (3) mercilessly killed the victim girl by\n\ncausing horrid injuries on her head, as established not only by the doctors\n\nbut also by the surrounding facts, including bloodstains on the scene of\n\ncrime, on the motorcycle, and on the clothing of the appellant at the time\n\nof his arrest. On the personal score, even though the appellant was about\n\n28 years of age and was having the family of wife, a daughter who was\n\nalso about 8 years of age and aged parents, he was continuously\n\ninvolved in criminal activities. Even if the other past cases are left aside,\n21 As per the evidence of PW-23 Ramdev Regar, the report about theft of the motorcycle in\nquestion was lodged at Police Station Nathdwara on 14.01.2013 i.e., 3 days before the incident\nof the present case.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_193\">                                            121</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_224\">\n\fhe committed the crimes in question by using a stolen motorcycle.\n\nUnfortunately, the matter does not end here.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_225\">51.1.    The tremors thrown by the appellant to shock anyone’s\n\nconscience with his beastly conduct have not stopped even with this\n\ninhumane crime and even after his conviction.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_226\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"181505792\" id=\"span_194\">52.      As noticed, in a substantial number of cases, when nothing further\n\nexacerbates the crime in question, the Courts have refrained from\n\nawarding or approving death sentence even in the cases of gruesome\n\nkillings, essentially on the premise that even a semblance of probability of\n\nreformation of the convict ought to be given a chance, rather than\n\nawarding capital punishment, which is of irretrievable nature. In this\n\nregard, the jail conduct of the convict carries its own bearing and\n\nrelevance in the overall consideration; and this Court has leaned in favour\n\nof commuting the sentence of death to that of imprisonment for life in\n\ncase of unblemished jail conduct, even if the crime itself had been of\n\ngruesome or abhorrent nature22-23. However, in the present case, the\n\nfurther shocking and disturbing factor is that even while in jail, the\n\n22 The case of <a href=\"/doc/181505792/\" id=\"a_255\">Pappu v. The State of Uttar Pradesh</a>: Criminal Appeal Nos. 1097-1098 of\n2018 decided on 09.02.2022 by us is directly an illustration of this approach where, despite\nfinding it to be similar case of gruesome rape and murder of a seven-year-old girl child, we\nfound the unblemished jail conduct coupled with other circumstances indicating the probability\nof reformation of the convict and hence, commuted the death sentence into that of imprisonment\nfor life but with stipulations of his undergoing actual imprisonment for a period of 30 years.</span>\n\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"31029978\" id=\"span_195\">23 The case of <a href=\"/doc/31029978/\" id=\"a_256\">Veerendra v. State of Madhya Pradesh</a>: Criminal Appeal Nos. 5-6 of 2018\ndecided on 13.05.2022 by us is another direct illustration of this approach where, despite\nfinding it to be similar case of gruesome rape and murder of an eight-year-old girl child, who\nwas daughter of the cousin of the convict, we observed that the convict’s unblemished jail\nconduct coupled with other mitigating circumstances would not go unnoticed; and probability of\nreformation and rehabilitation of the convict was not ruled out. Hence, we again adopted the\ncourse of commuting the death sentence into that of imprisonment for life with stipulations of\nactual imprisonment for a period of 30 years.</span>\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_196\">                                            122</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_227\">\n\fappellant’s conduct has not been free from blemish where, apart from\n\nquarrelling with other inmate on 17.04.2015 and earning 7 days’\n\npunishment, the appellant had been accused and convicted of the offence\n\nof yet another murder, this time of a co-inmate of the jail, while joining\n\nhands with three other inmates.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_228\">53.    At this juncture, we may again point out that the fact regarding the\n\nappellant’s involvement in another murder while being in jail and his\n\nconviction of the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_257\">Section 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_258\">34</a> IPC came to be stated\n\nonly in the written submissions filed on behalf of the respondent-State\n\nafter conclusion of hearing. Such a fact having not been specified during\n\nthe course of hearing, we posted the matter for further directions and, on\n\n14.02.2022, the State was directed to place the relevant facts on record\n\nwith affidavit of the officer concerned. In compliance thereof, an affidavit\n\nof Rakesh Mohan Sharma, Superintendent, Central Jail, Jaipur has been\n\nfiled and a copy of judgment and order dated 10.01.2020 in Sessions\n\nCase No. 204 of 2019 by the Court of Special Judge (Prevention of Sati)\n\nand Additional Sessions Judge, Jaipur Metropolitan has also been filed. A\n\nperusal of the material placed on record makes it clear that the appellant,\n\nwith three other jail inmates, has been convicted by the Trial Court of the\n\noffence under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_259\">Section 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_260\">34</a> IPC for murder of another jail inmate, who\n\nwas a Pakistani national in the high security cell of the prison; and that\n\nthe appellant has been awarded the sentence of imprisonment for life.\n\nThough it has been pointed out that an appeal against <a href=\"/doc/31029978/\" id=\"a_261\">the said decision</a> is\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_197\">                                    123</span>\n\fpending and we would not be making any comments on the merits of that\n\ncase at all but, the appellant’s culpable conduct in jail compels us to\n\nponder over the question as to whether it would be realistic to believe on\n\nthe probability of his reformation and rehabilitation yet.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_229\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"307021\" id=\"span_198\">54.    We may also observe that even though rarest of rare doctrine and\n\nits accompanying principles, as enunciated and explained in <a href=\"/doc/307021/\" id=\"a_262\">Bachan\n\nSingh and Machhi Singh</a> (supra), have been almost uniformly applied by\n\nCourts in the country while dealing with the question of sentencing when\n\nthe statute provides for death penalty; and over the time, even the\n\nproposition of larger/longer term of actual imprisonment with no remission\n\nor curtailed remission has also evolved but, it has never been the effort of\n\nthe Courts to somehow make this punishment (sentence of death)\n\nredundant and non-existent for all practical purposes. The quest for\n\njustice in such cases, with death sentence being awarded and maintained\n\nonly in extreme cases, does not mean that the matter would be\n\napproached and examined in the manner that death sentence has be\n\navoided, even if the matter indeed calls for such a punishment. The\n\njudicial process, in our view, would be compromising on its objectivity if\n\nthe approach is to nullify the statutory provision carrying death sentence\n\nas an alternative punishment for major offences (like that of <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_263\">Section 302</a>\n\nIPC), even after it has passed muster of judicial scrutiny and has been\n\nheld   not   unconstitutional.   The    pursuit    in   collecting   mitigating\n\ncircumstances could also not be taken up with any notion or idea that\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_199\">                                     124</span>\n\fsomehow, some factor be found; or if not found, be deduced anyhow so\n\nthat the sentence of death be forsaken. Such an approach would be\n\nunrealistic, unwarranted and rather not upholding the rule of law.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_230\">55.       An attempt has been made to suggest on behalf of the appellant\n\nthat his overall conduct in prison is without any blemish except the\n\nallegation of his involvement in a case of murder. We could only wonder\n\nwhat more of criminal activity would qualify as blemish, if not the\n\ninvolvement and conviction in a case of murder of a fellow jail inmate!\n\nThis is apart from the other 7 days’ punishment earned by the appellant\n\nfor quarrelling with another jail inmate.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_231\">56.       We may also take into account another suggestion made on\n\nbehalf of the appellant that his psychological evaluation report may be\n\ncalled.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_232\">56.1.     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"151550237\" id=\"span_200\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/151550237/\" id=\"a_264\">Anil @ Anthony Arikswamy Joseph v. State of\n\nMaharashtra</a>: 2014 (4) SCC 69, this Court observed that in appropriate\n\ncases, after conviction, the Court may call for report to determine whether\n\nthe accused could be reformed or rehabilitated; and it would depend on\n\nthe facts and circumstances of each case24. Again, there cannot be any\n\nuniversal formula for calling for a report in terms of <a href=\"/doc/151550237/\" id=\"a_265\">the said decision</a> in\n\nAnil. For example, in the present case, where the appellant is found to be\n\nindulging incessantly in criminal activities before the crime in question;\n\nhas carried out gruesome deeds of the present crime; has further been\n\n\n24 Vide paragraph 33, SCC p. 86.</span>\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_201\">                                     125</span><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_233\">\n\finvolved in questionable jail conduct, including quarrelling with a fellow\n\ninmate and earning 7 days’ punishment; and then, to cap it all, has been\n\ninvolved in an offence of no less degree than murder of another jail\n\ninmate, calling for any further report of the likelihood of reformation and\n\nrehabilitation of the appellant could be proposed only if the judicial\n\nprocess is determined to annul the death sentence altogether, by finding\n\none way or the other to avoid the same in every case. Such an approach\n\nwould be counter-productive to the entire system of maintenance of order\n\nin the society; and could be countenanced only if we would be inclined to\n\nthink that whatever be the society’s cry for justice, the statutory provision\n\nof death sentence should itself be given its interment or burial. Obviously,\n\nthis approach would be squarely contrary to the statutory mandates as\n\nalso the principles enunciated by multiple Constitution Bench decisions of\n\nthis Court; and would strike at the roots of the rule of law. In the given set\n\nof circumstances of this case, the suggestions about calling for any so-\n\ncalled psychological evaluation report could only be termed as impractical\n\nand unrealistic and could only be rejected.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_234\">57.    In the present case, where all the elements surrounding the\n\noffence as also all the elements surrounding the offender cut across the\n\nbalance sheet of aggravating and mitigating circumstances, we are\n\nclearly of the view that there is absolutely no reason to commute the\n\nsentence of death to any other sentence of lesser degree. Even the\n\nalternative of awarding the sentence of imprisonment for whole of the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_202\">                                     126</span>\n\fnatural life with no remission does not appear justified in view of the\n\nnature of crimes committed by the appellant and looking to his incorrigible\n\nconduct.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_235\">58.    We may sum up thus: In the case of the present nature, the crime\n\nhad been of extreme depravity, which shocks the conscience, particularly\n\nlooking to the target (a seven-and-a-half-year old mentally and physically\n\nchallenged girl) and then, looking to the manner of committing murder,\n\nwhere the hapless victim’s head was literally smashed, resulting in\n\nmultiple injuries including fracture of frontal bone. This is apart from the\n\nfacts that the innocent victim was kidnapped on a stolen motorcycle by\n\nmisusing the trust gained by offer of confectionary items and also, apart\n\nfrom the fact that she was brutally and inhumanly raped. Taking up the\n\ntest parameters pertaining to the criminal (i.e., the appellant), of course,\n\nhe has a family with wife and minor daughter and aged father and the\n\ncrime was committed when he was only 28 years of age. However, these\n\nmitigating factors are pitted against several other factors pertaining to the\n\nappellant himself. One, being of his activities and actions before the\n\npresent crime where he was found involved in at least four cases with\n\noffences ranging from <a href=\"/doc/126810723/\" id=\"a_266\">Section 3</a> of Prevention of Damage to Public\n\nProperty Act, 1984, <a href=\"/doc/1101188/\" id=\"a_267\">Section 379</a> IPC and even 307 <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_268\">IPC</a>. Second, being\n\nthe fact that the present crime itself was carried out with the aid of a\n\nstolen motorcycle. Third, and crucial one being his conduct post-\n\nconviction where he not only earned 7 days’ punishment in jail for\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_203\">                                    127</span>\n\fquarrelling with a co-inmate but he has been convicted of the offence of\n\nmurder of another jail inmate. Read as a whole, the fact-sheet concerning\n\nthe appellant leads only the logical deduction that there is no possibility\n\nthat he would not relapse again in this crime if given any indulgence. A\n\nfortiori, there appears no probability of his reformation and rehabilitation.\n\nThis possibility of the appellant relapsing in the same crime over again\n\nand nil probability of his reformation/rehabilitation is a direct challenge as\n\nalso danger to the maintenance of order in the society. Hence, the facts of\n\nthe present case, taken as a whole, make it clear that it is unlikely that the\n\nappellant, if given an absolution, would not be capable of and would not\n\nbe inclined to commit such a crime again. Consequently, we find it to be a\n\ncase of no other option but to confirm the death sentence awarded to the\n\nappellant, for that being inevitable in this particular case.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_236\">59.     Before concluding on this matter, we deem it appropriate to put on\n\nrecord our appreciation for the learned senior counsel appearing in legal\n\naid for the appellant who, despite having a tough brief to handle, has\n\nattempted his best to espouse the cause of the appellant.\n\nConclusion\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_237\">60.
