This petition is directed against the order dated 21 st March 2009 passed\n\nby the learned Metropolitan Magistrate („MM‟) dismissing CC No. 4167\n\nof 2009 titled <a href=\"/doc/61399578/\" id=\"a_1\">HDFC Bank Limited v. Amit Kumar Singh</a> under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_2\">Section\n\n138</a> of the Negotiable Instruments Act 1881 („<a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_3\">NI Act</a>‟).</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">2. The short question that arises for consideration is whether the learned\n\nMM, while entertaining a complaint under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 138</a> NI Act, at the pre-\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">Crl.Rev.P. No. 296/2009                                       Page 1 of 21</span>\n summoning stage, can insist upon the complainant producing some proof\n\nof despatch of the notice in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_5\">NI Act</a> sent to the drawer of the\n\ndishonoured cheque.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">3. The aforementioned complaint was filed in respect of dishonour of a\n\ncheque No. 763884 drawn on Punjab &amp; Sind Bank, Jangpura Extension,\n\nNew Delhi dated 5th December 2008 for Rs.19,083/- drawn by the\n\nRespondent in favour of the Petitioner HDFC Bank Limited („Bank‟).\n\nThe cheque when presented for payment was dishonored with the\n\nremarks &quot;Funds insufficient&quot;. It was stated in the complaint filed by the\n\nBank under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 138</a> NI Act that upon receipt of intimation from the\n\nBank to which the cheque was presented that it was dishonored, a legal\n\nnotice was sent to the drawer at the address available in the records of the\n\nBank. The complainant stated that the said notice &quot;was sent/posted to the\n\naccused on 14th January 2009, by registered A/D post at his above-stated\n\naddress as the same was duly provided time and again&quot;. The cover was\n\nnot received back. It was claimed that &quot;thus the said notice has been duly\n\nserved upon the accused. But in spite of the service of the said notice on\n\nthe accused as aforesaid, the accused intentionally failed to show the\n\npositive response and also failed to make the payment of the aforesaid\n\ndishonored cheques to the complainant within the stipulated time&quot;.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_8\">4. The question that arose before the learned MM was whether it could be\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">Crl.Rev.P. No. 296/2009                                     Page 2 of 21</span>\n said that the legal notice issued to the drawer of the dishonored cheque,\n\nwas in fact served on the drawer. The question arose in the clauses of the\n\nprecise wording of <a href=\"/doc/1440901/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 138(c)</a> NI Act where one of the conditions for\n\nthe offence to be attracted is that the drawer the cheque should fail to\n\nmake the payment to the payee &quot;within fifteen days of the receipt of the\n\nsaid notice&quot;. Therefore, the receipt of the notice by the payee is an\n\nessential condition which must be fulfilled followed by the failure of the\n\ndrawee to make payment within 15 days thereafter. Although <a href=\"/doc/1240817/\" id=\"a_8\">Section\n\n138 (b)</a> NI Act states that &quot;the payee has to only give a notice in writing\n\nto the drawer&quot;. Can it be said that by merely giving such notice, the\n\nsubsequent stage of receipt of such notice by the drawer is automatically\n\nto be presumed?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\">5. It was urged before the learned MM by the petitioner that since the\n\nnotice was sent by registered post, <a href=\"/doc/1428703/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 27</a> of the General Clauses Act,\n\n1897 <a href=\"/doc/905940/\" id=\"a_10\">(GC Act</a>) can be invoked and a presumption drawn that service has\n\nbeen effected. Reliance was placed inter alia on the judgments of the\n\nSupreme Court in K. Bhaskaran v. Sankaran Vaidhyan Balan AIR 1999\n\nSC 3782 and C.C. Alavi Haji v. Palapetty Muhammed (2007) 6 SCC\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\">555. Reliance was also placed in <a href=\"/doc/992144/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 94</a> NI Act to contend that once\n\nthe notice of dishonor has been given by post then it would satisfy the\n\nrequirement even of <a href=\"/doc/1240817/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 138 (b)</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/1440901/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 138(c)</a> NI Act.\n\nImportantly, the learned MM noted at the outset that the counsel for the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">Crl.Rev.P. No. 296/2009                                    Page 3 of 21</span>\n complainant had argued that there was no need to file any delivery report\n\nor the acknowledgement due card or proof of delivery of the demand\n\nnotice sent by Speed Post/Registered Post.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_13\">6. The learned MM discussed the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1428703/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 27</a> GC Act with\n\n<a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 114</a> Indian Evidence Act (EA). It is held that the presumption of\n\nservice of notice cannot be automatically drawn unless the petitioner was\n\nable to show to the Court a delivery report, or a signed acknowledgement\n\ndue card or the Internet generated report or any such proof of delivery.\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">7. After discussing the case law, the learned MM concluded that the\n\nprovision of deemed service would be attracted only where, despite\n\naddressing the notice to the correct address, the accused is shown to have\n\nrefused service of the demand notice. Further the presumption could be\n\nraised only where the complainant/petitioner files an affidavit stating that\n\nthe accused is in fact residing at the same address to which the notice was\n\nsent. Without such an affidavit being filed, it would be unsafe for the\n\nCourt to presume service of the notice. Cognizance of the offence under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 138</a> NI Act could not be taken on the basis of presumption.\n\nMerely because, as in the instant case, after having sent the notice by\n\nregistered post, the complainant has not received any intimation\n\nwhatsoever and has not received the notice back unserved, a presumption\n\ncould not be drawn that it had been duly served on the drawer/addressee.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">Crl.Rev.P. No. 296/2009                                     Page 4 of 21</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_15\"> 8. In the circumstances, since no affidavit was also filed by the\n\ncomplainant stating that the accused was in fact residing at the address\n\ngiven in the notice, it was held that the essential condition for taking\n\ncognizance of the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 138</a> NI Act was not satisfied.\n\nThe complaint was accordingly dismissed. It may also be mentioned that\n\non the basis of the impugned order, fourteen other similar complaints\n\nfiled by the petitioner were also dismissed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_16\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_17\">9. Counsel for the petitioner urges that the learned MM erred in not\n\ndrawing the presumption under <a href=\"/doc/1428703/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 27</a> of the GC Act. He submitted\n\nthat at the pre-summoning stage, it was not mandatory to prove delivery\n\nof notice sent by registered post to the accused and the presumption\n\nshould be in favour of the complainant. Otherwise, several unscrupulous\n\ndrawers who would easily escape liability without making payment after\n\ngiving a wrong address. The very object of introducing the penal\n\nprovision would be defeated.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_18\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_19\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"272690\" id=\"span_8\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"529907\" id=\"span_9\">10. He referred to the observations of the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/529907/\" id=\"a_19\">K.\n\nBhaskaran v. Sankaran Vaidya Balan</a> as well as <a href=\"/doc/272690/\" id=\"a_20\">C.C. Alavi Haji v.\n\nPalapetty Muhammed</a>. As long as the complaint contained the basic fact\n\nregarding the mode and manner of issuance of notice to the drawer of\n\ncheque, the court should hold that the requirement of <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 138</a> NI Act\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">Crl.Rev.P. No. 296/2009                                  Page 5 of 21</span>\n was satisfied and consequently cognizance should be taken of the\n\noffence. He referred to <a href=\"/doc/992144/\" id=\"a_22\">Sections 94</a>, <a href=\"/doc/517539/\" id=\"a_23\">118</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_24\">138</a> and <a href=\"/doc/268919/\" id=\"a_25\">139</a> NI Act as well as\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1485731/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 3</a>, <a href=\"/doc/114119/\" id=\"a_27\">114</a> of the EA read with <a href=\"/doc/1428703/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 27</a> of GC Act to contend that\n\nthe presumption of service of notice should be drawn since the legal\n\nnotice was sent by registered post to the drawer at the address of the\n\ndrawer as available in the records of the complainant. The contention of\n\nthe petitioner is that since the legal notice was sent by properly\n\naddressing the drawer at the address available in the records of the\n\ncomplainant, the complainant had discharged its part in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1240817/\" id=\"a_29\">Section\n\n138 (b)</a> NI Act. Counsel for the petitioner referred to <a href=\"/doc/992144/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 94</a> NI Act\n\nand submitted that once the notice was sent by post, it would amount to a\n\nnotice of dishonor in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 138</a> NI Act as well. It is submitted\n\nthat the learned MM urged in holding that <a href=\"/doc/992144/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 94</a> applies only in a\n\nsituation where civil liability is sought to be enforced.</span></span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_20\">11. Counsel then refers to <a href=\"/doc/24813438/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 144</a> NI Act which states that the\n\nsummons to the accused or to a witness could be sent by Speed Post or\n\nby such courier service approved by the Court and when an\n\nacknowledgement purported to be signed by the accused has been\n\nreceived, the Court can declare the summons duly served. It is submitted\n\nthat the stage of <a href=\"/doc/24813438/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 144</a> NI Act would be reached only at the time of\n\nthe issuance of summons to the accused and cannot apply to the earlier\n\nstage of service of a legal notice by the complainant upon the drawer.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">Crl.Rev.P. No. 296/2009                                     Page 6 of 21</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\"> 12. Finally, it was submitted that if the learned MM was of the view that\n\nthe complainant should file an affidavit stating that the accused was\n\nresiding at the given address, one more opportunity should have been\n\ngiven to the complainant to place such an affidavit on record and\n\nthereafter cognizance ought to have been taken.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_22\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_23\">13. In order to appreciate the submissions of the learned counsel for the\n\npetitioner, the provisions of the law may first be noticed.\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_24\">14. <a href=\"/doc/1240817/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 138 (b)</a> NI Act is unambiguous in requiring a demand in\n\nwriting to be made by the payee by &quot;giving a notice in writing to the\n\ndrawer of the cheque within 30 days of receipt of intimation that the\n\ncheque has dishonored.&quot; The expression &quot;giving of notice&quot; has to be\n\nread in the context of <a href=\"/doc/1428703/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 27</a> of the GC Act. In terms of the said\n\nprovision whenever a statute uses the words &quot;served&quot; or &quot;give&quot; or &quot;sent&quot;\n\nunless a different intention appears, service would be presumed\n\n&quot;properly&quot; addressing, numbering and posting by registered post a letter\n\ncontaining the document. Unless the contrary is proved, service would be\n\ndeemed to have been effected at that time at which the letter would be\n\ndelivered in the ordinary course.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_25\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_26\">15. There can be no doubt that <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 138</a> has been introduced into the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">Crl.Rev.P. No. 296/2009                                       Page 7 of 21</span>\n <a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_38\">NI Act</a> as a penal provision. <a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_39\">The NI Act</a> was otherwise not a criminal law\n\nstatute. <a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_40\">Chapter XVII NI Act</a> was introduced to make the dishonor of the\n\ncheque for insufficiency of funds a punishable offence. The object of the\n\nintroduction of Chapter XVII was no doubt to have a deterrent effect on\n\nunscrupulous drawers of cheques who were issuing cheques thus without\n\nany intention of making payment. <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_41\">Sections 138</a> to <a href=\"/doc/177946336/\" id=\"a_42\">147</a> NI Act are\n\ncriminal law provisions and have, therefore, to be strictly construed. At\n\nthe outset, this Court therefore, rejects the plea that the principles\n\ninforming <a href=\"/doc/992144/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 94</a> NI Act regarding notice of dishonour of a cheque\n\nshould be incorporated pro tanto into <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_44\">Sections 138</a> to <a href=\"/doc/177946336/\" id=\"a_45\">147</a> NI Act.\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_27\">16. The above legal position is consistent with the legislative intent of the\n\nParliament in enacting <a href=\"/doc/24813438/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 144</a> NI Act. Although this provision talks\n\nof the mode of service of summons to either a witness or an accused\n\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_47\">NI Act</a>, this Court finds no reason why the same standard\n\nshould not be insisted upon for service of legal notice upon the accused\n\nby the complainant prior to the filing of the complaint. The reason for\n\nthis is that whenever a summoning order is passed and summons are sent\n\nto the accused, it would be sent at the same address shown for the\n\naccused in the complaint. This address ought not to be any different from\n\nthe address in the legal notice. It is therefore a continuous chain of\n\nevents. First there is a dishonor of the cheque. Next is the legal notice to\n\nbe sent to the drawer within 30 days of the payee receiving an intimation\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">Crl.Rev.P. No. 296/2009                                      Page 8 of 21</span>\n from the Bank of the dishonor of the cheque. Such legal notice in writing\n\nhas to be addressed to the drawer at the address of the drawer available\n\nwith the complainant such notice. Such notice has to be received by the\n\ndrawer and he should fail to make payment within 15 days after receipt of\n\nsuch notice. This chain thereafter continues into the next stage following\n\nthe failure to make the payment. The complainant or the drawee then\n\napproaches the criminal court with a complaint in which he will implead\n\nas the accused, the drawer of the cheque, with the address being shown as\n\nthe same to which the legal notice was sent. The summon, therefore, goes\n\nto the same address.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_29\">17. In a situation where there is no proof of delivery submitted before the\n\nCourt to show that the legal notice has in fact been received by the\n\naccused if a presumption is to be drawn and after taking cognizance\n\nsummons are issued to the accused at the same address, it would either\n\nnot be received back at all or received back with the remarks that the\n\naccused is not available at the address. Thereafter no further progress can\n\nbe made in the criminal complaint. This is an outcome that ought to be\n\navoided. Therefore, the appropriate course to be adopted, which is also\n\nthe more practical one, is to insist on the same standard of proof of\n\nservice of the legal notice as that envisaged under <a href=\"/doc/24813438/\" id=\"a_48\">Section 144</a> NI Act in\n\nthe context of summons.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">Crl.Rev.P.

It\n\nis plain from <a href=\"/doc/11680270/\" id=\"a_63\">Section 144(2)</a> that summons to a person, who is arraigned\n\nas an accused in a complaint under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_64\">Section 138</a> NI Act, when sent by\n\nregistered A/D post has to be followed by placing before the Court either\n\nthe signed acknowledgement due card purported to be signed by the\n\naddressee, or an endorsement by the postal department or the courier\n\nservice that the accused refused to take delivery of the summons. In the\n\nabsence of such acknowledgement or endorsement of the postal authority\n\nor the courier services, the Court will not draw a presumption that such\n\nsummons have been duly served. In the concerned view of this Court\n\ntherefore, the learned MM was in the instant case perfectly justified in\n\ninsisting that the complainant should show to the Court either the\n\nacknowledgement due card signed by the addressee or the postal\n\nendorsement to the effect that the accused refused to take delivery of the\n\nnotice. This will be minimum requirement in terms of the <a href=\"/doc/1240817/\" id=\"a_65\">Section 138(b)</a>\n\nthat must be satisfied by the complainant to show that the notice was in\n\nfact sent to the accused at the correct address.</span></span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_33\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_34\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"529907\" id=\"span_19\">20. In K. Bhaskaran, the Supreme Court was dealing with a case where\n\nnotice had been returned unclaimed. It was in that context that the Court\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">Crl.Rev.P. No. 296/2009                                   Page 11 of 21</span>\n had posed a question: whether there was difference between a notice\n\nwhich has been returned unclaimed or a notice that has been returned\n\nafter having been refused by the accused? In that context, it was stated\n\nthat the principle incorporated in <a href=\"/doc/1428703/\" id=\"a_66\">Section 27</a> of the GC Act can\n\n&quot;profitably be imported in such a case&quot;. It was held that in that situation\n\nthe deeming provision of <a href=\"/doc/1428703/\" id=\"a_67\">Section 27</a> of the GC Act would be attracted\n\nand it would be for the drawer (noticee) to prove that it was not really\n\nserved and that he was not responsible for such non-service. The key\n\nfactor is to be noted in <a href=\"/doc/529907/\" id=\"a_68\">Bhaskaran</a>&#x27;s case that the court had before it the\n\nreturned registered postal cover. In the instant case, however, nothing\n\nhas been heard by the complainant after sending the notice by registered\n\npost. The notice has not been returned unserved. No proof of delivery\n\nreport has been filed. There is no postal endorsement or certificate by the\n\ncourier service agency to the effect that the noticee refused service.</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_35\">21. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"844480\" id=\"span_21\">In <a href=\"/doc/844480/\" id=\"a_69\">D. Vinod Shivappa v. Nanda Belliappa</a> (2006) 6 SCC 456 the\n\nSupreme Court discussed in detail the rationale behind the provision and\n\nenvisaged three possible situations (SCC, p.462):</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">       &quot;If a notice is issued and served upon the drawer of the cheque, no\n       controversy arises. Similarly if the notice is refused by the\n       addressee, it may be presumed to have been served. This is also not\n       disputed. This leaves us with the third situation where the notice\n       could not be served on the addressee for one or the other\n       reason, such as his non-availability at the time of delivery, or\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">Crl.Rev.P. No. 296/2009                                      Page 12 of 21</span>\n        premises remaining locked on account of his having gone\n       elsewhere, etc. etc. If in each such case the law is understood to\n       mean that there has been no service of notice, it would completely\n       defeat the very purpose of the Act. It would then be very easy for\n       an unscrupulous and dishonest drawer of a cheque to make himself\n       scarce for some time after issuing the cheque so that the requisite\n       statutory notice can never be served upon him and consequently he\n       can never be prosecuted. There is good authority to support the\n       proposition that once the complainant, the payee of the cheque,\n       issues notice to the drawer of the cheque, the cause of action to file\n       a complaint arises on the expiry of the period prescribed for\n       payment by the drawer of the cheque. If he does not file a\n       complaint within one month of the date on which the cause of\n       action arises under clause (c) of the proviso to <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_70\">Section 138</a> of the\n       Act, his complaint gets barred by time. Thus, a person who can\n       dodge the postman for about a month or two, or a person who\n       can get a fake endorsement made regarding his non-\n       availability can successfully avoid his prosecution because the\n       payee is bound to issue notice to him within a period of 30 days\n       from the date of receipt of information from the bank\n       regarding the return of the cheque as unpaid. He is, therefore,\n       bound to issue the legal notice which may be returned with an\n       endorsement that the addressee is not available on the given\n       address.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">       15. We cannot also lose sight of the fact that the drawer may by\n       dubious means manage to get an incorrect endorsement made on\n       the envelope that the premises has been found locked or that the\n       addressee was not available at the time when postman went for\n       delivery of the letter. It may be that the address is correct and\n       even the addressee is available but a wrong endorsement is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">Crl.Rev.P. No. 296/2009                                      Page 13 of 21</span>\n        manipulated by the addressee. In such a case, if the facts are\n       proved, it may amount to refusal of the notice. If the\n       complainant is able to prove that the drawer of the cheque\n       knew about the notice and deliberately evaded service and got\n       a false endorsement made only to defeat the process of law, the\n       court shall presume service of notice. This, however, is a\n       matter of evidence and proof. Thus even in a case where the\n       notice is returned with the endorsement that the premises has\n       always been found locked or the addressee was not available at the\n       time of postal delivery, it will be open to the complainant to prove\n       at the trial by evidence that the endorsement is not correct and that\n       the addressee, namely, the drawer of the cheque, with knowledge\n       of the notice had deliberately avoided to receive notice.&quot; (emphasis\n       supplied)\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\">22. The important aspect to note in the above discussion as far as the\n\npresent case is concerned is the insistence by the Court that there must be\n\nsome endorsement on the postal cover of the noticee having left, or not\n\nbeing found or refusing service of notice. The facts in D.Vinod Shivappa\n\nwere that the legal notice sent to the drawer of the dishonoured cheque by\n\nregistered post was returned unserved with an endorsement &quot;Party not in\n\nstation, arrival not known&quot;. That was again not a case where nothing had\n\nbeen heard from the postal department after the notice was dispatched. It\n\nwas in those circumstances that the Supreme Court held that <a href=\"/doc/1887096/\" id=\"a_71\">Section 27</a>\n\nGCA could be invoked to presume service of notice.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_37\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">23. We then turn to the case of C.C. Alavi Hazi. In para 18 of <a href=\"/doc/844480/\" id=\"a_72\">the said\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">Crl.Rev.P. No. 296/2009                                     Page 14 of 21</span>\n judgment</a>, the facts are narrated. There the complainant issued a lawyer‟s\n\nnotice which was returned with the endorsement that the accused was out\n\nof station. Therefore, that was again a case where the notice was returned\n\nwith some endorsement or remark. It is plain from the above decisions\n\nthat there has to be some feedback in the form of a postal endorsement\n\nthat the notice was refused or not taken delivery of or that the noticee has\n\nleft. Further, in such cases, it will be for the Court to draw an inference\n\nthat service must be presumed. This is not an automatic conclusion to be\n\ndrawn but an assessment to be made by the court keeping in view the the\n\nfacts of the case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_39\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_40\">24. At this juncture, this Court would also like to emphasize that even\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1428703/\" id=\"a_73\">Section 27</a> GC Act, the requirement is that the notice must be\n\n&quot;properly&quot; addressed. The word &quot;properly&quot; obviously envisages the\n\nnotice being sent to the correct present address of the noticee.            The\n\ncomplainant will not be able to demonstrate before the Court that it had\n\n&quot;properly&quot; addressed the noticee unless it is able to produce the proof of\n\ndelivery in the form of a postal endorsement or certificate of the courier\n\nagency or an internet generated delivery report or some other proof of\n\ndelivery.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_41\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_42\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"549946\" id=\"span_25\">25. These days it is not difficult for a person sending a notice by\n\nregistered post or by courier or by Speed Post to obtain a certificate of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">Crl.Rev.P. No. 296/2009                                     Page 15 of 21</span>\n delivery from the postal department or the courier service agency. That\n\ncertificate will indicate the status of the delivery: whether the noticee did\n\nreceive the notice, or refused or that the noticee has left the address, or is\n\nnot available. It would be for the Court to be satisfied whether this would\n\namount to service of notice. It must be remembered that it is to the same\n\naddress that the Court‟s summons will be sent. After the decision in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/549946/\" id=\"a_74\">Adalat Prasad v. Rooplal Jindal</a> (2004) 7 SCC 338, the summoning\n\norder cannot be recalled any more by the learned MM once summons are\n\nsent to the address of the respondent as shown in the complaint which\n\nwould correspond to the to address which the legal notice was sent. If the\n\nsummons is returned with the remarks `left‟ or that `address not known‟\n\nthat then it is impossible for the summons ever to be served on the\n\naccused thereafter. It is also not possible to draw a presumption of\n\nservice at that stage since <a href=\"/doc/24813438/\" id=\"a_75\">Section 144</a> NI Act does not permit such a\n\npresumption to be drawn in the absence of a signed acknowledgment due\n\ncard or a postal endorsement on the returned cover or a proof of delivery\n\ncertificate. The result is that a meaningless exercise of summons having\n\nto be sent to the same address knowing fully well that the accused is not\n\navailable there, has to be undertaken. It is a disseminated fact verifiable\n\nfrom the records that in the courts of the learned MMs in Delhi there are\n\nover 2 lakh such complaints pending without any progress being made\n\nsince summons are unable to be served upon the accused. If it was the\n\nobject of the legislature, in introducing the penal provisions in the <a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_76\">NI Act</a>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">Crl.Rev.P. No. 296/2009                                       Page 16 of 21</span>\n that they should serve as a deterrent to unscrupulous drawers of cheques,\n\nthen the said object is not achieved by the non-service of such summons\n\nresulting in the complaints remaining pending for several years.</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_43\">26. What is happening is that without the complainant being put to any\n\ntrouble in finding out the correct address of the complainant, the burden\n\nis shifted to the court. Our Magistrates are stuck with several such\n\ncomplaints which they are unable to dismiss and are yet unable to\n\nproceed with because the accused has not been served. This was perhaps\n\nnot the intention of the legislature when it introduced penal provisions\n\ninto the <a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_77\">NI Act</a>. While on the one hand a penal statute should be strictly\n\nconstrued, at the same time the construction to be placed on the statue,\n\nand in particular <a href=\"/doc/1240817/\" id=\"a_78\">Section 138 (b)</a> and (c) should be that which advances\n\nthe cause of justice keeping in view the object of the provision. The\n\nconstruction that commends itself to be adopted is that the Court must at\n\nthe pre-summoning stage insist on the complainant showing to it some\n\nproof of delivery of notice in the form of the returned cover with the\n\nendorsement, or an internet generated delivery report or a delivery\n\ncertificate stating inter alia that the drawer refused or has left or is not\n\navailable. Anything short of this it would be unsafe for the Court to\n\naccept and proceed on a presumption of deemed service in terms of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1428703/\" id=\"a_79\">Section 27</a> GC Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_44\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">Crl.Rev.P.

It is one thing to say that sending of a notice is one\n       of the ingredients for maintaining the complaint but it is\n       another thing to say that dishonour of a cheque by itself\n       constitutes an offence. For the purpose of proving its case\n       that the accused had committed an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_81\">Section\n       138</a> of the Negotiable Instruments Act, the ingredients\n       thereof are required to be proved. What would constitute\n       an offence is stated in the main provision. The proviso\n       appended thereto, however, imposes certain further\n       conditions which are required to be fulfilled before\n       cognizance of the offence can be taken.

As it is only on receipt of the\n       notice the accused at his own peril may refuse to pay the\n       amount. Clauses (b) and (c) of the proviso to <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_84\">Section 138</a>\n       therefore must be read together.
