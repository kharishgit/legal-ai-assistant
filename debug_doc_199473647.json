Kapur</a> (supra). While dealing\n\nwith the inherent powers of the High Court under Section 561-A of the\n\nearlier Code (which is pari materia with <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_95\">Section 482</a> of the Code), it is\n\nobserved and held that the inherent powers of the High Court under\n\nSection 561 of the earlier Code cannot be exercised in regard to the\n\nmatters specifically covered by the other provisions of the Code; the\n\ninherent jurisdiction of the High Court can be exercised to quash\n\nproceedings in a proper case either to prevent the abuse of the process\n\nof any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice; ordinarily criminal\n\nproceedings instituted against an accused person must be tried under\n\nthe provisions of the Code, and the High Court would be reluctant to\n\ninterfere with the said proceedings at an interlocutory stage.                    After\n\nobserving this, thereafter this Court then carved out some exceptions to\n\nthe above-stated rule, which are as under:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">             “(i) Where it manifestly appears that there is a legal bar against\n      the institution or continuance of the criminal proceeding in respect of\n      the offence alleged.

In dealing with this class of cases it\n      is important to bear in mind the distinction between a case where there\n      is no legal evidence or where there is evidence which is manifestly and\n      clearly inconsistent with the accusation made and cases where there is\n      legal evidence which on its appreciation may or may not support the\n      accusation in question.

Exercise of power under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_110\">Section 482</a> of the Code in a case\n      of this nature is the exception and not the rule. The section does not\n      confer any new powers on the High Court. It only saves the inherent\n      power which the Court possessed before the enactment of the Code. It\n      envisages three circumstances under which the inherent jurisdiction\n      may be exercised, namely: (i) to give effect to an order under the Code,\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">      (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of court, and (iii) to otherwise\n      secure the ends of justice. It is neither possible nor desirable to lay\n      down any inflexible rule which would govern the exercise of inherent\n      jurisdiction. No legislative enactment dealing with procedure can\n      provide for all cases that may possibly arise. Courts, therefore, have\n      inherent powers apart from express provisions of law which are\n      necessary for proper discharge of functions and duties imposed upon\n      them by law. That is the doctrine which finds expression in the section\n      which merely recognises and preserves inherent powers of the High\n      Courts. All courts, whether civil or criminal, possess in the absence of\n      any express provision, as inherent in their constitution, all such powers\n      as are necessary to do the right and to undo a wrong in course of\n      administration of justice on the principle quando lex aliquid alique\n      concedit, conceditur et id sine quo res ipsa esse non potest (when the\n      law gives a person anything, it gives him that without which it cannot\n      exist). While exercising powers under the section, the Court does not\n      function as a court of appeal or revision. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1033637\" id=\"span_62\">Inherent jurisdiction under the\n      section though wide has to be exercised sparingly, carefully and with\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">                                                                                   22</span>\n\fcaution and only when such exercise is justified by the tests specifically\n<a href=\"/doc/1033637/\" id=\"a_111\">laid down in</a> the section itself. It is to be exercised ex debito justitiae to\ndo real and substantial justice for the administration of which alone\ncourts exist. Authority of the court exists for advancement of justice and\nif any attempt is made to abuse that authority so as to produce\ninjustice, the court has power to prevent such abuse. It would be an\nabuse of the process of the court to allow any action which would result\nin injustice and prevent promotion of justice. In exercise of the powers\ncourt would be justified to quash any proceeding if it finds that initiation\nor continuance of it amounts to abuse of the process of court or\nquashing of these proceedings would otherwise serve the ends of\njustice. When no offence is disclosed by the complaint, the court may\nexamine the question of fact. When a complaint is sought to be\nquashed, it is permissible to look into the materials to assess what the\ncomplainant has alleged and whether any offence is made out even if\nthe allegations are accepted in toto.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_28\">       7. In dealing with the last category, it is important to bear in mind\nthe distinction between a case where there is no legal evidence or\nwhere there is evidence which is clearly inconsistent with the\naccusations made, and a case where there is legal evidence which, on\nappreciation, may or may not support the accusations. When\nexercising jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_112\">Section 482</a> of the Code, the High Court\nwould not ordinarily embark upon an enquiry whether the evidence in\nquestion is reliable or not or whether on a reasonable appreciation of it\naccusation would not be sustained. That is the function of the trial\nJudge. Judicial process, no doubt should not be an instrument of\noppression, or, needless harassment. Court should be circumspect and\njudicious in exercising discretion and should take all relevant facts and\ncircumstances into consideration before issuing process, lest it would\nbe an instrument in the hands of a private complainant to unleash\nvendetta to harass any person needlessly. At the same time the section\nis not an instrument handed over to an accused to short-circuit a\nprosecution and bring about its sudden death…..\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">       8.

The people and the society have a legitimate\n      expectation that those committing offences either against an individual\n      or the society are expeditiously brought to trial and, if found guilty,\n      adequately punished. Therefore, while deciding a petition filed for\n      quashing FIR or complaint or restraining the competent authority from\n      investigating the allegations contained in FIR or complaint or for stalling\n      the trial of the case, the High Court should be extremely careful and\n      circumspect. If the allegations contained in FIR or complaint disclose\n      commission of some crime, then the High Court must keep its hands\n      off and allow the investigating agency to complete the investigation\n      without any fetter and also refrain from passing order which may\n      impede the trial. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"354079\" id=\"span_71\">The High Court should not go into the merits and\n      demerits of the allegations simply because the petitioner alleges malus\n      animus against the author of FIR or the complainant. The High Court\n      must also refrain from making imaginary journey in the realm of\n      possible harassment which may be caused to the petitioner on account\n      of investigation of FIR or complaint. Such a course will result in\n      miscarriage of justice and would encourage those accused of\n      committing crimes to repeat the same. However, if the High Court is\n      satisfied that the complaint does not disclose commission of any\n      offence or prosecution is barred by limitation or that the proceedings of\n      criminal case would result in failure of justice, then it may exercise\n      inherent power under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_122\">Section 482</a> CrPC.”\n\n\n\n7.7   In the case of <a href=\"/doc/354079/\" id=\"a_123\">Arun Gulab Gawali</a> (supra), this Court set aside the\n\norder passed by the High Court quashing the criminal complaint/FIR\n\nwhich was even filed by the complainant.

There is a clear-cut and well demarcated sphere of activity\n     in the field of crime detection and crime punishment. Investigation of an\n     offence is the field exclusively reserved for the executive through the\n     police department the superintendence over which vests in the State\n     Government. The executive which is charged with a duty to keep\n     vigilance over law and order situation is obliged to prevent crime and if\n     an offence is alleged to have been committed it is its bounded duty to\n     investigate into the offence and bring the offender to book. Once it\n     investigates and finds an offence having been committed it is its duty to\n     collect evidence for the purpose of proving the offence. Once that is\n     completed and the investigating officer submits report to the court\n     requesting the court to take cognizance of the offence under <a href=\"/doc/686759/\" id=\"a_142\">Section\n     190</a> of the Code its duty comes to an end. On a cognizance of the\n     offence being taken by the court the police function of investigation\n     comes to an end subject to the provision contained in <a href=\"/doc/274924/\" id=\"a_143\">Section 173(8)</a>,\n     there commences the adjudicatory function of the judiciary to\n     determine whether an offence has been committed and if so, whether\n     by the person or persons charged with the crime by the police in its\n     report to the court, and to award adequate punishment according to\n     law for the offence proved to the satisfaction of the court. There is thus\n     a well defined and well demarcated function in the field of crime\n     detection and its subsequent adjudication between the police and the\n     Magistrate.

The appreciation of\nthe evidence is the function of the courts when seized of the matter. At\nthe stage of investigation, the material collected by an investigating\nofficer cannot be judicially scrutinized for arriving at a conclusion that\nthe police station officer of a particular police station would not have\nterritorial jurisdiction. In any case, it has to be stated that in view of\n<a href=\"/doc/475594/\" id=\"a_158\">Section 178(c)</a> of the Criminal Procedure Code, when it is uncertain in\nwhich of the several local areas an offence was committed, or where it\nconsists of several acts done in different local areas, the said offence\ncan be enquired into or tried by a court having jurisdiction over any of\nsuch local areas. Therefore, to say at the stage of investigation that the\nSHO, Police Station Paschim Vihar, New Delhi was not having\nterritorial jurisdiction, is on the face of it, illegal and erroneous. That\napart, <a href=\"/doc/1252798/\" id=\"a_159\">Section 156(2)</a> contains an embargo that no proceeding of a\npolice officer shall be challenged on the ground that he has no\nterritorial power to investigate.

It may not be out of place to highlight that access to justice\n      must not be understood in a purely quantitative dimension. Access to\n      justice in an egalitarian democracy must be understood to mean\n      qualitative access to justice as well. Access to justice is, therefore,\n      much more than improving an individual&#x27;s access to courts, or\n      guaranteeing representation. It must be defined in terms of ensuring\n      that legal and judicial outcomes are just and equitable [see United\n      Nations Development Programme, Access to Justice — Practice Note\n      (2004)].\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_54\">             27.

However, the\n\nHigh Court should be slow in interfering the criminal proceedings at the\n\ninitial stage, i.e., quashing petition filed immediately after lodging the\n\nFIR/complaint and no sufficient time is given to the police to investigate\n\ninto the allegations of the FIR/complaint, which is the statutory right/duty\n\nof the police under the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_203\">Code of Criminal Procedure</a>.\n\nThere is no denial of the fact that power under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_204\">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. is\n\nvery wide, but as observed by this Court in catena of decisions, referred\n\nto hereinabove, conferment of wide power requires the court to be more\n\ncautious and it casts an onerous and more diligent duty on the court.\n\nTherefore, in exceptional cases, when the High Court deems it fit, regard\n\nbeing had to the parameters of quashing and the self-restraint imposed\n\nby law, may pass appropriate interim orders, as thought apposite in law,\n\nhowever, the High Court has to give brief reasons which will reflect the\n\napplication of mind by the court to the relevant facts.\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_120\">                                                                         45</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_49\">\f16.   We have come across many orders passed by the High Courts\n\npassing interim orders of stay of arrest and/or “no coercive steps to be\n\ntaken against the accused” in the quashing proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_205\">Section\n\n482</a> Cr.P.C. and/or <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_206\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India with assigning\n\nany reasons. We have also come across number of orders passed by\n\nthe High Courts, while dismissing the quashing petitions, of not to arrest\n\nthe accused during the investigation or till the chargesheet/final report\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1412034/\" id=\"a_207\">Section 173</a> Cr.P.C is filed. As observed hereinabove, it is the\n\nstatutory right and even the duty of the police to investigate into the\n\ncognizable offence and collect the evidence during the course of\n\ninvestigation. There may be requirement of a custodial investigation for\n\nwhich the accused is required to be in police custody (popularly known\n\nas remand).    Therefore, passing such type of blanket interim orders\n\nwithout assigning reasons, of not to arrest and/or “no coercive steps”\n\nwould hamper the investigation and may affect the statutory right/duty of\n\nthe police to investigate the cognizable offence conferred under the\n\nprovisions of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_208\">Cr.P.C</a>. Therefore, such a blanket order is not justified\n\nat all. The order of the High Court must disclose reasons why it has\n\npassed an ad-interim direction during the pendency of the proceedings\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_209\">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. Such reasons, however brief must disclose\n\nan application of mind.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_50\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_121\">                                                                       46</span>\n\f     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"24458802\" id=\"span_122\">The aforesaid is required to be considered from another angle\n\nalso. Granting of such blanket order would not only adversely affect the\n\ninvestigation but would have far reaching implications for maintaining the\n\nRule of Law. Where the investigation is stayed for a long time, even if\n\nthe stay is ultimately vacated, the subsequent investigation may not be\n\nvery fruitful for the simple reason that the evidence may no longer be\n\navailable. Therefore, in case, the accused named in the FIR/complaint\n\napprehends his arrest, he has a remedy to apply for anticipatory bail\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1783708/\" id=\"a_210\">Section 438</a> Cr.P.C. and on the conditions of grant of anticipatory\n\nbail under <a href=\"/doc/1783708/\" id=\"a_211\">Section 438</a> Cr.P.C being satisfied, he may be released on\n\nanticipatory bail by the competent court. Therefore, it cannot be said\n\nthat the accused is remediless. It cannot be disputed that the\n\nanticipatory bail under <a href=\"/doc/1783708/\" id=\"a_212\">Section 438</a> Cr.P.C. can be granted on the\n\nconditions prescribed under <a href=\"/doc/1783708/\" id=\"a_213\">Section 438</a> Cr.P.C. are satisfied. At the\n\nsame time, it is to be noted that arrest is not a must whenever an FIR of\n\na cognizable offence is lodged. Still in case a person is apprehending\n\nhis arrest in connection with an FIR disclosing cognizable offence, as\n\nobserved hereinabove, he has a remedy to apply for anticipatory bail\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1783708/\" id=\"a_214\">Section 438</a> Cr.P.C. As observed by this Court in the case of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/24458802/\" id=\"a_215\">Hema Mishra v. State of Uttar Pradesh</a>, (2014) 4 SCC 453, though the\n\nHigh Courts have very wide powers under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_216\">Article 226</a>, the powers under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_217\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India are to be exercised to prevent\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_123\">                                                                       47</span>\n\fmiscarriage of justice and to prevent abuse of process of law by the\n\nauthorities indiscriminately making pre-arrest of the accused persons. It\n\nis further observed that in entertaining such a petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_218\">Article 226</a>,\n\nthe High Court is supposed to balance the two interests. On the one\n\nhand, the Court is to ensure that such a power under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_219\">Article 226</a> is not to\n\nbe exercised liberally so as to convert it into <a href=\"/doc/1783708/\" id=\"a_220\">Section 438</a> Cr.P.C.\n\nproceedings. It is further observed that on the other hand whenever the\n\nHigh Court finds that in a given case if the protection against pre-arrest\n\nis not given, it would amount to gross miscarriage of justice and no case,\n\nat all, is made for arrest pending trial, the High Court would be free to\n\ngrant the relief in the nature of anticipatory bail in exercise of its powers\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_221\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India, keeping in mind that this\n\npower has to be exercised sparingly in those cases where it is absolutely\n\nwarranted and justified. However, such a blanket interim order of not to\n\narrest or “no coercive steps” cannot be passed mechanically and in a\n\nroutine manner.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_51\">17.   So far as the order of not to arrest and/or “no coercive steps” till\n\nthe final report/chargesheet is filed and/or during the course of\n\ninvestigation or not to arrest till the investigation is completed, passed\n\nwhile dismissing the quashing petitions under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_222\">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. and/or\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_223\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India and having opined that no\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_124\">                                                                          48</span>\n\fcase is made out to quash the FIR/complaint is concerned, the same is\n\nwholly impermissible.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_52\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"143800718\" id=\"span_125\">18.   This Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/143800718/\" id=\"a_224\">Habib Abdullah Jeelani</a> (supra), as such,\n\ndeprecated such practice/orders passed by the High Courts, directing\n\npolice not to arrest, even while declining to interfere with the quashing\n\npetition in exercise of powers under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_225\">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. In the aforesaid\n\ncase before this Court, the High Court dismissed the petition filed under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_226\">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. for quashing the FIR. However, while dismissing the\n\nquashing petition, the High Court directed the police not to arrest the\n\npetitioners during the pendency of the investigation. While setting aside\n\nsuch order, it is observed by this Court that such direction amounts to an\n\norder under <a href=\"/doc/1783708/\" id=\"a_227\">Section 438</a> Cr.P.C., albeit without satisfaction of the\n\nconditions of the said provision and the same is legally unacceptable. In\n\nthe aforesaid decision, it is specifically observed and held by this Court\n\nthat “it is absolutely inconceivable and unthinkable to pass an order\n\ndirecting the police not to arrest till the investigation is completed while\n\ndeclining to interfere or expressing opinion that it is not appropriate to\n\nstay the investigation”. It is further observed that this kind of order is\n\nreally inappropriate and unseemly and it has no sanction in law. It is\n\nfurther observed that the courts should oust and obstruct unscrupulous\n\nlitigants from invoking the inherent jurisdiction of the Court on the drop of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_126\">                                                                          49</span>\n\fa hat to file an application for quashing of launching an FIR or\n\ninvestigation and then seek relief by an interim order.                 It is further\n\nobserved that it is the obligation of the court to keep such unprincipled\n\nand unethical litigants at bay.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\">      In the aforesaid decision, this Court has further deprecated the\n\norders passed by the High Courts, while dismissing the applications\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_228\">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. to the effect that if the petitioner-accused\n\nsurrenders before the trial Magistrate, he shall be admitted to bail on\n\nsuch terms and conditions as deemed fit and appropriate to be imposed\n\nby the Magistrate concerned. It is observed that such orders are de\n\nhors the powers conferred under <a href=\"/doc/1783708/\" id=\"a_229\">Section 438</a> Cr.P.C. That thereafter,\n\nthis Court in paragraph 25 has observed as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_55\">       “25. Having reminded the same, presently we can only say that the\n       types of orders like the present one, are totally unsustainable, for it is\n       contrary to the aforesaid settled principles and judicial precedents. It is\n       intellectual truancy to avoid the precedents and issue directions which\n       are not in consonance with law. It is the duty of a Judge to sustain the\n       judicial balance and not to think of an order which can cause trauma to\n       the process of adjudication. It should be borne in mid that the culture of\n       adjudication is stabilised when intellectual discipline is maintained and\n       further when such discipline constantly keeps guard on the mind.”\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_54\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"143800718\" id=\"span_127\">19.

This is\n  important for sustaining the litigants&#x27; faith in the justice delivery system.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_70\">      (j) Insistence on reason is a requirement for both judicial accountability\n  and transparency.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_71\">      (k) If a judge or a quasi-judicial authority is not candid enough about\n  his/her decision-making process then it is impossible to know whether the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_141\">                                                                                   55</span>\n\f  person deciding is faithful to the doctrine of precedent or to principles of\n  incrementalism.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_72\">      (l) Reasons in support of decisions must be cogent, clear and succinct.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_63\">  A pretence of reasons or “rubber-stamp reasons” is not to be equated with\n  a valid decision-making process.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_64\">      (m) It cannot be doubted that transparency is the sine qua non of\n  restraint on abuse of judicial powers. Transparency in decision-making not\n  only makes the judges and decision-makers less prone to errors but also\n  makes them subject to broader scrutiny. (See David Shapiro in Defence of\n  Judicial Candor [(1987) 100 Harvard Law Review 731-37] .)\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_65\">      (n) Since the requirement to record reasons emanates from the broad\n  doctrine of fairness in decision-making, the said requirement is now\n  virtually a component of human rights and was considered part of\n  Strasbourg Jurisprudence. See Ruiz Torija v. Spain [(1994) 19 EHRR 553]\n  EHRR, at 562 para 29 and Anya v. University of Oxford [2001 EWCA Civ\n  405 (CA)] , wherein the Court referred to <a href=\"/doc/19636/\" id=\"a_255\">Article 6</a> of the European\n  Convention of Human Rights which requires,\n  “adequate and intelligent reasons must be given for judicial decisions”.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_66\">      (o) In all common law jurisdictions judgments play a vital role in setting\n  up precedents for the future. Therefore, for development of law,\n  requirement of giving reasons for the decision is of the essence and is\n  virtually a part of “due process”.”\n\n\n     Therefore, even while passing such an interim order, in exceptional\n\ncases with caution and circumspection, the High Court has to give brief\n\nreasons why it is necessary to pass such an interim order, more\n\nparticularly when the High Court is exercising the extraordinary and\n\ninherent powers under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_256\">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. and/or under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_257\">Article 226</a> of\n\nthe Constitution of India. Therefore, in the facts and circumstances of\n\nthe case, the High Court has committed a grave error of law and also of\n\nfacts in passing such an interim order of “no coercive steps to be\n\nadopted” and the same deserves to be quashed and set aside.\n\nCriminal Miscellaneous Petition No. 4961 of 2021\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_142\">                                                                                   56</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_67\">\f22.

However, an interim order of stay of\n\ninvestigation during the pendency of the quashing petition can be\n\npassed with circumspection.        Such an interim order should not\n\nrequire to be passed routinely, casually and/or mechanically.\n\nNormally, when the investigation is in progress and the facts are\n\nhazy and the entire evidence/material is not before the High Court,\n\nthe High Court should restrain itself from passing the interim order\n\nof not to arrest or “no coercive steps to be adopted” and the\n\naccused should be relegated to apply for anticipatory bail under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1783708/\" id=\"a_272\">Section 438</a> Cr.P.C. before the competent court.
