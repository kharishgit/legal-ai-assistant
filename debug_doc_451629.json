The drawee bank is at\nMumbai, notice issued by the respondent to the petitioner\ncompany was received at Mumbai and thus merely because\nthe respondent posted the notice from Delhi and deposited\nthe cheque with its bank at Delhi would not confer\njurisdiction on Courts in Delhi.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_9\">9.    The issue has to be debated with reference to <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_12\">Section\n138</a> of the NI Act and the applicable provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_13\">Code\nof Criminal Procedure</a> i.e. <a href=\"/doc/1219882/\" id=\"a_14\">Sections 177</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1220064/\" id=\"a_15\">178</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1693935/\" id=\"a_16\">179</a> of the\nCode of Criminal Procedure.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">10.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"529907\" id=\"span_4\">In the decision reported as 1999 (<a href=\"/doc/529907/\" id=\"a_17\">7) SCC 510\nK.Bhaskaran Vs.

To put it pithily, in relation to territorial\njurisdiction, qua an offence, law recognizes more than 1\ncourt having territorial jurisdiction and the issue of territorial\njurisdiction would have to be decided with reference to\nwhether a part of an offence was committed within the\nterritorial jurisdiction of a court. The issue is no longer res\nintegra and I just need to note the decision of the Supreme\nCourt in K.Bhaskaran‟s case (supra) and highlight that the\naforesaid is to be culled out from paras 11 and 12 of <a href=\"/doc/529907/\" id=\"a_19\">the\nsaid decision</a>.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_11\">11.   The next logical question would be, what are the\ncontours of <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act pertaining to acts to be\nperformed in relation to an offence contemplated by the\nsaid Section? It hardly be re-emphasized that it are acts of\ncommission or omission which constitute offences, with or\nwithout the requisite mens rea, depending upon whether\nthe offence is an absolute offence or not.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_12\">12.   Let me thus note <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 138</a>, NI Act which reads as\nunder:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">      Where any cheque drawn by a person on an\n      account maintained by him with a banker for\n      payment of any amount of money to another\n      person from out of that account for the\n      discharge, in whole or in part, of any debt or\n      other liability, is returned by the bank unpaid,\n      either because of the amount of money standing\n      to the credit of that account is insufficient to\n      honour the cheque or that it exceeds the amount\n      arranged to be paid from that account by an\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">Crl.M.C.No.1056/2011 &amp; connected matters               Page 10 of 27</span>\n       agreement made with that bank, such person\n      shall be deemed to have committed an offence\n      and shall without prejudice to any other\n      provisions of this Act, be punished with\n      imprisonment for a term which may extend to\n      two year, or with fine which may extend to twice\n      the amount of the cheque, or with both:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">      Provided that nothing contained in this section\n      shall apply unless-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">      (a) The cheque has been presented to the bank\n      within a period of six months from the date on\n      which it is drawn or within the period of its\n      validity, whichever is earlier.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">      (b) The payee or the holder induce course of the\n      cheque, as the case may be, makes a demand\n      for the payment of the said amount of money by\n      giving a notice, in writing, to the drawer, of the\n      cheque, within thirty days of the receipt of\n      information by him from the bank regarding the\n      return of the cheques as unpaid, and\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">      (c) The drawer of such cheque fails to make the\n      payment of the said amount of money to the\n      payee or, as the case may be, to the holder in\n      due course of the cheque, within fifteen days of\n      the receipt of the said notice.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_13\">      Explanation: For the purpose of this section,\n      &quot;debt or other liability&quot; means a legally\n      enforceable debt or other liability.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">13.   In Bhaskaran‟s case (supra) the Supreme Court had an\noccasion to deal with the issue of territorial jurisdiction in\nrelation to <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act, and of necessity, the\ndiscussion required the Supreme Court to identify the\nvarious acts of commission and omission which constituted\nthe offence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act and\nsuffice would it be to highlight that in para 14 of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">Crl.M.C.No.1056/2011 &amp; connected matters            Page 11 of 27</span>\n decision, the Supreme Court highlighted that there are 5\nacts which are the components of the offence punishable\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act and I re-produce the same\nfrom para 14 of the decision of the Supreme Court. They\nread as under:-\n</p>\n<pre id=\"pre_2\">(i)     drawing of the cheque,\n(ii)    presentation of the cheque to the bank,\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_15\">(iii)   returning the cheque unpaid by the drawee bank,\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_16\">(iv)    giving notice in writing to the drawer of the cheque\ndemanding payment of the cheque amount,\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_17\">(v)     failure of the drawer to make payment within 15 days\nof the receipt of the notice.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">14.     After   holding     that    5      acts   would   constitute    the\ncomponents of an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act,\nin paras 15 and 16 the Supreme Court observed as under:-\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_19\">        &quot;15. It is not necessary that all the above five\n        acts should have been perpetrated at the same\n        locality. It is possible that each of those five acts\n        could be done at five different localities. But a\n        concatenation of all the above five is a sine qua\n        non for the completion of the offence under\n        <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 138</a> of the Code. In this context a\n        reference to Section 178(d) of the Code is useful.\n        It is extracted below:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">        ....\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_20\">        16. Thus it is clear, if the five different acts were\n        done in five different localities any one of the\n        courts exercising jurisdiction in one of the five\n        local areas can become the place of trial for the\n        offence under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 138</a> of the Act. In other\n        words, the complainant can choose any one of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">Crl.M.C.No.1056/2011 &amp; connected matters                        Page 12 of 27</span>\n       those courts having jurisdiction over any one of\n      the local areas within the territorial limits of\n      which any one of those five acts was done. As\n      the amplitude stands so widened and so\n      expansive it is an idle exercise to raise\n      jurisdictional question regarding the offence\n      under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 138</a> of the Act.&quot; (Emphasis\n      Supplied)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">15.   On the issue of service of notice required to be given\nby the complainant to the accused, the Supreme Court\nobserved as under:-\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">      &quot;17. The more important point to be decided in\n      this case is whether the cause of action has\n      arisen at all as the notice sent by the\n      complainant to the accused was returned as\n      &quot;unclaimed&quot;. The conditions pertaining to the\n      notice to be given to the drawer, have been\n      formulated and incorporated in clauses (b) to (c)\n      of the proviso to <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 138</a> of the Act. The said\n      clauses are extracted below:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">      .....\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">      18. On the part of the payee he has to make a\n      demand by &quot;giving a notice&quot; in writing. If that\n      was the only requirement to complete the\n      offence on the failure of the drawer to pay the\n      cheque amount within 15 days from the date of\n      such &quot;giving&quot;, the travails of the prosecution\n      would have been very much lessened. But the\n      legislature says that failure on the part of the\n      drawer to pay the amount should be within 15\n      days &quot;of the receipt&quot; of the said notice. It is,\n      therefore, clear that &quot;giving notice&quot; in the\n      context is not the same as receipt of notice.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_22\">      Giving is a process of which receipt is the\n      accomplishment. It is for the payee to perform\n      the former process by sending the notice to the\n      drawer at the correct address.\n</p>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">Crl.M.C.No.1056/2011 &amp; connected matters            Page 13 of 27</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\">       .....\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_24\">      20. If a strict interpretation is given that the\n      drawer should have actually received the notice\n      for the period of 15 days to start running no\n      matter that the payee sent the notice on the\n      correct address, a trickster cheque drawer would\n      get the premium to avoid receiving the notice by\n      different strategies and he could escape from the\n      legal consequences of <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 138</a> of the Act. It\n      must be borne in mind that the court should not\n      adopt an interpretation which helps a dishonest\n      evader and clips an honest payee as that would\n      defeat the very legislative measure.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_25\">      21. ....The context envisaged in <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 138</a> of\n      the Act invites a liberal interpretation for the\n      person who has the statutory obligation to give\n      notice because he is presumed to be the loser in\n      the transaction and it is for his interest the very\n      provision is made by the legislature. The words\n      in clause (b) of the proviso to <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 138</a> of the\n      Act show that the payee has the statutory\n      obligation to &quot;make a demand&quot; by giving notice.\n      The thrust in the clause is on the need to &quot;make\n      a demand&quot;. It is only the mode for making such\n      demand which the legislature has prescribed. A\n      payee can send the notice for doing his part for\n      giving the notice. Once it is despatched his part\n      is over and the next depends on what the sendee\n      does.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_26\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"327478\" id=\"span_10\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1821913\" id=\"span_11\">22. It is well settled that a notice refused to be\n      accepted by the addressee can be presumed to\n      have been served on him (vide <a href=\"/doc/1821913/\" id=\"a_33\">Harcharan Singh\n      v.

Here the notice is returned as unclaimed\n      and not as refused. Will there be any significant\n      difference between the two so far as the\n      presumption of service is concerned? In this\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">Crl.M.C.No.1056/2011 &amp; connected matters             Page 14 of 27</span>\n       connection a reference to <a href=\"/doc/1428703/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 27</a> of the\n      General Clauses Act will be useful. The section\n      reads thus:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">      .....\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_28\">      24. No doubt <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 138</a> of the Act does not\n      require that the notice should be given only by\n      &quot;post&quot;. Nonetheless the principle incorporated in\n      <a href=\"/doc/1887096/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 27</a> (quoted above) can profitably be\n      imported in a case where the sender has\n      despatched the notice by post with the correct\n      address written on it. Then it can be deemed to\n      have been served on the sendee unless he\n      proves that it was not really served and that he\n      was not responsible for such non-service. Any\n      other interpretation can lead to a very tenuous\n      position as the drawer of the cheque who is\n      liable to pay the amount would resort to the\n      strategy of subterfuge by successfully avoiding\n      the notice.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_29\">      25. Thus, when a notice is returned by the\n      sendee as unclaimed such date would be the\n      commencing date in reckoning the period of 15\n      days contemplated in clause (c) to the proviso of\n      <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 138</a> of the Act. Of course such reckoning\n      would be without prejudice to the right of the\n      drawer of the cheque to show that he had no\n      knowledge that the notice was brought to his\n      address. In the present case the accused did not\n      even attempt to discharge the burden to rebut\n      the aforesaid presumption.&quot; (Emphasis Supplied)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_30\">16.   The expressions: „presentation of the cheque to the\nBank‟ and „if the five different acts were done in five\ndifferent localities any           one of the courts exercising\njurisdiction in one of the five local areas can become the\nplace of trial for the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 138</a> of the Act‟ to\nbe found in paras 14 and 16 respectively in Bhaskaran‟s\ncase (supra) have been understood by many to mean that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">Crl.M.C.No.1056/2011 &amp; connected matters               Page 15 of 27</span>\n the Court within local limits of which the payee Bank i.e. the\nBank where the complainant deposited the cheque is\nsituated has the jurisdiction to try the complaint under\n<a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act, and the understanding appears to\nbe fortified by the observations of the Supreme Court in\nparas 15 and 16 that if the 5 acts contemplated as the\ningredient of an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act\nwere done in 5 different localities, any one of the court\nexercising jurisdiction in any one of the 5 local areas would\nhave jurisdiction.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\">17.

The third act is the return of the cheque unpaid by the\ndrawee bank and thus there is no scope for any argument\nas to which bank is contemplated with reference to the said\nact.

It determines\n      what particular thing is meant; that is, what\n      particular thing we are to assume to be meant.\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">      &quot;The&quot; is always mentioned to denote a particular\n      thing or a person. &quot;The&quot; would, therefore, refer\n      implicitly to a specified bank and not any bank.\n      &quot;The bank&quot; referred to in clause (a) to the\n      proviso to <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_54\">Section 138</a> of the Act would mean the\n      drawee bank on which the cheque is drawn and\n      not all banks where the cheque is presented for\n      collection including the bank of the payee, in\n      whose favour the cheque is issued.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_41\">      10. It, however, does not mean that the cheque\n      is always to be presented to the drawer&#x27;s bank\n      on which the cheque is issued. The payee of the\n      cheque has the option to present the cheque in\n      any bank including the collecting bank where he\n      has his account but to attract the criminal\n      liability of the drawer of the cheque such\n      collecting bank is obliged to present the cheque\n      in the drawee or payee bank on which the\n      cheque is drawn within the period of six months\n      from the date on which it is shown to have been\n      issued.......The non-presentation of the cheque to\n      the drawee bank within the period specified in\n      the section would absolve the person issuing the\n      cheque of his criminal liability under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 138</a>\n      of the Act, who shall otherwise may be liable to\n      pay the cheque amount to the payee in a civil\n      action initiated under the law.

Such presentation is\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">Crl.M.C.No.1056/2011 &amp; connected matters            Page 19 of 27</span>\n       necessarily to be made within six months at the\n      bank on which the cheque is drawn, whether\n      presented personally or through another bank,\n      namely, the collecting bank of the payee.&quot;\n      (Emphasis Supplied)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\">21.   Though the decision in Ishar Alloy‟s case (supra) has\nbeen rendered in the context of limitation for presentation\nof a cheque<a href=\"/doc/499876/\" id=\"a_59\">, <a href=\"/doc/499876/\" id=\"a_60\">the said decision</a></a> brings out in no uncertain\nterms that <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_61\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act contemplates that a\ncheque is required to be presented for encashment to the\ndrawee Bank and that the payee Bank, merely acts as an\nagent of the payee/complainant for the purposes of\npresenting the cheque in question for encashment to the\ndrawee Bank.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_43\">22.   Thus, the 2nd act to which the Supreme Court referred\nto in Bhaskaran‟s case as one of the 5 which constitutes the\noffence     under     <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_62\">Section     138</a>      of   the   NI   Act   was     the\npresentation of the cheque to the drawee bank and\nneedless to state the 3rd act which constitutes an ingredient\nof the offence is the return of the cheque unpaid by the\ndrawee bank and thus it becomes crystal clear that the 2 nd\nand 3rd act constituting the offence would relate to only one\nplace i.e. the place where the drawee bank is located.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_44\">23.   These are my humble reasons to hold that the\nobservations in paras 15 and 16 have to be read as an\norbiter and thus the 5 acts contemplated as constituting the\noffence are capable of being performed not in 5 but only in\n4 places and since deposit of the cheque with the payee\nbank is not an act contemplated as an ingredient of the\noffence, the place where the payee bank is located would be\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">Crl.M.C.No.1056/2011 &amp; connected matters                         Page 20 of 27</span>\n irrelevant for purposes of determining jurisdiction of the\ncriminal court.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_45\">24.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1001948\" id=\"span_20\">It is settled law that a decision is an authority for the\npoint it decides and not what can be logically deduced\ntherefrom and the ratio of a decision has to be gathered\nwith reference to the facts of a case and I just highlight only\none decision of the Supreme Court being the decision\nreported as <a href=\"/doc/1001948/\" id=\"a_63\">Dhodha House v S.K.

The necessary\ncorollary thereof is that no part of cause of action for the\noffence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_83\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act arises in\nthe Court within the local limits of which the collecting Bank\nof the complainant i.e. payee Bank is situated and thus said\nCourt has no jurisdiction to try a complaint under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_84\">Section\n138</a> of the NI Act filed by the complainant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_49\">28.

I have already noted the observations made by the\nSupreme Court in Bhaskaran‟s case (supra) in the foregoing\nparas and would highlight that in paras 17 to 23 the\nSupreme Court has reflected upon the limitation within\nwhich the notice has to be given to the accused.              The\nSupreme Court was considering the expression „giving a\nnotice‟ in proviso (b) to <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_87\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act, with\nreference to the 15 days‟ time contemplated then by which\nthe requisite notice had to be served, which time is now 30\ndays.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_52\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"463854\" id=\"span_23\">30.     Another decision of the Supreme Court, reported as\n(<a href=\"/doc/463854/\" id=\"a_88\">2009) 1 SCC 720 Harman Electronics Private Limited v\nNational Panasonic India Private Limited</a> is worth noting on\nthe subject.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\">31.     In Harman‟s case (supra) the question which had\narisen before the Supreme Court was precisely the same\nquestion which arises for consideration in the present\npetition i.e. whether the court within the local limits of which\nthe place from where the complainant had sent a notice\ncontemplated under proviso (b) to <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_89\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act\nis situated has the jurisdiction to try a complaint filed under\n<a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_90\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act. Answering the aforesaid question\nin the negative, the Supreme Court observed as under:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">        &quot;12. .....The only question, therefore, which\n        arises for consideration is that as to whether\n        sending of notice from Delhi itself would give rise\n        to a cause of action for taking cognizance under\n        the <a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_91\">Negotiable Instruments Act</a>.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">Crl.M.C.No.1056/2011 &amp; connected matters               Page 23 of 27</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"463854\" id=\"span_25\">13. It is one thing to say that sending of a\n      notice is one of the ingredients for maintaining\n      the complaint but it is another thing to say that\n      dishonour of a cheque by itself constitutes an\n      offence. For the purpose of proving its case that\n      the accused had committed an offence under\n      <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_92\">Section 138</a> of the Negotiable Instruments Act,\n      the ingredients thereof are required to be\n      proved. What would constitute an offence is\n      stated in the main provision. The proviso\n      appended thereto, however, imposes certain\n      further conditions which are required to be\n      fulfilled before cognizance of the offence can be\n      taken. If the ingredients for constitution of the\n      offence <a href=\"/doc/463854/\" id=\"a_93\">laid down in</a> provisos (a), (b) and (c)\n      appended to <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_94\">Section 138</a> of the Negotiable\n      Instruments Act are intended to be applied in\n      favour of the accused, there cannot be any doubt\n      that receipt of a notice would ultimately give rise\n      to the cause of action for filing a complaint. As it\n      is only on receipt of the notice that the accused\n      at his own peril may refuse to pay the amount.\n      Clauses (b) and (c) of the proviso to <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_95\">Section 138</a>\n      therefore must be read together. Issuance of\n      notice would not by itself give rise to a cause of\n      action but communication of the notice would.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">      .......For constitution of an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_96\">Section\n      138</a> of the Act, the notice must be received by\n      the accused. It may be deemed to have been\n      received in certain situations. The word\n      &quot;communicate&quot; inter alia means &quot;to make\n      known, inform, convey, etc&quot;.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_54\">      .....\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_55\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"60864\" id=\"span_26\">20. ..... A court derives a jurisdiction only when\n      the cause of action arose within its jurisdiction.\n      The same cannot be conferred by any act of\n      omission or commission on the part of the\n      accused. A distinction must also be borne in\n      mind between the ingredient of an offence and\n      commission of a part of the offence. While\n      issuance of a notice by the holder of a negotiable\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">Crl.M.C.No.1056/2011 &amp; connected matters              Page 24 of 27</span>\n       instrument is necessary, service thereof is also\n      imperative. Only on a service of such notice and\n      failure on the part of the accused to pay the\n      demanded amount within a period of 15 days\n      thereafter, the commission of an offence\n      completes. Giving of notice, therefore, cannot\n      have any precedent over the service. It is only\n      from that view of the matter that in <a href=\"/doc/60864/\" id=\"a_97\">Dalmia\n      Cement (Bharat) Ltd. v. Galaxy Traders &amp;\n      Agencies Ltd</a> emphasis has been laid on service\n      of notice.&quot; (Emphasis Supplied)</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_56\">32.   At a first blush reading of the decisions of the Supreme\nCourt in Bhaskaran and Harman‟s cases (supra) it may\nstrike to the reader that there is a conflict between the two\ndecisions inasmuch as in Bhaskaran‟s case (supra) it was\nheld that the expression „giving of notice‟ occurring in\nproviso (b) to <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_98\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act means „sending of\nnotice‟ whereas in Harman‟s case (supra) it was held that\nthe said expression means „receipt of notice‟.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_57\">33.   A careful reading of the two decisions shows that there\nis no conflict between the said decisions inasmuch as they\nhave been rendered in different contexts. The decision in\nBhaskaran‟s case (supra) was rendered in the context of\nstarting point of limitation period of 15 days prescribed in\nproviso (b) to <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_99\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act and it was in that\ncontext i.e. the context of limitation that it was held by the\nSupreme Court that the expression giving of notice‟\noccurring in proviso (b) to <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_100\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act means\n„sending of notice‟. The decision in Harman‟s case (supra)\nwas rendered in the context of cause of action for filing a\ncomplaint under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_101\">Section 138</a> NI Act within jurisdiction of a\nparticular court and in that context it was held by the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">Crl.M.C.No.1056/2011 &amp; connected matters            Page 25 of 27</span>\n Supreme Court that the expression giving of notice‟\noccurring in proviso (b) to <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_102\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act means\n„receipt of notice‟.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_58\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"10099\" id=\"span_29\">34.    Now, same expression can have different meanings in\ndifferent context as held by the Supreme Court in the\ndecision reported as <a href=\"/doc/10099/\" id=\"a_103\">Malik Lal Majumdar v Gouranga\nChandra Dey</a> (2004) 12 SCC 448 wherein it was observed\nthat a word occurring in a statutory provision can have\ndifferent meanings in different context within the same\nstatute.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_59\">35.    Thus, the inevitable conclusion would be that the 4 th\nact contemplated as an ingredient of the offence as\nhighlighted in Bhaskaran‟s case i.e. „giving notice in writing\nto the drawer of cheque‟ demanding payment of the cheque\namount, for purposes of limitation would have a meaning as\nexplained      in   Bhaskaran‟s        case     and    for   purposes      of\njurisdiction would have a meaning as explained in Ishar\nAlloy‟s case (supra).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_60\">36.    Before concluding I would be failing not to lodge a\ncaveat. With electronic banking and facility payable at par\nof    clearance     provided      by       bankers    and    especially    in\nmetropolitan cities, where cheques are cleared by not being\npresented to the drawee bank but at nodal branches of the\nconcerned banks, the subject matter of jurisdiction may\nhave to be decided keeping in view that the drawee bank\nhas created an agency where the cheque in question is\ntransmitted for clearance and the situs where the clearance\ntakes place would then arguably become the place where\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">Crl.M.C.No.1056/2011 &amp; connected matters                         Page 26 of 27</span>\n the cheque would be required to be treated as presented to\n„the bank‟ i.e. the drawee bank. But, in such circumstances,\nproperly constituted pleadings have to be found in a\ncomplaint and lodging the caveat, I leave it at that for the\ndebate to be properly argued in an appropriate case with\nthe necessary relevant pleadings.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_61\">37.   I hold that on the pleadings in the complaint(s), no\npart of cause of action can be said to have accrued to the\ncomplainant at Delhi; that the notice demanding payment\nwas posted from Delhi and that the cheque was deposited\nwith the payee bank at Delhi would not constitute the acts\ncontemplated as ingredients of an offence punishable under\n<a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_104\">Section 138</a> NI Act and thus I dispose of the petitions\nquashing the impugned order(s) dated 14.2.2011 and direct\nthe learned ACMM to return the complaint(s) to the\nrespondents       for    filing    in      a    Court   having   territorial\njurisdiction.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_62\">38.
