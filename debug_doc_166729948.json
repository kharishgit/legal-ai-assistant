On the other hand, ACL filed a special leave petition 19 against the\n\njudgment of the High Court allowing the proceedings under the first complaint to\n\ncontinue. Both the special leave petitions were tagged and heard together.\n\n\n18      The Single Judge, while allowing the petition under Section 482 and quashing\n\nthe proceedings in the second complaint has provided the following reasons:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">                 “19.

Though part of\n                 compromise deed executed by the parties, the complaint\n                 initiated on the cheques issued on the deed of compromise\n                 cannot be sustained. Since originally the petitioners issued\n                 the first set of cheques on their liability of payment towards\n                 the three HSS Agreements is still pending as per the\n                 proceedings under the <a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_27\">Negotiable Instruments Act</a>. Therefore\n                 the second set of cheques issued only on the basis of deed of\n                 compromise and those are not issued for any liability.

The High Court\n\nhas also held that since the validity of the deed of compromise is challenged in the\n\nsuit pending before the High Court, the cheques issued on the basis of the deed of\n\ncompromise cannot be construed towards the discharge of liability. In this batch of\n\ntwo appeals, the appeal by Gimpex Private Limited (appellant) assails the decision\n\nof the High Court to quash the second complaint under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 138</a> on the ground\n\nthat the cheques which were issued in pursuance of the deed of compromise could\n\nnot be construed to be in discharge of a liability.

However, the intent of the legislature in providing a criminal\n\nsanction for dishonour of cheques is to ensure the credibility of transactions\n\ninvolving negotiable instruments. The Court observed:</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">                  “4. It may be noted that when the offence was inserted in the\n                  statute in 1988, it carried the provision for imprisonment up to\n                  one year, which was revised to two years following the\n                  amendment to the Act in 2002. It is quite evident that the\n                  legislative intent was to provide a strong criminal remedy in\n                  order to deter the worryingly high incidence of dishonour of\n                  cheques. While the possibility of imprisonment up to two\n                  years provides a remedy of a punitive nature, the provision for\n                  imposing a “fine which may extend to twice the amount of the\n                  cheque” serves a compensatory purpose. What must be\n                  remembered is that the dishonour of a cheque can be best\n                  described as a regulatory offence that has been created to\n                  serve the public interest in ensuring the reliability of these\n                  instruments. The impact of this offence is usually confined to\n                  the private parties involved in commercial transactions.”\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">23</span>\n     (2021) SCC Online SC 485\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">24</span>\n     (2010) 5 SCC 663\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">                                                    19</span>\n\f                                                                                 PART C\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_65\">30    However, this Court also noted that the introduction of a criminal remedy has\n\ngiven rise to a worrying trend where cases under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_60\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act are\n\ndisproportionately burdening the criminal justice system. This Court observed:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">             “5. Invariably, the provision of a strong criminal remedy has\n             encouraged the institution of a large number of cases that are\n             relatable to the offence contemplated by <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_61\">Section 138</a> of the\n             Act. So much so, that at present a disproportionately large\n             number of cases involving the dishonour of cheques is\n             choking our criminal justice system, especially at the level of\n             Magistrates’ Courts. As per the 213th Report of the Law\n             Commission of India, more than 38 lakh cheque bouncing\n             cases were pending before various courts in the country as of\n             October 2008. This is putting an unprecedented strain on our\n             judicial system.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_66\">31    Thus, under the shadow of <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_62\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act, parties are encouraged\n\nto settle the dispute resulting in ultimate closure of the case rather than continuing\n\nwith a protracted litigation before the court. This is beneficial for the complainant as\n\nit results in early recovery of money; alteration of the terms of the contract for higher\n\ncompensation and avoidance of litigation. Equally, the accused is benefitted as it\n\nleads to avoidance of a conviction and sentence or payment of a fine. It also leads to\n\nunburdening of the judicial system, which has a huge pendency of complaints filed\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_63\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1594211\" id=\"span_62\">In <a href=\"/doc/1594211/\" id=\"a_64\">Damodar S. Prabhu</a> (supra) this Court had\n\nemphasised that the compensatory aspect of the remedy under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_65\">Section 138</a> of the\n\nNI Act must be preferred and has encouraged litigants to resolve disputes amicably.\n\nThe Court observed:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">             “18. It is quite obvious that with respect to the offence of\n             dishonour of cheques, it is the compensatory aspect of the\n             remedy which should be given priority over the punitive\n             aspect. There is also some support for the apprehensions\n             raised by the learned Attorney General that a majority of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">                                               20</span>\n\f                                                                   PART C\n\ncheque bounce cases are indeed being compromised or\nsettled by way of compounding, albeit during the later stages\nof litigation thereby contributing to undue delay in justice\ndelivery. The problem herein is with the tendency of litigants\nto belatedly choose compounding as a means to resolve their\ndispute. Furthermore, the written submissions filed on behalf\nof the learned Attorney General have stressed on the fact that\nunlike <a href=\"/doc/91933/\" id=\"a_66\">Section 320</a> CrPC, <a href=\"/doc/177946336/\" id=\"a_67\">Section 147</a> of the Negotiable\nInstruments Act provides no explicit guidance as to what\nstage compounding can or cannot be done and whether\ncompounding can be done at the instance of the complainant\nor with the leave of the court.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">19. As mentioned earlier, the learned Attorney General’s\nsubmission is that in the absence of statutory guidance,\nparties are choosing compounding as a method of last resort\ninstead of opting for it as soon as the Magistrates take\ncognizance of the complaints. One explanation for such\nbehaviour could be that the accused persons are willing to\ntake the chance of progressing through the various stages of\nlitigation and then choose the route of settlement only when\nno other route remains. While such behaviour may be viewed\nas rational from the viewpoint of litigants, the hard facts are\nthat the undue delay in opting for compounding contributes to\nthe arrears pending before the courts at various levels. If the\naccused is willing to settle or compromise by way of\ncompounding of the offence at a later stage of litigation, it is\ngenerally indicative of some merit in the complainant’s case.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_67\">In such cases it would be desirable if parties choose\ncompounding during the earlier stages of litigation. If\nhowever, the accused has a valid defence such as a mistake,\nforgery or coercion among other grounds, then the matter can\nbe litigated through the specified forums.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_68\">[…]\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_69\">23. We are also in agreement with the learned Attorney\nGeneral’s suggestions for controlling the filing of multiple\ncomplaints that are relatable to the same transaction. It was\nsubmitted that complaints are being increasingly filed in\nmultiple jurisdictions in a vexatious manner which causes\ntremendous harassment and prejudice to the drawers of the\ncheque. For instance, in the same transaction pertaining to a\nloan taken on an instalment basis to be repaid in equated\nmonthly instalments, several cheques are taken which are\ndated for each monthly instalment and upon the dishonour of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_64\">                                  21</span>\n\f                                                                                                   PART C\n\n                each of such cheques, different complaints are being filed in\n                different courts which may also have jurisdiction in relation to\n                the complaint. In light of this submission, we direct that it\n                should be mandatory for the complainant to disclose that no\n                other complaint has been filed in any other court in respect of\n                the same transaction. Such a disclosure should be made on a\n                sworn affidavit which should accompany the complaint filed\n                under <a href=\"/doc/444619/\" id=\"a_68\">Section 200</a> CrPC. If it is found that such multiple\n                complaints have been filed, orders for transfer of the\n                complaint to the first court should be given, generally\n                speaking, by the High Court after imposing heavy costs on\n                the complainant for resorting to such a practice.

The\n                reasons for the backlog of cases, according to the learned\n                Amici Curiae, is that while there is a steady increase in the\n                institution of complaints every year, the rate of disposal does\n                not match the rate of institution of complaints.

The dishonour of the cheques on 21 August 2012 on the\n\nground that the payment had been stopped by the drawer or, as the case may be,\n\nfor insufficiency of funds led to the issuance of legal notices under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_81\">Section 138</a> of\n\nthe NI Act and the institution of the first criminal complaint before the Seventh\n\nMetropolitan Magistrate.

While the suit is pending, the interim application stands\n\ndismissed. In this backdrop, there are two sets of criminal complaints under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_85\">Section\n\n138</a> of the NI Act based on the dishonour of the first set of cheques and the second\n\nset respectively.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_75\">\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"635335\" id=\"span_70\">37        Allowing prosecution under both sets of complaints would be contrary to the\n\npurpose of the enactment. As noted above, it is the compensatory aspect of the\n\nremedy that should be given priority as opposed to the punitive aspect. The\n\ncomplainant in such cases is primarily concerned with the recovery of money, the\n\nconviction of the accused serves little purpose. In fact, the threat of jail acts as a\n\nstick to ensure payment of money. This Court in <a href=\"/doc/635335/\" id=\"a_86\">R. Vijayan v. Baby</a> 27 has\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_71\">27</span>\n     (2012) 1 SCC 260\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_72\">                                                  25</span>\n\f                                                                               PART C\n\nemphasised how punishment of the offender is of a secondary concern for the\n\ncomplainant in the following terms:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">             “17. The apparent intention is to ensure that not only the\n             offender is punished, but also ensure that the complainant\n             invariably receives the amount of the cheque by way of\n             compensation Under Section 357(1)(b) of the Code. Though\n             a complaint Under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_87\">Section 138</a> of the Act is in regard to\n             criminal liability for the offence of dishonouring the cheque\n             and not for the recovery of the cheque amount (which strictly\n             speaking, has to be enforced by a civil suit), in practice once\n             the criminal complaint is lodged Under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_88\">Section 138</a> of the Act,\n             a civil suit is seldom filed to recover the amount of the\n             cheque. This is because of the provision enabling the court to\n             levy a fine linked to the cheque amount and the usual\n             direction in such cases is for payment as compensation, the\n             cheque amount, as loss incurred by the complainant on\n             account of dishonour of cheque. Under Section 357(1)(b) of\n             the Code and the provision for compounding the offences\n             Under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_89\">Section 138</a> of the Act most of the cases (except those\n             where liability is denied) get compounded at one stage or the\n             other by payment of the cheque amount with or without\n             interest. Even where the offence is not compounded, the\n             courts tend to direct payment of compensation equal to the\n             cheque amount (or even something more towards interest) by\n             levying a fine commensurate with the cheque amount. A\n             stage has reached when most of the complainants, in\n             particular the financing institutions (particularly private\n             financiers) view the proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_90\">Section 138</a> of the\n             Act, as a proceeding for the recovery of the cheque amount,\n             the punishment of the drawer of the cheque for the offence of\n             dishonour, becoming secondary.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_76\">38    When a complainant party enters into a compromise agreement with the\n\naccused, it may be for a multitude of reasons – higher compensation, faster\n\nrecovery of money, uncertainty of trial and strength of the complaint, among others.\n\nA complainant enters into a settlement with open eyes and undertakes the risk of the\n\naccused failing to honour the cheques issued pursuant to the settlement, based on\n\ncertain benefits that the settlement agreement postulates. Once parties have\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_73\">                                               26</span>\n\f                                                                               PART C\n\nvoluntarily entered into such an agreement and agree to abide by the consequences\n\nof non-compliance of the settlement agreement, they cannot be allowed to reverse\n\nthe effects of the agreement by pursuing both the original complaint and the\n\nsubsequent complaint arising from such non-compliance. The settlement agreement\n\nsubsumes the original complaint. Non-compliance of the terms of the settlement\n\nagreement or dishonour of cheques issued subsequent to it, would then give rise to\n\na fresh cause of action attracting liability under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_91\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act and other\n\nremedies under civil law and criminal law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_77\">\n39    A contrary interpretation, which allows for the complainant to pursue both the\n\noriginal complaint and the consequences arising out of the settlement agreement,\n\nwould lead to contradictory results. First, it would allow for the accused to be\n\nprosecuted and undergo trial for two different complaints, which in its essence arise\n\nout of one underlying legal liability. Second, the accused would then face criminal\n\nliability for not just the violation of the original agreement of the transaction which\n\nhad resulted in issuance of the first set of cheques, but also the cheques issued\n\npursuant to the compromise deed. Third, instead of reducing litigation and ensuring\n\nfaster recovery of money, it would increase the burden of the criminal justice system\n\nwhere judicial time is being spent on adjudicating an offence which is essentially in\n\nthe nature of a civil wrong affecting private parties – a problem noted in multiple\n\njudgements of this Court cited above. Most importantly, allowing the complainant to\n\npursue parallel proceedings, one resulting from the original complaint and the\n\nsecond emanating from the terms of the settlement would make the settlement and\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_74\">                                          27</span>\n\f                                                                                  PART C\n\nissuance of fresh cheques or any other partial payment made towards the original\n\nliability meaningless. Such an interpretation would discourage settlement of matters\n\nsince they do not have any effect on the status quo, and in fact increase the\n\nprotracted litigation before the court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_78\">\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1594211\" id=\"span_75\">40        Thus, in our view, a complainant cannot pursue two parallel prosecutions for\n\nthe same underlying transaction. Once a settlement agreement has been entered\n\ninto by the parties, the proceedings in the original complaint cannot be sustained\n\nand a fresh cause of action accrues to the complainant under the terms of the\n\nsettlement deed. It has been urged by Mr V Giri, learned Senior Counsel, and Ms Liz\n\nMathew, learned counsel, that parallel prosecutions would not lead to a multiplicity\n\nof proceedings, as in the present case, both complaints are being tried by the same\n\ncourt. This may be true for the case before us, however, this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1594211/\" id=\"a_92\">Damodar S.\n\nPrabhu</a> (supra) and Re: Expeditious Trial of Cases (supra) has recognized\n\nmultiplicity of complaints as one of the major reasons for delay in trial of cases under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_93\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act and the consequent choking of the criminal justice system\n\nby a disproportionate number of <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_94\">Section 138</a> cases. While it is true that the trial in\n\nthis case is before one court, that is not necessarily the ground reality in all cases.</span>\n\n\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"50830542\" id=\"span_76\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"584388\" id=\"span_77\">41        At this stage, it may be necessary to dwell on the decision of this Court in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/584388/\" id=\"a_95\">Lalit Kumar Sharma v.

The\n\ncheques were returned unpaid for “insufficiency of funds”. A complaint was instituted\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_98\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act against the two directors. The appellants, who were\n\nalso directors of the said company, were not signatories to the cheques and had not\n\nbeen made parties to the complaint. During the pendency of the complaint, an\n\nagreement was entered into between Manish Arora, Ashish Narula and the\n\ncomplainant under which it was envisaged that if a cheque for Rs.5,02,050/- was\n\nissued, the complaint would be withdrawn. Manish Arora issued a cheque which was\n\nreturned on presentation for insufficiency of funds. Meanwhile, Ashish Narula and\n\nthe company entered into an agreement stating that the liability arising from the said\n\ntransaction was of the director personally, and not of the company. Another\n\ncomplaint was filed on the basis of the return of the subsequent cheque, where\n\nManish Arora and Ashish Narula and the appellants were made parties. In this\n\nbackdrop, the Court noted that in respect of the first cheques, the appellants were\n\nnot proceeded against and though a compromise was entered into between Manish\n\nArora and Ashish Narula and the complainant, the complaint had not been\n\nwithdrawn and the two directors had been found guilty of an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_99\">Section\n\n138</a> of NI Act. Manish Arora had issued the second cheque in terms of the\n\nsettlement between the parties. It was in this backdrop, that the Court observed:</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">             “15. Evidently, therefore, the second cheque was issued in\n             terms of the compromise. It did not create a new liability. As\n             the compromise did not fructify, the same cannot be said to\n             have been issued towards payment of debt.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">             […]\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_82\">                                              29</span>\n\f                                                                               PART C\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">             17. Thus, the second cheque was issued by Manish Arora for\n             the purpose of arriving at a settlement. The said cheque was\n             not issued in discharge of the debt or liability of the Company\n             of which the appellants were said to be the Directors. There\n             was only one transaction between Shri Ashish Narula, Shri\n             Manish Arora, Directors of the Company and the complainant.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_79\">             They have already been punished. Thus, the question of\n             entertaining the second complaint did not arise. It was, in our\n             opinion, wholly misconceived. The appeal, therefore, in our\n             opinion, must be allowed. It is directed accordingly. The\n             respondent shall bear the costs of the appellants. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"584388\" id=\"span_83\">Counsel’s\n             fee assessed at Rs. 25,000.”\n\n\n42    The Court noted that the second cheque was issued by Manish Arora for\n\narriving at the settlement in his personal capacity and not in discharge of a debt or\n\nliability of the company. There was only one transaction between Manish Arora and\n\nAshish Narula and the complainant for which there was an order of conviction and\n\npunishment. It was in this background that the Court held that the question of\n\nentertaining the second complaint against the appellants did not arise because the\n\ncheques issued pursuant to the settlement were not issued in discharge of the debt\n\nor liability of the company of which the appellants were the directors. Thus, the\n\ndecision in <a href=\"/doc/584388/\" id=\"a_100\">Lalit Kumar Sharma</a> (supra) is not applicable in the present case as\n\nthere was already an adjudication on the question of liability and a conviction with\n\nrespect to the first cheque.

Once the ingredients of <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_120\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act are\n\nfulfilled, the statute clearly stipulates that “such person shall be deemed to have\n\ncommitted an offence”. Thus, once the ingredients of <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_121\">Section 138</a> are fulfilled, a\n\ndistinct offence arises in respect of the dishonour of the cheques in question. There\n\nwas no basis for the learned Single Judge to conclude, particularly in the course of\n\nthe hearing of a petition under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_122\">Section 482</a> of the CrPC that the second set of\n\ncheques issued in pursuance of the deed of compromise cannot be construed as\n\nbeing towards the discharge of a liability. The question as to whether the liability\n\nexists or not is clearly a matter of trial. There was a serious error on the part of the\n\nSingle Judge in allowing the petition under Section 482 to quash the prosecution on\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_99\">                                          34</span>\n\f                                                                              PART C\n\nthe basis that the deed of compromise would not constitute a legally enforceable\n\nliability. The mere fact that a suit is pending before the High Court challenging the\n\nvalidity of the compromise deed would furnish no cogent basis to quash the\n\nproceedings under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_123\">Section 138</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_87\">\n49     Mr Jayant Bhushan, learned Senior Counsel has made an earnest attempt to\n\nurge that under <a href=\"/doc/409770/\" id=\"a_124\">Section 39</a> of the Indian Contract Act 1872 when a party to contract\n\nhas refused to perform his promise in its entirety; the promisee has the option of\n\nputting an end to the contract unless he signifies his acquiescence in its\n\ncontinuance.

The deed of compromise, according to the submission,\n\nrepresented a novation. Extending this line of argument, it was urged that it was the\n\nappellant who did not withdraw the criminal proceedings and pursued with the\n\narbitration in which event its conduct must be construed to amount to repudiation of\n\nthe settlement. Thus, it has been urged that the appellant can only insist on the\n\nenforcement of the liability in relation to the first set of cheques.\n\n\n50     We are unable to accept the line of argument on two grounds. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"103637947\" id=\"span_100\">First, as held\n\nabove, a settlement agreement effaces the original complaint and thus, it is not up to\n\nthe parties, either complainant or accused, to simply reverse the effects of that\n\nagreement and relitigate the original complaint relating to the same underlying\n\ntransaction under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_126\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act. Second, the breach of the deed of\n\ncompromise has arisen due to the dishonour of the cheques which were issued by\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_101\">                                            35</span>\n\f                                                                                      PART C\n\nthe accused towards discharge of the remaining balance of Rs. 7 crores.

In the reply to the notice which was\n                  given by the appellant, the accused took the defence that the\n                  cheque was stolen by the appellant. The said defence was\n                  rejected by the trial court after considering the evidence on\n                  record with regard to which no contrary view has also been\n                  expressed by the High Court.”\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_91\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"50830542\" id=\"span_110\">53        <a href=\"/doc/268919/\" id=\"a_146\">Section 139</a> raises the presumption “unless the contrary is proved”. Once the\n\ncomplainant discharges the burden of proving that the instrument was executed by\n\nthe accused; the presumption under <a href=\"/doc/268919/\" id=\"a_147\">Section 139</a> shifts the burden on the accused.\n\nThe expression “unless the contrary is proved” would demonstrate that it is only for\n\nthe accused at the trial to adduce evidence of such facts or circumstances on the\n\nbasis of which the burden would stand discharged. These are matters of evidence\n\nand trial. As held in <a href=\"/doc/50830542/\" id=\"a_148\">Arun Kumar</a> (supra) and discussed above, the determination of\n\nwhether a cheque pursuant to a settlement agreement arises out of a legal liability\n\nwould be dependent on various factors, such as the underlying settlement\n\nagreement, the nature of the original transaction and whether an adjudication on the\n\nfinding of liability was arrived at in the original complaint, the defence raised by the\n\naccused, etc. The Single Judge was in error in proceeding to quash the criminal\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_111\">34</span>\n     (2018) 8 SCC 165\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_112\">                                                   38</span>\n\f                                                                             PART C\n\ncomplaint on a priori reasoning that the second set of cheques issued in pursuance\n\nof the deed of compromise were not in discharge of a liability and on that basis\n\nproceeding to quash the proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_149\">Section 482</a> CrPC. The mere fact that a\n\nsuit has been instituted before the Madras High Court challenging the deed of\n\ncompromise would furnish no justification for exercising the jurisdiction under\n\nSection 482. The deed of compromise would continue to be valid until a decree of\n\nthe appropriate court setting it aside is passed. The High Court, as we have\n\nexplained above, has failed to notice the true meaning and import of the\n\npresumption under <a href=\"/doc/268919/\" id=\"a_150\">Section 139</a> which can only be displaced on the basis of\n\nevidence adduced at the trial.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_92\">\n54    A submission was urged by the appellants that in the event the second\n\ncomplaint is found to be non-maintainable and the compromise deed is held to be\n\ninvalid, they would be left remediless and thus, the first trial should be allowed to\n\ncontinue. We do not find any merit in this submission. In the event that the\n\ncompromise deed is found to be void ab initio on account of coercion, the very basis\n\nfor quashing of the first complaint is removed since the settlement agreement is\n\ndeemed to have never existed and hence it had no effect on the liability subsisting\n\nunder the first complaint. The appellants may then approach the competent court for\n\nreinstatement of the original complaint and the trial can proceed on that basis.</p><pre id=\"pre_5\">\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_113\">                                         39</span>\n\f                                                                            PART D\n\nD      Conclusion\n\n\n\n55     For the above reasons, we hereby pass the following order:\n\n\n(i)    We are of the view that the Single Judge was in error in quashing the\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_93\">       complaint CC No. 389/2017 pending on the file of the Seventh Metropolitan\n\n       Magistrate, Chennai.
