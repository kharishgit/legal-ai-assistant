We have carefully considered the submissions\n\n     made on behalf of the respective parties and\n\n     the facts involved in this case, and we are not\n\n     inclined to accept Mr. Singh&#x27;s contention that\n\n     the   decision      in    <a href=\"/doc/469138/\" id=\"a_25\">B.S.    Joshi</a>&#x27;s   case    requires\n\n     reconsideration, at least not in the facts of\n\n     this case.          What was decided in B.S. Joshi&#x27;s\n\n     case was the power and authority of the High\n\n     Court to exercise jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_26\">Section\n\n     482</a>    CrPC    or        under    <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_27\">Article    226</a>    of    the\n\n     Constitution to quash offences which are not\n\n     compoundable.        The law stated in the said case\n\n     simply indicates the powers of the High Court\n\n     to    quash   any     criminal      proceeding     or    First\n\n     Information Report or complaint whether it be\n\n     compoundable or not.             The ultimate exercise of\n\n     discretion     under      <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_28\">Section    482</a>    CrPC   or    under\n\n     <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_29\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution is                 with the\n\n     Court which has to exercise such jurisdiction\n\n     in    the   facts    of    each    case.     It    has   been\n\n     explained that the said power is in no way\n\n     limited by the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/91933/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 320</a> CrPC.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">\f                                                                           6</span>\n\n\n     We are unable to disagree with such statement\n\n     of law.         In any event, in this case, we are\n\n     only    required     to       consider      whether       the     High\n\n     Court     had    exercised          its    jurisdiction          under\n\n     <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. legally and correctly.</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">7.   In view of the nature of the offences set out\n\n     in     the   complaint,         the     High     Court     did    not\n\n     consider it an appropriate case for exercising\n\n     its     jurisdiction       under        <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_32\">Article     226</a>     of     the\n\n     Constitution for quashing the same.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_15\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">8.   In     our   view,      the     High      Court&#x27;s    refusal          to\n\n     exercise its jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_33\">Article 226</a> of\n\n     the     Constitution          for     quashing      the    criminal\n\n     proceedings       cannot       be     supported.          The    First\n\n     Information Report, which had been lodged by\n\n     the complainant indicates a dispute between the\n\n     complainant       and     the       accused    which      is     of       a\n\n     private nature.          It is no doubt true that the\n\n     First Information Report was the basis of the\n\n     investigation by the Police authorities, but\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">\f                                                             7</span>\n\n\n     the dispute between the parties remained one of\n\n     a   personal     nature.         Once    the    complainant\n\n     decided not to pursue the matter further, the\n\n     High Court could have taken a more pragmatic\n\n     view of the matter.             We do not suggest that\n\n     while exercising its powers under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_34\">Article 226</a>\n\n     of the Constitution the High Court could not\n\n     have   refused     to   quash    the    First   Information\n\n     Report, but what we do say is that the matter\n\n     could have been considered by the High Court\n\n     with greater pragmatism in the facts of the\n\n     case. As we have indicated hereinbefore, the\n\n     exercise of power under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. or\n\n     <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_36\">Article      226</a>        of   the        Constitution    is\n\n     discretionary to be exercised in the facts of\n\n     each case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_17\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_18\">9.   In the facts of this case we are of the view\n\n     that continuing with the criminal proceedings\n\n     would be an exercise in futility.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">\f                                                           8</span><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_19\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_20\">10.

The cheques received from me, encashed\n             him in different-different names instead depositing in the\n             account of Real Auto Deals. When it has come to my\n             notice that he is playing fraud with me, then visited the\n             bank and got stopped the payment of the cheques. He\n             came to me when the cheque was dishonoured and asked\n             me why you stop the payment.

Vijay Lakshmi Finance, Real Auto Deals and\n             Man Mohan Sharma, have sold my vehicle to some other\n             place by making my forged signatures and by playing\n             fraud with me, in connivance of each other.

Ordinarily we would have agreed with Mr. B.B. Singh.

As observed by this Court in the above decisions, there\n\nis a broad separation of powers in the Constitution and it would not be\n\nproper for one organ of the State to encroach into the domain of another\n\norgan.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_48\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_49\">17.      Since <a href=\"/doc/91933/\" id=\"a_73\">Section 320</a> Cr.P.C. has clearly stated which offences are\n\ncompoundable and which are not, the High Court or even this Court would\n\nnot ordinarily be justified in doing something indirectly which could not be\n\ndone directly.    Even otherwise, it ordinarily would not be a legitimate\n\nexercise of judicial power under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_74\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution or under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_75\">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. to direct doing something which the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_76\">Cr.P.C</a>. has\n\nexpressly prohibited.    <a href=\"/doc/1058165/\" id=\"a_77\">Section 320(9)</a> Cr.P.C. expressly states that no\n\noffence shall be compounded except as provided by that Section. Hence, in\n\nmy opinion, it would ordinarily not be a legitimate exercise of judicial\n\npower to direct compounding of a non-compoundable offence.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">\f                                                                          17</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_50\">18.   However, it has to be pointed out that <a href=\"/doc/91933/\" id=\"a_78\">Section 320</a> Cr.P.C. cannot be\n\nread in isolation. It has to be read along with the other provisions in the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_79\">Cr.P.C</a>. One such other provision is <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_80\">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. which reads:\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">             &quot; Saving of inherent power of High Court. - Nothing\n             in this Code shall be deemed to limit or affect the\n             inherent powers of the High Court to make such orders\n             as may be necessary to give effect to any order under this\n             Code, or to prevent abuse of the process of any Court or\n             otherwise to secure the ends of justice.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_51\">19.   The words &quot;Nothing in this Code&quot; used in Section 482 is a non\n\nobstante clause, and gives it overriding effect over other provisions in the\n\nCr.P.C. The words &quot;or otherwise to secure the ends of justice&quot; in Section\n\n482 implies that to secure the interest of justice sometimes (though only in\n\nvery rare cases) the High Court can pass an order in violation of a provision\n\nin the Cr.P.C.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_52\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1484899\" id=\"span_34\">20.
