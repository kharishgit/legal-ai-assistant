The case of the complainant, as emerging from the complaint and the\nevidence led by the complainant, was that the complainant had invested\nmonies, from time to time, in the business of the accused. A sum of Rs.3\nLakhs was outstanding after accounting for the monies returned by the\naccused to the complainant. The accused - acting as the first party, entered\ninto a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) dated 26.06.2011 with the\nappellant - acting as the second party, for return of the said remaining\ninvestment of Rs.3 lakhs to the complainant. The relevant extract of the\nMOU (Ex.CW-1/4), inter alia, reads as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">      &quot;.................\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">      and whereas the second party Sh. Suresh Chandra Goyal has\n      invested a sum of Rs. 3,00,000.00 (Rs. Three Lakhs only) in the\n      month of June, 2010 and onwards by cash &amp; various cheques\n      by way of partnership on 50-50% basis. The Partnership was\n      broken by way of mutual consent in first week of December,\n      2010.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">      and whereas both the parties agreed that First party will return\n      full amount of Rs. 3,00,000/- (Rs. Three Lakhs only) to Second\n      Party Sh. Suresh Chandra Goyal in six instalment of Rs.\n      50,000.00 (Rs. Fifty thousand only) by way of six monthly\n      cheque starting from December, 2011 and Second Party Suresh\n      Chandra Goyal will return all security cheque drawn in favour\n      of second party, if any. It is also agreed upon by all the parties\n      that interest @ 1.5% per month will be charged if there is any\n      delay in getting the cheques cleared by the first party.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">CRL.L.P.

Thus, the complainant held six cheques of Rs. 50,000/ each, given by\nthe accused in terms of the MoU (Ex.PW1/4). The appellant/complainant\nadmitted the receipt of Rs.1.50 lakhs out of the aforesaid amount. Three\ncheques in respect thereof were returned to the accused when the said\namount of Rs. 1.50 lakhs was returned in installments of Rs. 50,000/- each.\nThe appellant/complainant claimed that the accused, in order to repay the\nremaining amount of Rs. 1.50 Lakhs issued three cheques of Rs. 50,000/-\neach, bearing Nos. 864160, 864161 &amp; 864162 dated 15.01.2012, 15.02.2012\n&amp; 15.03.2012 respectively, drawn on Axis Bank, Preet Vihar Branch, Delhi,\nin favour of the appellant, which were exhibited as Ex.CW1/1, CW1/2 and\nCW1/3.     The said cheques were presented and were dishonoured upon\npresentation on account of insufficient funds. After issuance of the statutory\nnotice dated 04.08.2012 under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 138</a> NI Act, since the accused did not\nmake payment, the complaint was preferred. The accused admitted, while\nmaking his statement under <a href=\"/doc/429078/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 251</a> Cr.P.C., that he was liable to make\npayment to the appellant/ complainant of Rs.60,000/-, but denied that the\nliability was Rs.1,50,000/-.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">7.    The submission of learned counsel for the appellant is that the learned\nMagistrate, while acquitting the accused, has given two reasons in the\nimpugned judgment. The first is that the petitioner has not been able to\nestablish that a debt was owed by the accused towards the appellant-thus, it\ncould not be said that the cheques Exs.CW1/1, CW1/2 and CW1/3 were\nissued in discharge of a debt; secondly, the learned Magistrate had held that\nthe cheques in question were given as security cheques and, therefore, could\nnot form the basis of a complaint under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">CRL.L.P. No.706/2014                                        Page 3 of 36</span>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\"> 8.    In respect of the first reason, the submission of learned counsel for the\nappellant is that MOU (Ex.CW-1/4) itself reflects the debt owed by the\naccused, and the undertaking given by him that the same shall be returned in\nsix monthly installments from December, 2011, onwards of Rs. 50,000/-\neach. Learned counsel submits that in the face of the acknowledgement of\ndebt contained in the MOU (Ex.CW-1/4), and the statement of the accused\nthat he was indebted to the appellant/complainant - though to the extent of\nRs.60,000/- and not Rs.1.50 lakhs, the exercise undertaken by the learned\nMagistrate to ascertain whether the accused was indebted to the appellant,\nand the doubt entertained by the learned Magistrate with regard to the said\ndebt, itself was misdirected, and it was not open to Magistrate to go behind\nthe MOU (Ex.CW-1/4) to make an inquiry as to whether, or not, the debt\nexisted.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\">9.    The further submission of learned counsel for the appellant is that the\nMOU (Ex.CW-1/4) itself recorded that the repayment had to be made in six\nmonthly installments.    He submits that the learned Magistrate has placed\nreliance on the cross-examination of the appellant, who was examined as\nCW-1, as also the language used in MOU (Ex.CW-1/4) - to the effect that\nthe complainant/ appellant shall return the security cheques drawn in his\nfavour, upon the installments being paid- to hold that the cheques in\nquestion were &quot;security cheques;&quot; and were not meant for payment of a\nlegally recoverable debt.     Learned counsel has referred to the cross-\nexamination of the appellant&#x27;s/ complainant&#x27;s witness to submit that the\naccused never challenged the genuineness, or authenticity of the MOU\n(Ex.CW-1/4). In fact, the suggestion was that the complainant had received\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">CRL.L.P. No.706/2014                                         Page 4 of 36</span>\n a sum of Rs. 1.50 Lakhs in respect of the outstanding liability/ debt of Rs. 3\nLakhs. The further submission of the appellant is that the statement of the\naccused that the outstanding liability was only to the tune of Rs.60,000/- and\nnot Rs.1.50 lakhs, was his mere ipse dixit, which was not shown to be even\nprobably true. The same did not dislodge the presumption under <a href=\"/doc/517539/\" id=\"a_6\">Section\n118</a> and <a href=\"/doc/268919/\" id=\"a_7\">139</a> of the NI Act, which arose on account of the indisputed\nposition that the cheques Ex.CW1/1, CW1/2 and CW1/3 had been\nissued/signed by the accused drawn from the bank account maintained by\nhim.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_12\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"53206885\" id=\"span_5\">10.    On the other hand, the submission of learned counsel for the accused\nsupports the impugned judgment. He submits that the appellant could not\nestablish the availability of monetary liquidity with him, to show that he had\nadvanced any loan, and that Rs. 3 Lakhs was outstanding. The claim made\nby the appellant/ complainant, that he had earlier too advanced a loan of Rs.\n3 Lakhs, out of which only Rs. 2 Lakhs had been returned was not\nbelievable, as there was no reason for the petitioner to invest a further\namount in the business of the accused - when the initially invested amount\nhad not been fully returned. He further submits that the petitioner had\nadmitted during his cross-examination that the cheques in question had been\ngiven as security cheques. He has placed reliance on the decisions taken\nnote of in the impugned judgment as well as on the decision of Supreme\nCourt in <a href=\"/doc/53206885/\" id=\"a_8\">Vijay Vs. Laxman &amp; Anr.</a>, (2013) 3 SCC 86. Learned counsel has\nalso referred to the statement of the accused recorded before the learned\nMagistrate on 02.07.2014, wherein he admitted his liability to the extent of\nRs.60,000/- only.</span>\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">CRL.L.P. No.706/2014                                        Page 5 of 36</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"127405\" id=\"span_7\">11.     The scope of interference with a judgment of acquittal, in appeal, by\nthe Appellate Court, has been noticed by the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/127405/\" id=\"a_9\">Ghurey Lal\nVs. State of Uttar Pradesh</a>, (2008) 10 SCC 450, wherein the Supreme Court\nheld:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">        &quot;70.

Therefore, the impugned judgment has to be tested in the aforesaid\nlight.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_16\">13.      The MOU (Ex. CW-1/4) has been duly proved by the appellant/\ncomplainant.      The accused has not challenged the genuineness and\nauthenticity of the MOU (Ex. CW-1/4) executed between him (as the first\nparty), and the appellant/ complainant (as the second party). This MOU\nacknowledges the debt owed by the accused in favour of the appellant/\ncomplainant of Rs.3 Lakhs. The MOU, inter alia, records &quot;and whereas\nboth the parties agreed that First party will return full amount of\nRs.3,00,000/- (Rs. Three Lakhs only) to Second Party Sh. Suresh Chandra\nGoyal in six instalment of Rs. 50,000.00 (Rs. Fifty thousand only) by way of\nsix monthly cheque starting from December, 2011 ... ... ... ... ...&quot;. Thus, the\nfactum of the debt of Rs.3 Lakhs being owed by the accused to the\nappellant/ complainant stands duly proved and established by the MOU (Ex.\nCW-1/4).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_17\">14.      The approach of the learned Magistrate in doubting the existence of\nthe debt, and in going behind MOU (Ex. CW-1/4) is clearly misdirected. No\nfurther inquiry was called for on the said aspect since the MOU (Ex. CW-\n1/4) was not even challenged by the accused, and the exercise undertaken by\nthe learned Magistrate was even barred by law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_18\">15.      The endeavour of the learned Magistrate to go behind the MOU (Ex.\nCW-1/4) was not permissible, in view of <a href=\"/doc/205529/\" id=\"a_10\">Sections 91</a> &amp; <a href=\"/doc/1790262/\" id=\"a_11\">92</a> of the Evidence\nAct. When the terms of a contract have been reduced to the form of a\ndocument, no evidence could be given in proof of terms of such contract,\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">CRL.L.P. No.706/2014                                       Page 7 of 36</span>\n except the document itself. The two exceptions and three explanations to\n<a href=\"/doc/205529/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 91</a> of the Evidence Act do not come into play in the facts of the\npresent case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">16.   The accused admitted as correct the suggestion that to discharge the\nlegal liability towards the complainant, he had issued three post-dated\ncheques in question, namely Ex.CW-1/1, CW-1/2 &amp; CW-1/3. However, he\nqualified his admission by stating that the cheques were given as security.\nHe did not dispute the legal liability owed to the appellant. But he admitted\nhis liability to the extent of Rs.60,000/- only, and not of the amount of\nRs.1,50,000/-.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_20\">17.   <a href=\"/doc/1790262/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 92</a> of the Evidence Act provides that when the terms of any\nsuch contract have been proved according to <a href=\"/doc/891368/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 91</a>, no evidence of any\noral agreement, or statement shall be admitted as between the parties to any\nsuch instrument, or their representatives in interest for the purpose of\ncontradicting, varying, adding to and subtracting from its terms. Thus, the\naccused could not have sought to contradict the MOU (Ex. CW-1/4) by\nclaiming that an amount of Rs.3 Lakhs was not owed by the accused, or\nrefundable in terms of the MOU (Ex. CW-1/4) to the appellant/ complainant.\nPertinently, the accused did not set up a defence in terms of provisos 1 to 6\nto <a href=\"/doc/1790262/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 92</a> of the Evidence Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">18.   Thus, in my view, the approach of the learned Magistrate was\ncompletely misdirected in law, in proceeding to examine the issue whether\nthe debt in question was owed by the accused to the appellant/ complainant.\nThe finding returned by the learned Magistrate on the said issue is clearly\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">CRL.L.P. No.706/2014                                       Page 8 of 36</span>\n contrary to the terms of the MOU (Ex. CW-1/4), and certainly cannot be\nsustained. It is even contrary to the statement/stand of the accused that he\nwas indebted to the complainant, though to the extent of Rs. 60,000/- and\nnot to the extent of Rs. 1.50 lakhs. The finding returned by the learned\nMagistrate on the aforesaid aspect cannot even be termed as one of the\nplausible views. It is a finding, which the learned Magistrate could not have\nreturned in the face of the terms contained in the MOU (Ex. CW-1/4), and\nthe stand of the accused.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_22\">19.   The defence set up by the accused that his outstanding liability was\nRs.60,000/-, and not Rs.1.5 lakhs is merely an ipsi dixit of the accused.\nNeither on a reading of the complaint, nor from the evidence led by the\ncomplainant and the cross examination of the complainants witness, the\naccused has been able to create a reasonable doubt with regard to the\nquantum of the outstanding debt. The accused has also not led any evidence\nto show that the outstanding liability was Rs.60,000/-, and not Rs.1.5 lakhs.\nThe accused, to rebut the presumption under <a href=\"/doc/268919/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 139</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/517539/\" id=\"a_17\">Section\n118</a> of the NI Act, has to set up at least a probable defence. The defence\ncannot be frivolous or moonshine. It cannot be merely a &quot;possible&quot; defence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"8322296\" id=\"span_11\">20.   This Court in <a href=\"/doc/8322296/\" id=\"a_18\">V.S. Yadav v. Reena</a>, 172 (2010) DLT 561, commented\non the obligation of the accused while setting up a defence to repulse the\npresumption created by virtue of <a href=\"/doc/517539/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 118</a> and <a href=\"/doc/268919/\" id=\"a_20\">139</a> of the NI Act as\nfollows:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">      &quot;5. It must be borne in mind that the statement of accused under\n      <a href=\"/doc/224316/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 281</a> Cr.P.C. or under <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C. is not the\n      evidence of the accused and it cannot be read as part of\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">CRL.L.P. No.706/2014                                       Page 9 of 36</span>\n       evidence. The accused has an option to examine himself as a\n      witness. Where the accused does not examine himself as a\n      witness, his statement under <a href=\"/doc/224316/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 281</a> Cr.P.C. or 313\n      <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_24\">Cr.P.C</a>. cannot be read as evidence of the accused and it has to\n      be looked into only as an explanation of the incriminating\n      circumstance and not as evidence. There is no presumption of\n      law that explanation given by the accused was truthful. In the\n      present case, the accused in his statement stated that he had\n      given cheques as security. If the accused wanted to prove this,\n      he was supposed to appear in the witness box and testify and\n      get himself subjected to cross examination. His explanation that\n      he had the cheques as security for taking loan from the\n      complainant but no loan was given should not have been\n      considered by the Trial Court as his evidence and this was\n      liable to be rejected since the accused did not appear in the\n      witness box to dispel the presumption that the cheques were\n      issued as security. Mere suggestion to the witness that cheques\n      were issued as security or mere explanation given in the\n      statement of accused under <a href=\"/doc/224316/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 281</a> Cr.P.C., that the\n      cheques were issued as security, does not amount to proof.\n      Moreover, the Trial Court seemed to be obsessed with idea of\n      proof beyond reasonable doubt forgetting that offence under\n      <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 138</a> of N.I. Act was a technical offence and the\n      complainant is only supposed to prove that the cheques issued\n      by the respondent were dishonoured, his statement that cheques\n      were issued against liability or debt is sufficient proof of the\n      debt or liability and the onus shifts to the respondent/ accused\n      to show the circumstances under which the cheques came to be\n      issued and this could be proved by the respondent only by way\n      of evidence and not by leading no evidence.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">21.   The Court further observed:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">      &quot;7. ... ... ... Mere pleading not guilty and stating that the\n      cheques were issued as security, would not give amount to\n      rebutting the presumption raised under <a href=\"/doc/268919/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 139</a> of N.I. Act.\n      If mere statement under <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C. or under <a href=\"/doc/224316/\" id=\"a_29\">Section\n      281</a> Cr.P.C. of accused of pleading not guilty was sufficient to\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">CRL.L.P.

But, it is\n      not the law. In order to rebut the presumption under <a href=\"/doc/268919/\" id=\"a_30\">Section\n      139</a> of N.I. Act, the accused, by cogent evidence, has to prove\n      the circumstance under which cheques were issued. It was for\n      the accused to prove if no loan was taken why he did not write\n      a letter to the complainant for return of the cheque. Unless the\n      accused had proved that he acted like a normal\n      businessman/prudent person entering into a contract he could\n      not have rebutted the presumption under <a href=\"/doc/268919/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 139</a> N.I. Act. If\n      no loan was given, but cheques were retained, he immediately\n      would have protested and asked the cheques to be returned and\n      if still cheques were not returned, he would have served a\n      notice as complainant. Nothing was proved in this case&quot;.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_25\">22.   The accused did not lead any evidence to show that apart from the\namount of Rs.1.5 lakhs, admittedly returned to the appellant/complainant\nafter the execution of the MOU (Ex. CW-1/4), a further sum of Rs.90,000/-\nwas returned by the accused to the complainant. The accused did not step\ninto the witness box to stand by his defence in this respect. He did not\nproduce any documentary evidence in the form of an acknowledgment or\nreceipt nor claimed that one had been, issued by the complainant, to show\nthat the said amount, i.e. Rs.90,000/- had been paid to the complainant over\nand above the amount of Rs.1.5 lakhs admitted and acknowledged by the\ncomplainant. He did not produce any other person as a witness in whose\npresence the amount may have been returned.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\">23.   The parties, admittedly, recorded the outstanding liability of the\naccused, existing on the date of the execution of the MOU (Ex. CW-1/4). In\nthis light, it does not stand to reason as to why they would not record the\nrepayment of the amount of Rs.90,000/- in some form, if the money had\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">CRL.L.P. No.706/2014                                     Page 11 of 36</span>\n actually been so returned by the accused to the complainant. Pertinently,\nCW-1 in his deposition stated that at the time of repayment of Rs.1.5 lakhs\nin three instalments of Rs.50,000/- each, not only three security cheques\nwere returned by the complainant to the accused, but the accused also got\nthe vouchers signed from the complainant. On this aspect, there was no\nchallenge raised by the accused during the course of the complainants cross\nexamination. Thus, if the amount of Rs.90,000/- had been returned, over\nand above the amount of Rs.1.5 lakhs, the accused would have been holding\nnot only a receipt/acknowledgment given by the complainant, but the\ncomplainant would not have been in possession of all the three remaining\nsecurity cheques (Ex. CW-1/1, CW-1/2 &amp; CW-1/3) of Rs. 50,000/- each. At\nleast, one of them would have been returned to the accused. Thus, it stands\nestablished beyond all reasonable doubt that the debt of Rs.1.50 lakhs was\noutstanding and payable by the accused to the complainant when the three\ncheques in question were presented for payment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_27\">24.   The next issue that needs examination is whether the complaint of the\nappellant was maintainable under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act since the\ncheques in question were &quot;security cheques&quot;. The MOU (Ex. CW-1/4) itself\nprovides that the first party/ accused will return the amount of Rs.3 Lakhs to\nthe second party/ appellant in six installments of Rs.50,000/- each by way of\nsix monthly cheques starting from December, 2011 and second party/\nSuresh Chandra Goyal will return all security cheques drawn in favour of\nthe second party, if any. Thus, the MOU (Ex. CW-1/4) provided that the\namount of Rs.3 Lakhs shall be returned by way of six monthly cheques. The\ncomplainant (CW-1) in his cross-examination accepted that he had in his\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">CRL.L.P. No.706/2014                                       Page 12 of 36</span>\n possession some security cheques issued by the accused. He further stated\nthat he had received Rs.1.50 Lakhs in cash from the accused.               He\nvolunteered that the same was received by him in three monthly installments\nof Rs.50,000/- each and that whenever the accused had given a sum of\nRs.50,000/- to him, he had taken back a cheque, and had also got the\nvoucher signed from the complainant. He stated that he did not have the\nsaid security cheques with him anymore. He accepted that the security\ncheques have been filed by him with his complaint before the Court. It is,\ntherefore, evident that the transaction between the parties was that at the\ntime of execution of the MOU (Ex. CW-1/4) six post-dated monthly cheques\nof Rs.50,000/- each towards security were delivered by the accused to the\ncomplainant/ accused.      These cheques were issued in respect of a\ncrystallized and admitted debt of Rs.3 Lakhs. The accused returned Rs.1.50\nLakhs to the complainant in cash, in three installments of Rs.50,000/- each\nand on each such occasion, the complainant returned one cheque of\nRs.50,000/-.   According to the complainant, the remaining amount of\nRs.1.50 Lakhs was not returned and, thus, the appellant proceeded to enforce\nthe security by presenting the three security cheques (Ex. CW-1/1, CW-1/2\n&amp; CW-1/3), which were dishonoured.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">25.   It has come in evidence that the cheques (Ex. CW-1/1, CW-1/2 &amp;\nCW-1/3) were all filled up in all respects by the accused at the time of their\nbeing delivered to the complainant, simultaneously with the execution of the\nMOU (Ex. CW-1/4). The said original cheques are placed on the Trial\nCourt Record which has been summoned and perused, and it is clear to the\nnaked eye that they had been filled by the same person, and in the same ink.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">CRL.L.P.

Even otherwise, merely because the cheque may be blank\nin some or all respects (except that it bears the signatures of the drawer), and\nthe blanks may have been filled in by the drawee subsequently, that by itself\ndoes not invalidate the cheque. It cannot be said that a complaint under\n<a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 138</a> NI Act would not lie in respect of such a cheque, consequent\nupon its dishonor for reason of insufficient funds [see Sandeep Khanna &amp;\nAnr. v.

The submission of learned counsel for the accused is, and the finding\nreturned by the learned Magistrate is, that the said three cheques Ex. CW-\n1/1, CW-1/2 &amp; CW-1/3 being security cheques, could not form the basis of a\ncomplaint under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"53206885\" id=\"span_18\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"186040901\" id=\"span_19\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"533881\" id=\"span_20\">27.

There is no magic in the word &quot;security cheque&quot;, such that, the\nmoment the accused claims that the dishonoured cheque (in respect whereof\na complaint under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 138</a> of the Act is preferred) was given as a\n&quot;security cheque&quot;, the Magistrate would acquit the accused.

There can be mirade situations in which the cheque issued by\nthe accused may be called as security cheque, or may have been issued by\nway of a security, i.e. to provide an assurance or comfort to the drawee, that\nin case of failure of the primary consideration on the due date, or on the\nhappening (or not happening) of a contingency, the security may be\nenforced. While in some situations, the dishonor of such a cheque may\nattract the penal provisions contained in <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 138</a> of the Act, in others it\nmay not.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_33\">29.   To elaborate on the aforesaid aspect, I may consider the different\nkinds of situations that the Courts have dealt with from time to time, and the\nmanner in which the defence of &quot;security cheque&quot;, or that the cheque was\ngiven as a security, set up by the accused, has been dealt with.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_34\">30.   In ICDS Ltd. Vs. Beena Shabeer &amp;Anr. (2002) 6 SCC 426, the\ncheque in question had been issued by the guarantor (wife) of the principal\ndebtor (husband) in respect of a hire purchase agreement entered into by the\nprincipal debtor with the complainant for purchase of a car. The cheque in\nquestion was issued by the guarantor towards part payment to the\nappellant/complainant. The same was returned unpaid on account of\ninsufficient funds. The issue raised before the Supreme Court was whether a\ncomplaint under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act was maintainable in respect of\nthe said cheque. The High Court had come to the conclusion that when a\ncheque was issued as security, no complaint would lie under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 138</a> of\nthe NI Act, since the cheque issued could not be said to be for the purpose of\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">CRL.L.P.

The High Court held that the cheque must\nbe for payment of money from out of the drawer&#x27;s account. In the case of a\ncheque issued by a guarantor or surety, it could not be said to be for\nimmediate payment of money.       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1845877\" id=\"span_23\">The High Court placed reliance on the\ndecision of the Kerala High Court in <a href=\"/doc/1845877/\" id=\"a_45\">Sreenivasan Vs.

The Supreme Court reversed the decision of the High Court by\nplacing reliance on the language of <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_50\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act. <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 138</a>\nbegins with the word, &#x27;where any cheque......&#x27;. These three words were\nheld to be significant. In particular, emphasis was laid on the use of the\nword, &#x27;any&#x27;-which suggests that, if, for whatever reason a cheque drawn on\nan account maintained by the drawer with the banker in favour of another\nperson for the discharge of any debt or other liability is dishonoured, the\nliability under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 138</a> NI Act cannot be avoided. The Supreme Court\nalso emphasized that the legislature had been careful enough to use not only\nthe expression &quot;discharge, in whole or in part, of any debt&quot;, but has also\nincluded the expression &#x27;other liability&#x27; in the language of <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_53\">Section 138</a> NI\nAct. The Supreme Court held that the issue regarding the liability of a\nguarantor and the principal debtor being co-extensive, was out of purview of\n<a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_54\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act and did not call for any discussion. The Supreme\nCourt held:\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">CRL.L.P.

Any contra interpretation\n      would defeat the intent of the legislature. The High Court, it\n      seems, got carried away by the issue of grantee and\n      guarantor&#x27;s liability and thus has overlooked the true intent\n      and purport of <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_56\">Section 138</a> of the Act.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1845877\" id=\"span_26\">Thus, the view taken by the Kerala High Court in <a href=\"/doc/1845877/\" id=\"a_57\">Sreenivasan</a>\n(supra) was clearly not approved by the Supreme Court. The Supreme\nCourt rejected the wide proposition that the dishonour of a security cheque\nissued by a guarantor from his account would not attract <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_58\">Section 138</a> of the\nNI Act.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_37\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"533881\" id=\"span_27\">32.

The Supreme Court examined the nature of the\ntransactions undertaken between the parties in the light of the evidence\nbefore it. The Supreme Court held that the complainant had not been able to\nexplain the discrepancies in his books of accounts.

A collaboration\nagreement was entered into between the complainant, Ansal Buildwell Co.\n(referred to as ABC) - whose directors were the petitioners before the Court\n(in a petition under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_94\">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. seeking quashing of the summoning\norder issued by the Magistrate), and another company who was termed as\nthe confirming party. Clause 5 of the agreement stipulated that, as a security\nfor due performance of the agreement (whereunder the immovable property\nof the complainant had to be developed by ABC), a defined sum was to be\ndeposited by ABC with the complainant and other owners.

The submission\nof the petitioners before the High Court was that the sine qua non for an\naction under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_95\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act is that the dishonored cheque has\nbeen issued towards discharge of &quot;a debt or other liability&quot;.               The\nexpression, &#x27;other liability&#x27; envisaged under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_96\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act was\nakin to a debt or money owed. It was argued that the cheques in question\ncould not be said to have been issued towards payment of a debt or other\nliability, for the reason that the amount covered by the cheques, in terms of\nclause (v) of the collaboration agreement, was liable to be returned by the\ncomplainant to the accused company on the due performance of the\nagreement.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_49\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"533881\" id=\"span_54\">42.   The petitioner had placed reliance on the decision of the Supreme\nCourt in <a href=\"/doc/533881/\" id=\"a_97\">Narayana Menon</a> (supra). This Court held that the expression,\n&#x27;other liability&#x27; could not be construed as akin to &#x27;debt&#x27;. It was held that the\nexpression, &#x27;other liability&#x27; could take its meaning and colour from the\npreceding word, &#x27;debt&#x27;, only if the rule of ejusdem generis is held to be\napplicable. The learned Judge held that the said rule could not be invoked\nbecause the expression, &#x27;other liability&#x27; follows only one single expression\ni.e. &#x27;debt&#x27; which is not a distinct genus.</span> The learned Judge placed reliance\non the judgment of the Supreme Court in Beena Shabeer (supra) to hold that\nthe expression, &#x27;other liability&#x27; must be given its ordinary and grammatical\nmeaning.     The learned Judge held that provisions and phrases used in\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">CRL.L.P. No.706/2014                                        Page 23 of 36</span>\n <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_98\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act must be construed in the same sense, as people in\nthe commercial world would understand the same. Thus, the expression,\n&#x27;other liability&#x27; would take within its broad sweep any &#x27;liability&#x27; to pay.\nThe Court also held that the term stipulating creation of a security deposit in\nfavour of the complainant was a fundamental term, breach whereof went to\nthe root of the contract, entitling the complainant to rescind the contract.\nThe Court, inter alia, observed:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">      &quot;31. A distinction has to be drawn between a cheque issued as\n      security and a cheque issued towards discharge of a liability to\n      pay notwithstanding that the money is by way of security for\n      due performance of the contract. A cheque given as security is\n      not to be encashed in presenti. It becomes enforceable if an\n      obligation is future is not enforced. It is not tendered in\n      discharge of a liability which has accrued.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">      32. Thus where a cheque forms part of a consideration under\n      a contract it is paid towards a liability.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_50\">43.   The Court also held that the expression, &#x27;consideration&#x27; used in the\n<a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_99\">Contract Act</a> is a very wide term, and it is not restricted to monetary benefit.\nConsideration does not necessarily mean money in return of money, or\nmoney in lieu of goods, or services. Any benefit or detriment of some value\ncan be a consideration. The Court held that the complainant and the other\nowners of the property blocked their asset till the period of completion of the\nconstruction as per the collaboration agreement.         The same was the\nconsideration within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/877630/\" id=\"a_100\">Section 2(d)</a> of the Indian Contract Act.\nThus, the reciprocal obligations of the builder, namely to create a security\ndeposit was also a consideration for the contract. Consequently, the court\ndismissed the quashing petition.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">CRL.L.P.

In Sai Auto Agencies through its partner Dnyandeo Ramdas Rane v.\nSheikh Yusuf Sheikh Umar, 2011 (1) Crimes 180, the defence of the\nrespondent/accused was that, in relation to purchase of a tractor and\nequipments from the appellant, five blank cheques were given only as\nsecurity. The respondent claimed that the complainant had already received\nthe entire purchase consideration, and that the cheque in question was\nwithout consideration. The Court rejected the defence of the accused that\nthe entire consideration stood paid to the appellant supplier. Relying upon\nBeena Shabeer (supra), the High Court observed:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">      &quot;7. ... ... ... Necessarily, the cheque given as a security, if\n      bounced, shall be the subject-matter of a prosecution under\n      <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_101\">Section 138</a> of the Act. So, the contention of the accused that\n      cheque (exhibit 28) was given only as a security will not\n      enable him to escape from the clutches of law&quot;.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_52\">                                                 (emphasis supplied)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\">45.   The High Court further held as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">      &quot;9. Even if blank cheque has been given towards liability or\n      even as security, when the liability is assessed and quantified, if\n      the cheque is filled up and presented to the bank, the person\n      who had drawn the cheque cannot avoid the criminal liability\n      arising out of <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_102\">Section 138</a> of the Negotiable Instruments Act&quot;.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_54\">      Thus, the myth that the dishonour of a cheque given as a security,\ncannot be the subject matter of a compliant under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_103\">Section 138</a> NI Act was\nbusted in this decision as well.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_55\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"186040901\" id=\"span_57\">46.

Respondent no.2 placed an order for\nsupply of machinery and spare parts on the company of the petitioner, and\ngave a cheque for Rs.90 lacs towards advance payment. The said cheque\nwas encashed by the company of the petitioner.        The company of the\npetitioner failed to deliver the machinery/spare parts. When approached, the\npetitioner expressed his inability to supply the machinery/spare parts and\nrequested the respondent no.2 to treat the amount of Rs.90 lacs, given as\nadvance payment, as a loan. The petitioner issued a post dated cheque for\nRs.70 lacs in favour of respondent no.2.          The said cheque, upon\npresentation, was repeatedly dishonoured by the drawee bank. Then the\npetitioner issued the three cheques in question of Rs.25 lacs each in favour\nof respondent no.2 as security, and stated that in the event of the cheque of\nRs.70 lacs being again dishonoured, respondent no.2 may encash the said\nthree cheques given as security. However, the cheque of Rs.70 lacs was\nonce again dishonoured on presentation. Respondent no.2 issued a legal\nnotice upon the petitioner and his company under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_106\">Section 138</a> of NI Act.\nHowever, no payment was made.

Another\nnotice under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_109\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act was issued in respect of the said\nthree cheques upon the petitioner and his company.

Therefore, it\nwas claimed that the three cheques of Rs.25 lacs each could not be stated to\nhave been issued in discharge of an existing liability and, therefore, it was\ncontended that <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_110\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act was not attracted.

The supplier claimed that the advance payment had to\nbe made, as it had to procure the parts from abroad.

It\nwas held that if the cheque is issued as an advance payment for purchase of\ngoods and, for any reason, purchase order is not carried to its logical\nconclusion either because of its cancellation or otherwise, and the material\nor goods for which the purchase order was placed is not supplied, the cheque\ncould not be held to have been drawn for an existing debt or liability. It was\nheld that the payment made by a cheque in the nature of advance payment\nindicates that at the time of drawal of cheque, there was no existing liability.\nWhile disagreeing with the view of this Court, the Supreme Court held as\nfollows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">      &quot;.... .... .... If at the time of entering into a contract, it is one of\n      the conditions of the contract that the purchaser has to pay the\n      amount in advance and there is breach of such condition then\n      purchaser may have to make good the loss that might have\n      occasioned to the seller but that does not create a criminal\n      liability under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_129\">Section 138</a>. For a criminal liability to be made\n      out under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_130\">Section 138</a>, there should be legally enforceable\n      debt or other liability subsisting on the date of drawal of the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_71\">CRL.L.P.

In this case, the post\ndated cheque had been issued by the accused while placing the order for\nsupply of goods. However, the supply of goods was not made by the\ncomplainant. Consequently, the accused first instructed the bank to stop\npayment of the cheque, and then requested the complainant not to present\nthe cheque as the goods had not been supplied.

The petitioner, Haryana Petrochemicals had issued\ncheques in lieu of supply of chemicals by the respondent Indian\nPetrochemicals, which had been dishonoured upon presentation.            The\nlearned Magistrate had convicted the petitioners under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_141\">Section 138</a> of NI\nAct.    The said judgment was endorsed by the learned Sessions Judge.\nConsequently, a revision has been preferred before the High Court. The\nprimary submission of the petitioner was that the cheques in question were\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_77\">CRL.L.P. No.706/2014                                     Page 31 of 36</span>\n security cheques, as it was a regular trade practice that after the goods had\nbeen received by the petitioner company, fresh cheques in lieu of the\nsecurity cheques were issued by the petitioners. It was argued that the\nsecurity cheques, by themselves, would not constitute a legal debt or liability\nof the petitioner towards the complainant. The Court observed that the\nmanner in which the parties transacted their business was, that the\ncomplainant company would send the goods along with the invoices as per\nthe value of the goods. The petitioner/purchaser enjoyed a credit facility,\ni.e. the payment was not to be made immediately upon receipt of goods. For\nthis reason, the security cheques were issued by the petitioner at the time of\ntaking delivery of the goods. However, they were to be returned upon\nreceipt of payment by the respondent/seller.       In case payment was not\nforthcoming, the security cheques were considered as consideration towards\nsupply of goods, and the respondent would bank the cheques. The cheques\nin question had similarly been banked since payment was not otherwise\nmade by the petitioner/accused on the expiry of the credit period.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_66\">56.   This Court, by placing reliance on Beena Shabeer (supra), rejected\nthe petitioner&#x27;s submission that the cheques in question being security\ncheques could not be the foundation of a complaint under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_142\">Section 138</a> of NI\nAct. In the present case as well, the transaction clearly stipulated that the\ncheques in question were issued as security cheques, which were to be\nreturned upon receiving payment in installments of Rs.50,000/- each from\nthe respondent/accused by cheque. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"35082018\" id=\"span_78\">The only difference is that in <a href=\"/doc/35082018/\" id=\"a_143\">Haryana\nPetrochemicals Ltd.</a> (supra), the Court found that as a matter of the inter se\ndealings between the parties, whenever the payment was not made at the end\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_79\">CRL.L.P. No.706/2014                                        Page 32 of 36</span>\n of the credit period, the security cheques were banked for realization of the\namount due. However, in the present case, there is no express agreement of\nthe parties to this effect, and there is no established practice of this nature\nbetween the parties. Pertinently, the MOU (Ex. CW-1/4) does not expressly\nprohibit the appellant/ complainant from banking the security cheques, in\ncase the installments are not paid on the due dates.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_67\">57.   At this stage, I consider it appropriate to analyse as to what is the\nmeaning of the word &quot;security&quot;.       What does the issuance of a security\ncheque entail, and if there is no specific agreement touching upon this\naspect, what would be the rights and obligations of the parties qua a security\ncheque, in case the primary obligation - to secure which the security cheque\nwas given, is not discharged. The Black&#x27;s Law Dictionary (6th edition), inter\nalia, defines &quot;security&quot; to mean:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">      &quot;Protection; assurance; Indemnification. The term is usually\n      applied to an obligation, pledge, mortgage, deposit, lien, etc.,\n      given by a debtor in order to assure the payment or\n      performance of his debt, by furnishing the creditor with a\n      resource to be used in case of failure in the principal\n      obligation. Collateral given by debtor to secure loan.\n      Document that indicates evidence of indebtedness. The name is\n      also sometimes given to one who becomes surety or guarantor\n      for another&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_68\">                                                    (Emphasis supplied)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_69\">58.   Similarly, the word &quot;security&quot; is defined in the Shorter Oxford\nEnglish Dictionary (5th edition), inter alia, to mean:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">      &quot;Property etc. deposited or pledged by or on behalf of a person\n      as a guarantee of the fulfillment of an obligation (as an\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_80\">CRL.L.P.

Thus, when one party gives a security to the other, implicit in the said\ntransaction is the understanding that in case of failure of the principal\nobligation, the security may be enforced.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_72\">60.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1577621\" id=\"span_81\">In <a href=\"/doc/1577621/\" id=\"a_144\">V.K. Ashokan v. CCE</a>, (2009) 14 SCC 85, the Supreme Court\nobserved that:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">      &quot;The term &quot;security&quot; signifies that which makes secure or\n      certain. It makes the money more assured in its payment or\n      more readily recoverable as distinguished from, as for example,\n      a mere IOU, which is only evidence of a debt, and the word is\n      not confined to a document which gives a charge on specific\n      property, but includes personal securities for money. (See\n      Chetumal Bulchand v. Noorbhoy Jafeerji, AIR 1928 Sind 89).\n      It is a word of general import signifying an assurance&quot;.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_73\">61.   Thus, in my view, it makes no difference whether, or not, there is an\nexpress understanding between the parties that the security may be enforced\nin the event of failure of the debtor to pay the debt or discharge other\nliability on the due date. Even if there is no such express agreement, the\nmere fact that the debtor has given a security in the form of a post dated\ncheque or a current cheque with the agreement that it is a security for\nfulfillment of an obligation to be discharged on a future date itself, is\nsufficient to read into the arrangement, an agreement that in case of failure\nof the debtor to make payment on the due date, the security cheque may be\npresented for payment, i.e. for recovery of the due debt. If that were not so,\nthere would be no purpose of obtaining a security cheque from the debtor. A\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_82\">CRL.L.P. No.706/2014                                       Page 34 of 36</span>\n security cheque is issued by the debtor so that the same may be presented for\npayment. Otherwise, it would not be a security cheque. As observed above,\nthe MOU (Ex.CW-1/4) does not expressly, or even impliedly states that the\nsecurity cheques are not to be used to recover the installments, even in case\nof failure to pay the same by the respondent/ debtor.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_74\">62.   <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_145\">Section 138</a> of NI Act does not distinguish between a cheque issued\nby the debtor in discharge of an existing debt or other liability, or a cheque\nissued as a security cheque on the premise that on the due future date the\ndebt which shall have crystallized by then, shall be paid. So long as there is\na debt existing, in respect whereof the cheque in question is issued, in my\nview, the same would attract <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_146\">Section 138</a> of NI Act in case of its dishonour.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_75\">63.   Thus, the defence that the cheques in question Ex. CW-1/1, CW-1/2\nand CW-1/3 were issued as &quot;security&quot; cheques has no force in the facts and\ncircumstances of this case, as, on the date when the said cheques were issued\nsimultaneously with the execution of the MOU (Ex. CW-1/4), the debt of\nRs.1.5 lacs was outstanding. The appellant was well within his rights to\nenforce the security in respect whereof the cheques in question were issued\nand to seek to recover the outstanding debt by encashment of the said\ncheques. Since the cheques in question were dishonoured upon presentation,\nthe accused suffered all consequences as provided for in law and the\nappellant became entitled to invoke all his rights as created by law. Thus,\nthe appellant was entitled to invoke <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_147\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act; issue the\nstatutory notice of demand, and; upon failure of the accused to make\npayment in terms of notice of demand - to initiate the complaint under\n<a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_148\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_83\">CRL.L.P.

The learned Magistrate has returned findings of fact which are\npalpably wrong; its approach in dealing with evidence is patently illegal; its\ndecision is based on an erroneous view of the law, and; the impugned\njudgment, if sustained, would lead to grave miscarriage of justice.
